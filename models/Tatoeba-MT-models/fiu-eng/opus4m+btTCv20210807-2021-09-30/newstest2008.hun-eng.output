European inflation has fallen on food
Accelerated inflation in the eurozone is mainly due to the rapid growth of food prices.
The rise in the euro area in November was higher than expected in 13 countries, with a 3.1 percent annual inflation after 2.6 percent in October – reported by the EU statistical office in Luxembourg.
The official forecast was only 3 percent likely – Bloomberg said.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut the basic gap, saying that reducing would lead to inflation spirals with rising raw materials prices and mild unemployment.
Under 2% of the ECB, but would like to keep the inflation rate close to it.
According to an analyst, the ECB is trapped in twenty-two traps: “We need to talk about inflation, so that it does not have to take action later on this topic.
In Germany, inflation in November is estimated to be twelve years of record; Spain rose from 4.6 to 4.1.
Eurozone inflation has been reduced to a high level by rising food and energy prices.
The scheduled wheat notes increased by 88 percent and the exchange rate of soy beans reached the highest value since 1973.
Food and dairy products also had to be paid significantly more in 2007.
The world market price of oil increased by 52 percent this year, and last month nearly $100 has already cost a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation is falling from 2.1 to 2.5% this year in 2008, but in 2009 it has fallen to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3% in the next 3-4 months, but the annual average rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce interest twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The support circle of Fidesz has grown significantly since early December, so since 2002 he has the largest camp, while Gallup has not measured such low socialist support before.
In the case of certain parties, the difference - due to the greater determination of opposition voters - would be more than two-thirds (71%) of support from the MSZP against one-fifth (20%) of support.
According to the survey, the MDF and the SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their support within the entire population is two percent.
The supporters of both camps are one per cent more than one per cent.
The economic public opinion has been able to further deteriorate to the previous point - it has never been so high, 41% of the country's economic situation has been considered particularly bad, while 46 percent of the country's economic situation is quite bad.
The changes in their own financial situation are now re-examined once again after more hopeful views in spring and summer.
For the next year, the largest half of the population is expected to decline with further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In December, more than 71 percent of those surveyed by Gallup believed that the Prime Minister was doing his job wrong than the prime minister did well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13% of the surveyees trust or trust, while 38% of the supporters are at Viktor Orbán.
54% do not trust the Prime Minister, 27% in the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators for the development of the political situation is that what part of society thinks it is possible to address dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister without a change of government.
While, after last October's disruptions, 35 percent of the government and the Head of Government considered desirable, this rate is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees only the solution in describing new elections.
It is a question of interest in the referendum that 60 percent of those surveyed responds to the question of willingness to participate, that they will surely leave, and another 20% will say that they will probably leave.
As a comparison, a “now on Sunday’s election of the Parliament – only 55% would certainly participate and another 15 percent would be likely to participate. The result of the referendum would not be questionable on the basis of today’s intentions.
The tuition fees would be 74, 79, and 84% would say no to the hospital's daily fee.
If we only look at the same proportions among those who promise to participate in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would introduce tuition fees, visa fees and hospital daily fees.
The most expensive of Auchan, near the fifth of the Tesco
In the Budaur trade triangle, hypermarkets held a 16 percent increase in prices last year, with the difference that the VAT did not rise this year.
The Day Economy article
This year, there was an average 16 percent increase in the daily daily Christmas basket in the Budaörs trade triangle, but in each hypermarket there was a significant increase in the value of over 1,000 HUF.
Since prices in food stores have already been passed on in December last year, there has been no dramatic gliding in comparison to the previous high base.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they received last year in 9,000 forints, they are not getting it for even tens of thousands.
The daily basket reached the maximum of 91 forints in the hypermarket.
The highest score was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, the basket cost 6800 forints.)
The price of Unicum and the living fish remained almost at the level of last year, but the turkey fillet, nuts, and livers were also heavily tilted.
KSH followed the price of flour and bread in stores, although in Auchan we also found a kilogram of bread for 139 forints.
The competition did not depress the price of the product under 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this business that the price of the two-litre restitutable bottle Coca-Cola was under 200 HUF, so, together with the deposit fee, only 257 HUF for the product was requested.
This year, however, Auchan showed the most expensive in the sun’s basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our estimates, Cora 15, compared to last year’s Christmas prices, while Tesco and Auchan increased the prices in the Sun’s cart by about 18-18%.
Compared to last year’s most expensive and cheapest basket value, the difference was 12%, while last year’s cheapest and most expensive is 21% growth.
In Forint, on average, 1480 was the growth.
Last year, the average price increase came out to HUF 1206, with the effect of an increase in VAT in prices last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has split the trade, it is apparent that the stores could not decide how much price is applied to one product, because they were unable to calculate the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a product’s rotation rate is poorly designed by the trader, it may be so beneficial to be adjusted to traffic intensity.)
The price increase of the Sun’s basket was so extreme last year due to the VAT, that the most expensive HUF 1720 was more than the 2006 value, while only HUF 844 was the cheapest.
This year, this extreme was not shown, since the most expensive was 1630 forints than last year, and the cheapest was 1284 forints.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, catastrophic price increases showed a 30% increase in daily consumption in hypermarkets in less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily justify KSH data: for some basic foods, the statistical agency has measured a price increase of more than 30% over 12 months.
For example, in addition to the flour, it is also in the egg.)
According to the daily cart, this seems almost impossible in the last year, because the price level of the product has already been rather expensive compared to the base, in the worst case, produced a price increase of less than 10%.
List suppliers appear to be in a stronger position than eggards, the dramatic price increase has also been overcome by the multifaceted.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypers do not complain, they keep reporting about a good year.
According to our experience, the number of customers in the three stores visited is no longer interested in prices.
They buy a lot of food from everything, and they bring it to the plateaus.
On Wednesday morning, all three stores developed serious lines before the money prices, because the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, we know that traffic is worse in the countryside, more than one complains to research companies that even plans are missing income, and not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, they save on disinfectants
More than 1,000 infections were registered in hospitals this year, mainly due to inadequate use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the tightness of beds, the overload of staff does not promote the stopping of infections, says the head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
They also save on disinfectants in many places.
Recently, MRSA was diagnosed in the traumatological class of the John’s Hospital.
After a serious accident, a bacterium resistant to antibiotics was shown in a man admitted.
The patient was separated.
Similar infections occurred at the beginning of the year.
A serious car accident was released from the hospital, but soon thereafter, it had to return with an MRSA infection, and no major surgery had ever been performed due to the bacteria in your body.
By December 10, 1094, hospital infections caused by multi-responsive disease were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveyance System, said the head of the National Epidemiological Centre, Börécz Karolina.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-responsive diseases have been registered in hospitals, and the rest cannot be known.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried by one-third of people without the nose causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, mandula inflammation, skin infections, wound infection) respond well to antibiotics, can be cured well.
However, if antibiotics are used too much or not properly, the bacteria that react to antibiotics are highly resistant to antibiotics, which rapidly spreads under inadequate medical conditions.
The immune system may cause severe hospital infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, in patients with a weakened, old or low body weight, temporarily or permanently poor functioning.
According to the medical director at the John’s Hospital, there is nothing special about the MRSA infection, such infections belong to the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection must not be mixed with the driver, MRSA is not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where they do not investigate the presence of the diseaser.
Resistance to antibiotics
“We separate such patients from nursing staff in rubber gloves and masks, and they have the right antibiotics for their treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients in the hospital are examined in the first place whether MRSA is present in their body, but it is not always possible to avoid infection.
It is not fashionable to sample
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA would be preventable, but current domestic hospital conditions and conditions are not favourable to preventing the development and spread of multi-responsive diseases, says Börécz Karolina.
Once this infection is typically occurring in hospitals, in elderly homes, hospitals should check the patients who enter, and patients who carry MRSA should be immediately separated.
However, there is no microbiological sampling in Hungarian hospitals.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these studies.
Most cases thus occur when the patient has an detectable MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are national policies to cure certain infections and diseases.
The aim should be to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological studies should be carried out so as not to develop resistance to drugs, but hospitals should not be kept in use in all cases.
Microbiological samples are even less frequent in the care and care of the disease, Börécz Karolina said.
Save in disinfectants
Scientific evidence confirms that MRSA is the most frequent transmission of healthcare personnel from one patient to the other.
Therefore, handwashing, gloves, mask use has a very large role to play, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA is exposed to drops, contact, but in domestic hospital conditions, there is no possibility to isolate the infected patient.
In addition, the hospitals are often crowded, often very close to each other, while patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other from the epidemiological point of view.
Unfortunately, Börécz Karolina also noted that in hospitals in poor financial situations they save on disinfectants, few nurses, many patients, so there is even greater chance of developing infections.
According to Börcz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are taken, there may be less such infection or the spread of the disease may be stopped.
Government Programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection causes huge expenses for health insurance companies, so they fight against it everywhere.
In England, for example, the Government Programme included a reduction in the prevention or occurrence of MRSA.
The program appears to be a successful, reported data suggest that MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) include the prevention of multiple-responsive diseases (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
He was not drunk at the police station that caused the fatal accident.
The official expert opinion on the fatal accident caused by the 21st district police captain was prepared.
It can be ruled out that in a drunk or bloated state, the 21st district police captain, who died on Tuesday, informed Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the General Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday after an expert opinion on this issue has been prepared.
The expert opinion confirmed the primary test result, which has already found that the former police officer did not consume alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
The leader of the 21st district station had hit the 55-year-old man on Tuesday on the street of the XXII, who did not want to cross the road to the designated pedestrian point.
(The latter, therefore, is that the pedestrian does not cross the Zebra, according to the rules of the KRESZ, is, by the way, a non-relieving circumstance, the canyon car driver must also give priority.)
The infant died after he was transported to the hospital.
Because of what happened, the police chief of the district resigned from his post and asked for his arrest, according to the police, because the case was so shaken.
In this case, the Budapest Attorney General will continue to investigate.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police officer was working with the prosecutors who were investigating the investigation from the beginning.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
A total of €400 million has been signed by John Veres and Vice-President Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Friday.
The European Development Bank (EIB) has approved a €300 million framework for the Hungarian financing of the Cohesion Fund in 2006, of which €100 million loan agreements have already been concluded by the parties, the agreement now signed is about the use of the remaining €200 million.
The education-related projects also provide budgetary funding for the €150 million loan agreement.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million may be spent later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a €50 million contract, which is mainly used for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
The 4th metro was also discussed at the meeting.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, they will return to whether and how the original agreement should be amended.
According to John Veres, this may take place in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has funded 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion since 1990.
The loan portfolio shall be provided by the EIB with a period of 8 years of patience and without a maintenance commission.
Bulgaria is the EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing – the attention of Europe as a whole is focused on a few previously mentioned Balkan countries.
Where and where do the EU buy in the cheapest but fast-flavoured market?
Analysis of the division of Re/Max Bulgarian.
The most popular shopping destination in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap flat apartments and coastal houses.
Among the mountains are the most divisive regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, along the coast of Albana, the \"Aranypart\", the \"Napospart\", the ancient Sozopol and Neszebar, but more and more people are looking for property in Kavarna and Balcsik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, the central part of the country will, sooner or later, raise the interest of investors – including Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people buy in the area of cheap Rusz.
The capital, Sofia also offers attractive opportunities, commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive European golf parades, making it one of the top destinations in the second two seasons in addition to the summer and winter season.
For this reason, forward-looking investors are already buying heavily, for example, in the area of Banszko.
According to analysts, in Bulgaria, real estate buyers are also trying to change their way of life.
Most customers are English, but come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
The Maltese and Cyprus investors are also present, and Russian buyers are traditionally present in the Black Sea and ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settlers or refurbished properties are bought at a price of between €50 and €100,000, or flat old houses for €5-15,000 and then refurbished.
It requires good access and communication opportunities, it is important to them the proximity of a large city, shops, and usually a local doctor.
The second category was the first 10 German holiday destinations in December (Bulgaria was included in the list).
The third group is made up of business investors who buy in the hope of medium- to long-term growth.
The gliding of capital properties is continuing, as demand is increasing.
In Bulgaria, real estate prices are the lowest in the European Union, but in the last five years they have grown by 21%.
The increase in real estate prices is basically higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six Hungarians
According to Mr Fodor's Minister of the Environment and Water, expert meetings will be completed on Tuesday, and after the formal opening on Wednesday, the negotiations of the post-2012 international climate regime will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Road Plan, which provides for efforts to follow the emission reduction period set by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
There is currently a strong debate between developing and developing countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not intend to negotiate precise numbers at present, although it tends to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another major issue of the conference is whether developed countries are also committed to providing both material and technological assistance to those countries that need it.
The agreement has also been reached on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, which is provided by the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by the Management Board of 16 members, which is expected to be available within the UN Global Environmental Fund (GEF) - in the Market and Profit.
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Mr Fodor Gábor supports the EU's efforts to maintain the role of a flagship in global climate protection efforts and to facilitate the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister explained that the EU will undertake a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990, regardless of the success of the conclusion of the post-2012 Convention, and is ready to reduce by up to 30%, in the event that other major developed areas of the world and developing countries are willing to commit to their responsibilities and capabilities.
In 1997, Gábor Fodor pointed out that a reduction of 5.2 per cent was set in total in the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol, including the EU's 15 Member States, minus 8%.
The Hungarian obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the 1985-87 period, which will be carried out by our country. - recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
A high stake in Bali, as the long-term international climate policy agreement must be brought under cover within two years, otherwise its entry into force would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by another international emission reduction system, which would be necessary in the latest report of the IPCC, the UN Nobel Peace Prize, climate change and the International Scientific Panel on Climate Change.
With this, the reduction in emissions would be delayed and inevitable by the growth of the Earth's average temperature above 2 degrees Celcius, which scientists believe would have extremely severe and irreversible consequences.
The British army recruits on YouTube
In Iraq and Afghanistan, records are published on video distribution by British military units that promote themselves.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) got to YouTube: since March 2006, special developments in Afghanistan have been performing videos of their anti-Babytes actions - the BBC announced.
These mini-treamed, helmet-mounted camera recordings are controlled by the operation command of the Air Force in Kanhar, and will be sent to London, where the domestics upload them to the internet.
The political message is inevitable.
Air Force soldiers have already recorded 139 recordings on the internet in this form, and their “channel” has been viewed more than 75 thousand.
The British Ministry of Defence (Defenceheadquarters) is registered in spring 2007, and it publishes videos about both Iraqi and Afghan activities, while the British Ministry of National Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and Iraqi international peacekeeping teams (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Action in Afghanistan
According to the Air Force's original intention to recruit videos for recruitment purposes, and according to the Department of Defense, it is also good to explore the real purpose of the military's foreign presence with the public.
The propaganda published in such a form does not cost almost anything compared to the traditional television recruitment ads, he said to the BBC, the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie, but he carries some political message indiscriminately, as it demonstrates the existence of military actions decided by the government in a specific form.
The Americans made a game
In addition to carefully edited, censored images, the army also has a problem with the distribution of amateur videos, which, for example, show the death of soldiers: in a slightly visual, “official” propaganda films, officers speak the most about the losses, but do not show the bloody side of the fight.
Of course, a number of videos from Iraq and Afghanistan have already been released on the internet, which was made on sharp missions, but the British army has only recently received it.
The Americans are doing a little differently, with a free downloadable American's Army shooting game in which the player can hide directly into the military's skin in a more or less life-long simulation.
Tombing and Pogging Christmas at the Ministry
The Minister of Labour of Lamperth Mónika does not seem emotionally emotional: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold an annual work conference with her staff, who can welcome her with pogacs and coffee from 2007.
There will be a department where there will be a live music party, somewhere else with a tombola and jogging, enchanting a Christmas mood in the hearts of the officials.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffets - so amuse the power.
Public offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest standard of the Ministry of Christmas party is held this year by the Ministry of Defence wallet, but the HM is not waiting for the Ministry staff.
On Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive a gift, and the members of the soldiers who are currently serving foreign missions in the Mission Christmas will be invited, but they will also host a press reception.
The wallet takes 25 million to the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport (GKM) will be fired from prison compared to other wallets.
The GKM party is held in the Future House, with a total of 4 320 000 forints, and a total of about 300 guests from six hundred ministry workers.
At the celebration of the wallet they will stick to the Christmas atmosphere, but there will also be performers and drummers.
The Christmas of the NFÜ was held in 4 700 000 HUF, and it was held in the National Council of Justice (OIT) building on Wednesday - concerts and dinners.
The plot cost a million forints, the remaining part was spent on more than four hundred invites.
We know that one class of the NFU is also official for another Christmas celebration: it is organised by a company that manages the Hungarian Economy Development Centre from EU funds.
The building was rented for this purpose.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt as we failed to reach the competent.
You don't need a suit.
The building of OIT saw not only the NFU as a guest, but also the Ministry of Justice and Order, which held the Luca-Day Ball instead of Christmas on 7 December.
He did not ask for money to use OIT's rooms.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the minister's greeting, and it was possible to dance live music after dinner.
They asked the question of [origo]: the ball was not mandatory for the evening dress or suit.
Puritan party is organized by health, work and municipal wallet.
The Ministry of Health organizes a show and celebration for employees for HUF 400 000.
The Minister of Labour Lamperth Mónika, however, is not officially looking for a Christmas party, but is looking forward to her staff at the end of the year.
One hundred and eight guests are expected to receive only coffee and pogacs, and the party will be taken out of 350,000 forints.
The Minister of Local Government of Basnai Gordon, however, will simply co-finance with his staff in the honor of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) has held a Christmas meeting in its own big room, for which 436 employees are expected.
Each guest wants 2500 for the Christmas party - the sum includes a buffet bet and a coccination.
Since John Veres has been a minister, the PM workers have been like this every year.
But there will be no bullying, and the formality will not only be confirmed by the minister's speech, but also by the afternoon.
On January 20th, the Ministry of Agriculture will receive a New Year's reception, and the Ministry will miss Christmas.
The reception is held in Vajdahunyadvár, the City Village, and according to the wallet, 1,000 forints per hundred guests per head.
This, according to the press class, will be a very simple standing bet, for which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are official.
These bets start with a short greeting each year and finish with a narrow-cut bite.
There is no Christmas party with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Education and Culture - they announced with the [origo] in the relevant press classes.
The price of the official Christmas of the environmental wallet could not be said in the press class.
More than 400 people were invited to the party at the Museum of Fine Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are growing
On Friday, the National Association of Liga Professional Organizations and Labour Councils will be formed by their committee on Monday, in an indefinite strike.
They are holding a general meeting on Saturday, on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - and the suspension begins.
The action in transport will certainly lead to a significant threat, as rail traffic will almost completely stop, and they will strike at BKV for 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the Liga Trade Organizations will present details of the Monday strike organised jointly with the National Labour Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ Strike Committee will also be set up, which will coordinate Monday's activities.
They will hold a meeting on Saturday, and from Monday to Monday, the organisations joining the strike will terminate the work for an indefinite period of time if they are unable to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that it was not indicated, on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act, the date on which the strikes started.
If the National Assembly did not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will withdraw the strike call immediately.
However, if you vote for the law, the strike committees will meet and decide on the continuation.
On the basis of the agenda of the National Assembly on Monday, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will be voted only in late night, perhaps in night hours.
Due to the strike that began on Monday, significant threats can be expected in transport: work will be discontinued at rail for an indefinite period, a part of public transport in Budapest may be stopped before noon, more than half of the Volan companies.
At the same time, there will also be semi-track road closures at many points in the country.
A number of trade unions and NGOs have joined the strike call, the list of these are constantly updated on the day of the League.
Some organisations have reported a strike for an indefinite period of time, others have declared a temporary termination of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Free Trade Union of MÁV and Railway Workers (VDSSZ) could not even agree on a sufficient service, but as Christmas holidays are approaching, more and more people travel on rail.
According to previous announcements, a four-hour strike at BKV, between 7 and 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, has been held by the LIGA Electrical and Heat Industry Professionals Organizations, 2 and 2 to 8 hours of work, and the Democratic Association of Pedagogues.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes in a country, changing times, a two-hour warning strike by the Democratic Professional Organisation (EDDSSZ) of the SZEF-based Health and Social Sector.
The most important of the four claims made by the League is that the government withdraws the proposal for reform of health insurance and that it issue a new concept for social debate.
The second requirement is to gradually introduce a new method of retirement from next year.
The third is to ensure that, in the case of a senior pension, the possibility of entry into the system for decent jobs before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Organisation of Railway Workers (VDSZ) of the Liga Trade Organisation does not accept the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport’s offer of railway lines, other offers are expected.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard raised the risk of the country
The Hungarian Guard, founded in August of this year, has raised the political risk of Hungary and the region according to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division).
The company’s “risk warning” said: “As far as the activities of the Hungarian Guard are concerned, violent ethnic conflicts can develop in the short term as well as violent ethnic conflicts between the Gypsy of Hungary and the non-Gypsy population.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to be aimed at prosecuting such an act, the research institute added.
As it was written, this is due to one of the main omissions of Hungarian political actors: “The public debate on Roma was handed over to representatives of radical and extreme political groups who could build a political strategy for the anti-Gypsy Hungarian opposition.
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - they believe.
In addition, according to the Research Institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, in the light of the large domestic and international media surveillance, have been a major source of faith in Hungary abroad, especially in the stability and democratic development of the country.
It is recalled that, from the autumn of 2006, it has become increasingly public and has gained momentum in the resumption of radical and extreme-right groups in Hungary, that it has also been formed in Hungary by more organisations called \"national self-defense\" in the summer of 2007.
\"The common concern of these compressions is that they define themselves as a civil organization, while they openly advertised the preparation of their members, whether armed, for defence (catastrophic, civil protection, law enforcement), and also the police, referring to the inadequacies of the military, or the state,\" they added.
It was noted that this is done in accordance with the method which, based on the political and political neutrality of society, seeks to put different political aspirations into civil baptism.
The emphasis on civil society and the form of association, therefore, are not only intended to avoid the legal failure of court records in these societies, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, and the ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by reference to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this affects the political stability of the region – they added.
According to the Research Institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
As it was written, the Hungarian Guard’s operation is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, the establishment of which was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian guerrilla, there are massive Roma disruptions that broke out in one quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
Using this, BNU decided to set up a dam, saying that the purpose of the organization is to \"national self-defense\".
In the last 17 years, they found that there was a “serious terror” in Bulgaria, but the state remained in vain and indifferent – the Political Capital recalls.
They added that the initiative had a strong debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it was written, the increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations indicates that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that resistance is created by a coward’s own dam.
Since the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has shown similarities with the functioning of the Bulgarian National Guard so far, it is therefore impossible to exclude that the Roma in Hungary react similarly to the threat of their own self-defense - it can be read in the risk warning of the Political Capital.
Attila Juhas, research director of the Political Capital, said that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they will issue their risk analysis every year and if they experience any kind of risk that may affect the change of risk, they will inform the public as in this case with the release of the risk warning.
The holiday is not everywhere red.
In Hungary, the law accurately lists the red-written days, and around the holidays it has become a general practice for the day-to-day transition, from which it will be less for the next year.
In the EU and America, the holiday is not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and holidays.
Working holidays are mostly related to church holidays, and are important historical events.
We celebrate the new year: the last day of the year and the new first day of the year, the latter is only to rest in order for the spiritists to rest themselves.
All year round, we have a total of eleven red-written holidays.
The National Day of the Revolution of 1848 is March 15 and October 23, the Memorial Day of the 1956 Revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the establishment of the state, on May 1, we celebrate the work, and on November 1 and 2 we remember our relatives and friends.
In addition, we have a two-day holiday for Easter, your punk and Christmas.
Since our public, national or religious holidays rarely fall for the weekend according to the calendar, working days have become a practice in cases where we would only work for one day before or after the red-word holiday.
The price of extended weekends is that we will not stay away from work on previous Saturdays.
The fact that the day immediately preceding or following the holiday is exactly when to be processed has been regulated by a special regulation by the Minister of Labour for many years.
The legislation covers all employers and workers employed by them, public servants and those in public service law.
However, it does not affect companies and institutions operating without interruption and, as a result of their purpose, also operating on working days.
This year, it is only about the end of the year that the working schedule is changed: from 24 December, life stops in the country, because, according to experience, Christmas and New Year’s days between the majority of people are “slipped” or use their lost freedom for this purpose.
Next year, we have more holidays in the middle of the week, and the end of the week, so there will be less work day placement than this year.
First, the calendar takes place around the holiday of work, so that workers can stay at home for four days.
The Saturday of April 26 will be a working day in exchange for the Friday of May 2.
The second transfer is linked to the 23 October celebration: on 18 October, you will have to work on Saturday instead of the 24th on Friday.
However, the end of the year can end in full in the celebration of the holiday, as from 24 December almost everywhere, they will hold a nonstop break even if the New Year falls on Wednesday.
Six terrible little things to piss your colleagues off.
Emails we forget to send are voice mails that we never get, innocent lies that we don’t even notice anymore: these are “colored” at work every day.
The question is whether you are used to minor discomforts or wear gloves, and you are consciously avoiding misunderstanding situations that cause revenge for others.
Tips.
“I forgot to tell you that you were looking for a marketing department,” your colleague said.
That's why you missed a meeting?
In the best case, you regret and try to make things right, maybe you call the marketing class to tell you you forgot to pass the message (this is a less common solution).
Most of the time, it's an apology.
Before it comes to torture, it is worth considering what it is to make uncomfortable moments for your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid it.
Are you buying something that's not yours?
There's no more annoying when you touch for a document, office, or phone, and that's nowhere.
Remember that you put your fire machine on the table last night, but he had his foot on the morning?
Perhaps you will reveal your lost pen on the desk of one of your colleagues?
Without asking, don’t take anything from your colleagues, because they will rightly be angry with you to ride their property.
Do not pocket office envelopes, post-it, because it may be unpleasant if you run out of time and you need it right away.
Are you asking about the privacy of colleagues?
There is no good way to stop the rumor.
Who, who, who, what did you do?
Where and why?
Do not bind your colleagues’ privacy to everyone’s nose.
If one of them shares his inner secrets with you, don’t live back with your trust.
Put the hearings in you, and do not negotiate with your staff in your absence, even if others know about the things your colleague has carried.
Do you mean unreasonably sick?
When you call the office and refer to a fiery headache, you report a patient because you feel bad about it or you feel that you would rather rest that day; think of your work, your irrevocable actions, your scheduled work should be done by someone else instead of you.
Don't mess with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to go into the office, or you can come up with something that you need to stay home for, tell your colleagues and your boss not to face your absence the next day.
Squirting, squirting, calling
Did you fall in love with the work, but that's how the colleague's snore?
Have you been an unwitting ear teacher for a phone chat that would not have been better to hear?
Don’t bother your staff with dubbing, singing, loud conversation (which you continue above your head) or with footbrows, constant damage, loud dissatisfaction.
They can all be disturbing, even if they do not get involved in a project (writing, planning, organisation).
Do you blame others for mistakes?
If you don't have time, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, no more for your memory.
Don't refer to any chaos in the office, your voiceful colleagues.
Remember, if you made a mistake, and the disadvantage of others came from it, and eliminate it.
Ask yourself how to make your mistake right, make sure you miss it.
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Maccones and slippers: comfortable clothing for home, but not in the office!
Don’t wear comfortable leisure clothes if your job allows you to work.
Don’t be a lampman, your colleagues, and respect yourself with your regular clothes - if you require your job, you’re going to the office pretty, elegantly!
If you want to answer, you're no longer interesting.
Dropping the car in the usual breakfast jam.
There is a special sound from the radio: the sound of a violin that is associated with electronic effects.
I'm going to move the volume up.
The music has changed at a pace and the previous sound colors come in next to the bass, and then as a real jewel, the female choir is connected.
The number of Zagar Wings of Love is on the mr2.
For a long time, domestic music life has not spoiled us with high-quality electronic pop.
But now it seems to be a whole lot different when you listen to the new Zagar record.
Yonderboi’s appearance, a few new and exciting productions coming from the home digital underground, slowly change in the picture, and in spite of the fashion of the guitar garage rock, the domestic electropop will prove: there is new under the sun.
Zúser started from Pécs, and he himself played in Yonderbo's band until, perhaps, because two duds didn't fall in a czarade, he took his own trip.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, which combines jazz, electronic dance music, pop elements, however, he began to break through when film soundtracks were asked to be composed (e.g.
Turkish Ferenc Sezon).
In the beginning, a wider audience met the formations of smaller clubs when their first album of the Wan2 magazine in 2002 was ranked among the fifty most important home albums, and Zagar, in Yonderboi's company, shouted for domestic trends that were almost exclusively marketable in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and the band became a trendy, but no one asked them whether they would like to wear the label.
The band responded as it should: he made a new, better album.
Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new albums for them, although the title itself wants to create continuity with the early Pécs years.
This was one of Zézer's former orchestras.
With the flying, flying reference we would be in place, but in addition to the air of music, we have now appeared, according to the spirit of the age, the more loud guitar, the effect of rock and roll.
In these songs, at the Millennial premiere of the album, the singer, György Ligeti, currently working with the Puzzle band in England, showed himself.
The album also produced a real radio hit, and again from the morning to the evening, Mr. Petőfi began to emulate the huge songs of Wings of Love recorded in the ears with the six home singers, Underground Divas.
Is everything okay (?)
The Hvg.hu Züzer asked.
hvg.hu: This new Slager now raises the question: how much remains of the layer music you play?
The definition of layer music does not mean too much to me.
I think there are two kinds of light music cats; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but comedy and honest.
The so-called alternative underground music can be flat, nothing to say, and can be made exclusively for sale, which makes them a comedian.
But a good pop can come from a sincere start.
Your attitude to the host works in the spirit of this, regardless of language and country boundaries.
Hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
Zs.B.: There are bigger traditions of light music from abroad, especially from us.
There, not only is the 12-year-old class going to concerts, but also older ones.
They are more closely observing the slight changes around them, because they are also part of the contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good to see more and more of our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
We have music not for purposes, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived at concerts where it is already working on each other, but it is only reflected in the inconceptible changes of the moment.
However, I noticed that if you want to answer the audience, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works in solo, and he built his career deeper from us.
Zs.B.: We are not really on his way, regardless of sometimes trying to explain it to our music.
We are more like team players who trust in the other musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work was compared to Yonderboi’s music, since many of us were separated from his band and started on another road.
Hvg.hu: On the top list of Mr2 Petőfi, the Wings of Love was first place.
Many people first heard the name Zagar.
Are you consciously open with a more popular style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a striker and then sell the disc.
This song is about more.
We were looking for the final of the album, trying to remove the sound orgy and difficult themes on the disc until then.
Hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why are they – what was the leader?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
That’s when the idea came to create this choir from the good speakers of our own home music scene.
This is how the six-member choir – Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Enikő Hodosi, was formed, which was then baptized under the name Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you design or shape the song exactly like this?
Zs.B.: The number has been in an instrumental version for a long time, and then when the disk was assembled, we thought there was something more to do with this number.
The chord was attracted to my singing voice.
I was singing the song that the girls later learned.
It almost came first and scaryly spontaneously.
I remember he was very excited at the time, but of course, he needed the Divas.
It wouldn't have worked so hard with my voice.
Hvg.hu: Both on the disc and at the concert seemed to be behind the girls.
There is no solo (except Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they're all singing together and they're not louder than music, so music is not just accompanying their singing.
They were on the stage too.
Is that purposeful?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the back was just because of technical problems.
But it's clear that we didn't want to share solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting our ego, where it came from, where it comes from, just let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
Hvg.hu: What was the most work with?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the musical creatives, rather, were difficult to mix.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play a race zone, or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time he didn't want to work on the groove, then slowly stood everything in place like a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number for the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concert and by letting go of the disc.
Now the Prophet Is The Foot, the Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The traitor has risked billions of dollars because of a small sense of proportion.
It's a bad scream.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French Sociée Genérale bankor, calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Kerviel lost nearly five billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel is not talented at all, rather, just a big player who wants to follow his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he quickly recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market.
“It’s reduced spiritual ability,” he said to the police from his notifying superiors.
However, as the French Le Monde reported, Kerviel's testimony shows that he gained €1.6 billion from his business at the end of the last year.
Crisis not only in America
\"I just wanted to make money for my bank,\" he said.
In summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros in the US crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there have been news that there will be problems with the low-income, or with the so-called sub-prime mortgage provided to customers struggling with cancellation problems in the past.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe in this and did a good horse.
The final profit of the year reached EUR 1.6 billion.
“When I was looking for the first half billion, I didn’t know how to report it,” Kerviel admits and adds that he didn’t keep anything for himself.
In his testimony, he admits that he has forged his reports in such a way that it cannot be discovered.
Even when the Eurex Stock Exchange is interested in its operations.
The risk was a profit
Are you afraid to find out everything?
I'd rather not.
“I thought it was just the fact that I was looking for 1.6 billion for the bank, it calms them down.”
How did you have the power to risk that much?
His position gradually reached.
After completing the University of Lyon, he worked at the Socié Générale bank from 2000.
His annual salary moved around $51,000.
Two years later, he was a broker and became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000 in 2005.
However, he knew he would never look as much as others.
“In 2005, I knew that they were looking at me with bad eyes.
As a result of my skills, my professional and personal development, Kerviel told the detectives.
Not long after you entered, the first great success came.
Thanks to Allianz's shares, he made half a billion euros to fall in these shares during the bombings in London.
And it started a lavina - he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
\"This is like snowball,\" he told the police.
But his chiefs were supposed to know everything, or they'd rather guess it.
“When I was making money, I lost my eyes.”
But there was a blow at the beginning of the year.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
He was going to take a shower in mid-January.
When he went to work on Monday, he stopped working at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that he lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they find out?
He became suspicious of his freedom.
“I only took four days in the last year.
The broker who has no freedom is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to be able to look into his reports,” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic’s 365 billion dollars
Ministers of the Czech government signed nine operational programmes with the representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic could make 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
It is about half of the total amount obtained by the Czech Republic from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
In the regions, around 125 billion crowns are spent on seven operational programmes.
Czech companies can earn around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation program.
Most of the money, 150 billion crowns, is for transport.
The Transport Programme represents the largest operational programme and 22% of the funds available for the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state base of the Transport Infrastructure, which will be managed next year by the $90.8 billion crown.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to gain tools for innovation enterprises.
Companies should also obtain resources for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but more efficient methods of organisation.
In order to win the EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the least successful in the new countries.
The ex-President of Nicaragua approved the 20-year prison sentence of the court
On Thursday, the Nicaragua Appeal Court approved a 20-year prison sentence for Arnold Aleman, the former president of the country, for which $100 million was sentenced in 2003 (the almost 1.8 billion crown) for financial fraud.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in domestic custody in his hacienda near the capital.
Whether the former leader of this Central American country from 1997 to 2002 will return behind the grids, according to the AP news agency, it is not yet clear.
According to the President of the Appeal Court, Ileana Perez, it will depend on the prison administration to let Aleman be released at home or to go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alemán that it regularly referred to foreign companies’ accounts in Panama.
These fictional companies and their accounts were in reality relatives and nearest supporters.
He then made some of these funds at the Foundation, which was founded on the funding of Aleman’s 2001 election campaign.
They approved our budget.
That's right.
They accepted the state budget.
Why is this budget special?
This is the budget of the first non-responsibly adopted by the coalition majority of these governments.
This year, last year, this year was supported by the Social Democrats, since Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not afford to accept.
Unlike the lack of confidence in the government before the vote, there was no drama this time.
The House of Representatives has accepted this, although the most influential law.
This is a certain contradiction.
All governance begins and ends at each chapter and item of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but behind the struggles of government and opposition.
This is more grateful in the press, so you get a lot more attention in the media.
The debates of politicians are much more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The state budgets of the recent Social Democratic Governments have suffered three shortcomings, which the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
The first of them is the high proportion of the law on compulsory, so-called client spending, which means not only pensions, but also social benefits, which last year are approved before the elections by the silent coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the result of the first deficiency of the deficit management.
The third limit is the deficits of public finance, i.e. the budgets of cities and villages.
However, the highest risk is not the definition of the state budget.
This is under public and relative control.
The time bomb is the definitions of the budget for cities and flights.
Many mayors can also make money for other investments than tax, tax and bank loans, and have often issued bonds with which their city houses have been disproportionate.
In recent years, these debts have been paid off by massive sales of shares in the energy and other distribution networks that have been received from the state from privatizations.
They no longer have such a source.
If we rely only on official and controlled facts, it is concluded that:
For a few years now, the Czech Social Democratic Party has been going through a growth phase similar to the rest of the world, which continues to praise the Czech Socialist Party.
This was a unique opportunity for governments to put public funding in place.
Instead, the country has increasingly been brought into debt.
The rest of the countries have managed in a more reasonable manner than Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt.
This is, in particular, a huge shame for previous governments.
We belong to countries that are least threatened by poverty in global standards.
For example, there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have become completely unnecessary in recent years.
Although this year we have managed to eliminate part of the meaningless population expenditure approved before the elections, even if there will be no end to retirement and pension reform in the near future, any policy will actually end in this country, and whoever is to govern, this will be just an appointment.
With a little overstate, the majority of the money taxed from the governor politicians are usually retired and social benefits become mechanical distributors.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the reduction of normal spending by ordering expenditure.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be entirely unnecessary if the previous governments had not implemented everything that could have been done in the last decade.
If we do not really want to be made to become merely government officials, then we need to be patient and calm in order to prepare further reform laws for this not too strong, with an understanding of the coalition government that the state will only give out as much as it can obtain from taxes and taxes.
Only these will allow for a gradual achievement of a balanced budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The central banks of the US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to jointly fight the financial market crisis.
Money markets are costing hundreds of billions more than $100 billion through the stock exchange.
On this stock exchange, the bank will raise interest rates, for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will put forty billion dollars on the stock market and make another twenty-four available to the Central Bank of Europe and Switzerland.
After the attacks on the 11th of September, it is first that the central banks of each country have agreed to a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step should solve the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl wrote in his report to his clients from the Economic Outlook Group advisory company.
“The coordinated action of central banks in the United States has reduced the likelihood of recession from 65% to about 50 percent,” Baumohl said.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in non-refundable loans in the United States.
Analysts are expected to lose billions more.
“The central banks can really be afraid of what might happen if they decided on such a procedure,” said Kieran Davies, the general public economist of ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really bad,\" he added.
Central banks are afraid that if banks themselves can access loans hard, they will also lend more expensive loans to their customers.
This would reduce the need and reduce the US economy to recession with the potential consequences of global economic growth.
The central banks decided not to succeed in reducing the interbank rate of LIBOR, which is used in the interbank market for cash lending.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of mutual money lending, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain had reduced their interest rates a few times in the autumn.
“This will have a similar effect on the further drop in interest rates,” said Greg Salvaggio, the Reuters news agency, from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the steps taken by central banks contribute to the resolution of the crisis, as it does not solve the underlying problem, the fall of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The incredible debates of ecologists
Global climate change is most likely to threaten developing countries.
President Viktor Václav once again expressed his opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time, the UN Conference on Climate Change in Bali was critical.
The book Blue in Vienna, not the green planet, said that the discussions of ecologists were incredible.
Klaus said that not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which is a special mix of representatives of governments and civil society organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality that accompany it.
“The debate there is absolutely without the structure, it’s just a word throw, which is a substitute for the solution to the current problems,” Klaus said.
During the presentation of the Czech President's book, he stressed that it was very important to him and that he was so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction that the book would appear in German translation, because, as he said, “I will often meet with the charicatures of my opinion.”
Therefore, the interested parties can read their undistorted opinion.
Klaus reminded me that although he is not a climatologist, he considers that he has sufficient basic conditions to write such a book.
Because of the ability to monitor and evaluate professional presentations, he has also experienced as an academic in statistics and economists.
At the end of the book, he stated that climate changes are constantly changing, i.e. normal, and that there is no equivalent opinion on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of current changes are not too large and severe, so there is no danger and that efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
In addition, as a person with experience in totalitarianism, unproven opinions are considered unacceptable to others, which he perceives as a dangerous restriction of liberty.
He repeatedly explained on the questions of the present, “It is not against reasonable environmental protection, but against militant envirentalism, which does not take into account the link between costs and benefits.”
Klaus spoke about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people couldn't replace their licenses.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to replace their old license, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last time you can apply for the exchange that the offices can issue a new license in time by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will leave without valid rights.
The authorities say that the license was not replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While the walks mean a heavy fall of interest in the exchange of licences, the capital offices were flooded with applications for the exchange of licences for which this week’s interest was increased.
The Master’s Office receives around 2,000 customers a day.
It takes about half an hour to stand in line.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers did not replace the license.
The exhibition of a new license lasts 20 days.
However, the new licence may also be required with a shorter period of five days.
However, in such a case, the driver still needs to pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who are unable to make a compulsory exchange of licenses by the end of the year and are subject to an invalid licence will be subject to a penalty from January.
The offender must pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police can also settle the outage by agreement.
In the case of administrative exclusion, the penalty is 2500 crowns.
Based on previous information from the city hall, you can also get a fine who doesn’t travel anywhere.
You can also pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry previously called on the offices to be excused and imposed up to a thousand crowns of punishment.
According to the Transport Department spokesman Karel Hanselka, tens of thousands of fines do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the license is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
This is not a personal certificate that should be valid for everyone.
Those who don't want to drive anymore should cancel the license.
Enough to take it or recommend sending it to the appropriate office.
The licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers must gradually replace the other types of licence.
Those with documents between 1994 and 2000 can be replaced for a further three years.
The validity of the licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire only in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, it is about 2.6 million additional documents.
The court has reduced the punishment of Berdychel-collective investigators
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík were police officers suspected of being involved with David Bertych's criminal conspiracy, and were sentenced to thirteen and ten years of imprisonment.
The Supreme Court of Prague has determined that one of them has reduced their penalties for one and the other two years.
Originally, the investigators of the Prague Organizational Crime Division were threatened by 14 and 12 years of prison.
A review cannot be appealed against today's decision, only before the Supreme Court.
Although Bertychet is also suspected in this case, he expects only the first sentence.
In other proceedings, he has already received more than 16 years of punishment.
You can't get any more.
In January, the County Court found 19 people guilty of being involved in robbery attacks, of which 16 appeals were heard today by the Supreme Court.
The majority of the defendants refused the charges from the beginning of the investigation by the fact that it was a speculation case.
According to the Senate in Central Chechnya, the police members, in addition to the agreement with Bertyckel, have provided information about police sources, covered the attacks of each robbery and helped the gang avoid being forced into criminal responsibility.
The band has given up 30% of the robbery to Opava and Koňařík.
This is about the crimes of the band between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, it is a robbery whose victims have often suffered serious health damage, but also misuse of public authority and non-authorised arms retention.
Since the police found weapons, steel-sized ammunition, laser control or machine pistols illegally held during house research.
The band has accused him of stealing tens of millions of crowns with robbery.
In this case, a group of 20 members of the jury had already been found to be legally guilty of other robberys by Bertych and many others.
Further members of the Berdych environment will testify before the court even in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
To date, the first trial avoided Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulej, who are in pre-trial arrest in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their release to the Czech Republic for criminal proceedings.
Child exchange account: 12 million
For children who have been divorced, Igor Vele from the hospital in Třebíč requires 12 million crowns of pain plus court expenses.
The mothers have three million heads, two million fathers and one million children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dosztal, disagrees fundamentally with the proposal of Veleba.
“We reject this claim because it’s too much,” he said after today’s trial.
“In order to make an opinion on the motion for an objection, we need an expert opinion drawn up by the opponent.
We'll find out if there's any useful value at all.
But we maintain our opinion that this will be measurable for everyone in hundreds of thousands,\" Dostal said.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns each month until they raised their own biological girls.
Veleba served as the basis for the compensation negotiations, which was developed by the Motol University Hospital in Prague.
Children’s parents, according to psychologists and psychiatrists, suffered various degrees and depths of spiritual harm and stress.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even if they had met with such a miscarriage that they did not prevent the exchange of newborns.
Women cope worse with the actuality of the trauma experienced and what is happening right now, they put together the content of Him.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses in the birth of Třebíč on December 9.
Last week, children returned to their blood-related parents - Nikola Čermák in Přibyslavica, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloňov.
At the end of October, Vysočina’s travel manager Miloš Vystrčil gave families 100,000 crowns to replace their expenditures, which were caused by the failure of the hospital in Třebíčské, which was controlled by the walk.
All hospitals in Czech Republic have mandatory compensation from the law.
In case of misappropriation, they shall extend to the reserve base and may, exceptionally, request the assistance of the founder.
The courts have so far granted relatively low compensation to people, and the amounts have been calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand, in exceptional cases, of a few million crown tables.
Polík has lost the kingdom of Vášsko
Bolek Polízka lost his lawsuit for the title of the Kingdom of Vášsko.
According to the Ostravian court judge, although he used the name of King Valchi for the first time, the project was developed by a team around Tomáš Harabish, who collaborated with the painting.
Polish did not take part in the trial today.
However, according to a legal representative, the case will probably not end and the client will appeal.
“The debate is about Mr Harabish and his team living on the popularity of Bolek Políkka,” Polákka’s lawyer said after the lawsuit.
He said that in the words of the Kingdom of Valach, everyone comes into the mind of the actor-commic.
This opinion is also shared by Harabish.
“It’s almost ten years of work behind us.
Find money and figure out actions,\" he said.
He said the reason for the debate is money.
“In the past, they realized that the project was successful and could win something from it.
They want to live out of our work,\" he added.
Future business
According to the court, the name of King Valchi was first used by Polízka on television.
In 1993, Radoslav Brzobohatý was crowned.
At that time, however, this did not depend on the purpose of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of issuing his passports.
The original student csíny action became a business and profitable entrepreneurial activity, followed by Harabish based on the creation of a society of the Kingdom of Vášsko.
In 1997, with the declaration of Políka's consented name and signature in passports, and even their owners offered discounts when visiting their farm and theatre performances.
Who takes the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabish himself only used the idea, which Polízka had brought to the public for his business in Manesa.
“Boleslav Polík’s popularity has certainly helped the Valachi kingdom project,” the judge said.
However, he added that the spirit of the project was Harabish and his team.
The cooperation of today’s collaborators continued until 2000 when Harabish Polík organized formal co-ordination in Vsetín.
Since then, however, there have been controversy between Políkka and Harabish, which “was forever divided into the salvation of King Boleslav I.
In the kingdom, Harabish took over Jarmila Šulákov as a mother queen.
In 2002, Polish Harabish and his associates filed a court action against him, which was refused by the court today.
The battle planned by Harabish could bring light to the debate for the throne and half for the queen.
It should be a new king from this battle.
The details and the date have not yet been revealed.
“We don’t want to catch anything.
This should be something like the Slovacko Royalty.
The King should be elected for a fixed time.
Mr. Polík will be able to make an effort,\" Harabish added.
The 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot test: excellent prejudices
Honestly, I never liked Peugeot 206.
The quality of change, driving and production are often below the average.
But the current successor on the market, Peugeot 207 is significantly better.
And the combination called SW goes a lot further, so I have nothing left but to think more about it.
When I tested the Peugeot 207 classic sixchback, for example, I complained in the back seat to the place left on the head.
This time, the complaint is over, because the armour of the combo means that the two-metre giants are no longer suffering in this regard.
Fürgen in the World
I get through the interior quickly so I don't repeat myself many times.
This is a relatively successful design where my only excuse is for the poor console.
Here I would appreciate some more designer inventory, if the car’s appearance is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we were complaining about the short bottom of the seat or the bracelets.
The side management has also improved significantly compared to the 202 model.
As far as space is concerned, there is also an increase in the size of the body.
After that, the head disappears to a few places that have already been mentioned.
Leather bags in the trunk
The main thing about this vehicle is the package.
This is very well available (even thanks to the pull-out back window) and I need to appreciate it wide-ranging.
The empty places are equipped with handle tires, which are ideal compromises.
They are not in the way, they can be pulled out, and they can handle difficult things.
But let's just stay at the volume for a while.
Based on the tables, the fund is divided into 428 l, which is more than the average value of competition.
However, in the Czech Republic it is not the most sought-after vehicle of this class - the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation of the mladá boleslav, then we find that Peuge is far behind many 52 liters.
This value is almost critical when traveling abroad or placing a stroller on a stroller.
But if I have to highlight the positives, then I have to mention the almost totally straight floor after the second row's backs down or the very low threshold.
120 hovers in four rows
The vehicle we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder engine with a capacity of 1,6 l, 88 kW.
And telling the truth, that's how you should look like a thousand-six hundred who drive the family's sixchback.
It's quiet, small, and it's mainly drawn.
If we compare it to Škoda's suit, which often affects you as if you were filling a rag in your exhaust, then I can only be happy with it.
The price is rising.
The price of the car is not cheap.
However, we have to remember that we have tested a large interior and a car equipped with a very good engine.
The car leaves for 329 900 Kč with four cylinders.
The car starts with 410 990 Kč, which is already a lot.
The tested Premium equipment throws the equipment with an additional 8,000 Kč.
Just so we had our headbags, our automatic climate, our automatic window wiper launch, our back windows were electric remote control.
That means the car costs 531 900 Kč by wire.
This is a lot, but count the Fabia accessories and get a very similar result.
So there's nothing left but the brand's decision.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is unsuccessful
In British schools, there is an increasing number of children in Eastern Europe who are concerned about the further development of local school affairs.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is facing many obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases where disputes between the children of immigrants and domestic residents have become violent.
The problems related to the integration of children in Eastern Europe are well demonstrated by a case in the North East where the debate between their places and Slovak immigrants is increasing.
Disputes and ties between students are already characterized by the relationships of parents.
The situation got so far that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who told a 10-year-old student with a iron rod.
The sinner defends the boy from insulting him with racist secrets.
The police had to go after two twelve-year-old girls attacking the Slovak immigrants.
The girls said the man was barred with racist comments and thrown with stones.
“When we went home, a boy climbed to the bus stop and began to spit at us.
When I told him to stop with apples and nails and then reveal his naked back,” the mother of the Slovak students described the new unpleasant case for The Times.
Both sides have complaints.
One of the local residents identified debates on immigrants in Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above cases indicate that in British schools the mood between locals and immigrants is becoming tense.
In Britain, there are 70,000 jobs-seekers in Slovakia.
About 30,000 Slovak students go to British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is indeed the island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can be completed if you choose correctly.
The golden horse and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm as a bellow.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or marble cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean, you can find this in a full and richer list.
However, on one island you can find much more, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antiques.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was the bravery of its U.S. conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by human eyes.
Havanna became a treasure store and recharger, which the Spaniards kidnapped in America and transported to Europe.
The American era followed.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the U.S. mafia, built it, because everything that was thought to be a crime in the United States (mostly a ban), was welcomed in Cuba and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
For example, there were guests.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, towers were built, and cars became a symbol of the culture of the 50s of the last century on a wide range of roads.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his own yacht in Cojímar.
The walls of the Bodeguita del Medio are decorated by the signature of the stars and politicians of American showbusiness.
What about today?
You can also provide the wall of Bodeguita in Havana with your handheld.
A cocktail is presented to you in the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel.
And the cars of the 50s of cultus are still in Havana, because the once-exported flames and sons have long been destroyed in this salty and wet air.
Although the oldest part of Havana has been significantly degraded, there is no such beautiful colonial monument anywhere else in the area as there.
Other places are becoming more beautiful, like Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism provides the necessary money, its development has received a green path.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels were built not only in Havana, but also in Varader, on the coast of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba in the world offers a unique genome, which is primarily appreciated by train lovers.
From their extensive plantations, sugar cane was delivered to sugar plants by steam and motorcycling.
Their motor parks have not been renewed for decades, so the machines that work there are visible, whose peers are seen elsewhere only in museums.
Where should we go?
Most of Cuba's visitors do not miss the most well-known places.
It is not necessary to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps just remind me that there is a museum on the Hemingway birts, and that those who love the writer will not miss the visit to this museum.
One of the most colorful parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
The stupid vegetation is growing from the masonry.
Cemetery formations, herb-highs and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and in their valleys the fertile soil has grown up, which makes it a dense plant that covers the spreads.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can meet with a final form when visiting a factory in Havana.
Some might also find it interesting that Major Zeman's episode of Chile has been rotated there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the island colonization of Spain.
The trade in slavery and sugar has brought fame and glory.
The economy has filled the body in the beauty and monumentality of a non-great city.
The later French settlers had a significant impact on colonial Spanish architecture in nearly four centuries.
Trinidad between the Escambray plains and the sea is so far away that even in the 50s of the last century there were no roads that would have connected this region with the rest of the country.
Some isolation helped to stay outside.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't break down, everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon time for Trinidad, it’s worth watching the interesting places in the area like the Playa Ancón Beach or the Valley of Sugar Factory.
This evening it is appropriate to go to Casa de la Música, which, after dark, wakes you up, where the music will be quiet only in the morning.
Baracoa
Some of the cities in the east of Cuba are considered the most beautiful cities.
This opinion must have been influenced by the road itself.
Both roads from Guantanamo have to overcome high and structured mountains, and they are driven by almost barely affected nature by human activity.
Due to the inviolable nature of Cuba, UNESCO has included Cuba in the World Heritage List.
Here is the best chocolate in the church, with Columbus cross (in reality made after the cruise of Columbus hundreds of years) and the hill where the former castle stood and today it stands in the El Castillo hotel, some of which are the most well-known of El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Meastro plains, the Gulf of Disnó and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabare, the Caridad del Cobra Cuban Patronus, the Santeria, the African religion, which the successors of former slaves, can be written a lot of.
As they say correctly, it is better to see once.
The Afghan Allies are passive, states the Americans
There are also few soldiers and lack of equipment to influence the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.
According to Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should outline concrete plans for the next few years.
The Afghan mission is not thought to be happening, the leaders of the countries that have agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, with units in the southern part of the country.
In addition to increasing resistance to the Taliban movement, eight participating countries also consult on further plans and coordination of allies.
While the US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called on NATO troops to be more active this week, Britain considers strengthening the Afghan government and strengthening development aid to be a priority.
“The development of Afghanistan is tangible, but the military force can only be part of the solution.
The other one allows the public to start the further development of the economy and security themselves,\" he told the BBC, British Secretary of Defense Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels, according to the U.S. government, has been the strongest in the last five years.
The number of acts of violence increased by 27% compared to last year and 60 percent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO has about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, roughly one quarter of them in southern areas.
However, according to the United States, the Allies have reached their borders in the organisation and equipment of the teams.
In particular, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts were asked to train Afghan troops.
“We have to think carefully about the specific goals for the future and the methods for achieving them, řekl Gates.
Jaap de Hoop, the Secretary-General of NATO, spoke in a similar spirit today.
“I am not happy about what is in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment that we need, and this is little,” De Hoop told the Reuters news agency at the end of the three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There have also been discussions among the participating countries over the past few months on whether all allies offer maximum levels in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passivity.
“The Germans are relatively large in Afghanistan.
However, they were introduced in areas where the least violence and combat requirements are so not as high as against them as against us in the southern and eastern parts of the country,\" Gates said.
This week, the Sun British bullboard called German soldiers lazy.
“Afghan historians have discovered that the Germans play while our boys fight,” Sun wrote in a material supplemented by a photograph of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild attacked and published a photograph of a British team of rögbimecs in the south of Afghanistan.
Government debt will reach the one trillion in 2009
Each of the Czechs has 84,000 crowns of state debt.
By the end of September, the total debt reached $842.7 billion.
The government plans to take a loan of $159.2 billion this year.
By the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced this plan by $123.8 billion as a result of the better development of the state budget.
At the end of September, the Czech Republic's state debt reached 842.7 billion crowns.
During the nine months of this year, this rose by 40.2 billion crowns.
From June, however, he fell by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance has so far verified the state debt data from the beginning of October.
Each of the Czechs has more debt than 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the state paid more than 11 billion crowns.
“For now, it seems that the lower deficit of the next year will only go beyond the one billion crown limits in 2009.
In the next year, the debt will move around the 900 billion and a trillion crown,” said Patria Finance analyst David Marek, the iHNed.cz server.
Similarly, you can see this Next Finance Analyzer, Vladimir Pikora: “In 2009 we can move through a trillion.
When exactly, it depends on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it were to prove that the situation would change in the field of politics, politicians would be willing to hide more, it would be possible to hide until 2010.
But I don't assume that change,\" he said.
Increasing Debts
State debt is the debt of the central government, mainly through the accumulation of government deficits.
State debt is financed with bonds, public loans, direct loans, or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroons this year.
The country's foreign debt has increased by 1.7 billion kronas to 123.3 billion.
By the end of September, the so-called state debt reached $803.3 billion and decreased from June to 13.7 billion.
The average period of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
“The total year-on-year debt increased by 13% in the first quarter, which is really much compared to the progress of the economy.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated in loan bonds, where the increase is 20%.
It’s bad that debt is increasing, but on the other hand, it shows what it will be like to trade when the pension reform comes here,\" Pikora said.
Better than expected
The funding strategy and the management of the state debt in 2007 show that the government planned to take a loan of $159.2 billion this year.
By the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan by $123.8 billion, thanks to the better development of the state budget.
The amount is mainly the definition of the state budget, which is likely to reach the 76 billion crowns instead of the assumed 91.3 billion crown this year.
Furthermore, the Czech Consolidation Agency has planned a maximum of 13.3 billion kronas, ten billion reserve for pensions, 43 billion kroons for public loans and 1.8 billion krona loans from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher is present today in front of a court of Cartoon because of the name given to a pyssmack.
On Thursday night, a cartel court sentenced the British teacher to 15 days in prison and expulsion from the country due to the violation of Islam in Sudan, his lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her 6-7-year-old students to name a plus-year-old mask as Mohammed. However, Islam’s religion prohibits any representation of his prophet.
Such action is punishable by a stroke.
The 54-year-old British woman, who was a teacher at Unity High School, was arrested at her own home on Sunday. According to paragraph 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, was accused of violating and revolting Islam after the students’ parents complained several times at the Ministry of Education in Sudan.
The story began in September, when the teacher asked her 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the class's bust.
\"The children proposed eight names: including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,\" says Robert Boulos, the school director.
In the end, 20 of the 23 children elected Muhammad.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the prophet of Islam, but also a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a common diary with the photograph of the bear and “My name is Mohammed.”
The problem lies in the fact that any representation of the prophet is a violation of Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues who taught at the same school, Gillian Gibbons, said that he knew him well, and that the teacher would never have done anything that would violate any religious conviction.
Many students agree with this opinion. In our opinion, the teacher is “very well treated with the children, and never speaks of religion in the class.”
Remember that Muhammad is also the second most popular crossword in Britain, and there are 14 different ways of writing in English.
This is a way of expressing respect for the prophet so many times chosen by Muslim families. (The name is given to the first-born child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of the crosswords?
Can you get this name, for example, in a game?
This is obviously a question of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last Vienna conference on Wednesday.
End result: failure.
The last meeting between the Serbians and the Kosovo Albanians on the future status of the Separatist Province has ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
\"It is unfortunate that the parties have not reached an agreement on status,\" Mr Ischinger said at a Vienna press conference.
The U.S. Ambassador Frank Wisner stressed that peace in the region was at stake, and encouraged Belgrade and Pristina to continue their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the negotiations.
“It is not necessary to avoid violence in the near future, but it is a very difficult period,” he said, stressing the existence of “obvious tensions.”
Mediation ends on 10 December
Last visit to Serbia and Kosovo on Monday is an intermediary troika involving the European Union, the United States and Russia.
The future of the Albanian province can be clarified in 90% after Ischinger, Wisconsin and Russian mediator, Aleksandr Bocan-Harchenko submits his report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The debate near Vienna, Baden, has announced the sixth and final meeting of the negotiations since the UN launched a new broadcast in August last year.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation task will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians who have already denied the independence of Kosovo in the Security Council will insist that negotiations will continue after the deadline has expired.
\"Russia was committed and remains the negotiated solution, alongside the compromise,\" Bocan-Harchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under the control of the UN for 8 years, Western powers believe that independence under the supervision of the EU is the only viable solution.
Pristina stated that she was willing to make a unilateral declaration of independence if the Security Council did not decide for her benefit.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
“We have not been able to reach an agreement,” said Fatmir Sejdiu, president of the Kosovo independent province, at the Baden hotel where we have been in negotiations for the last chance since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo Uprising and future prime minister of the province, also expressed his regret.
He added, however, that the idea of Belgrade’s autonomy would be “a continuation of the past of murders and deportations.”
\"Domino Effect \"
The Serbian President, Mr Tadic, believed that the compromise was still possible, and the majority in Kosovo warned about the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade is still in an unstable area because of the wars of independence in the 1990s.
“For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of compromise,” Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation again stated that the decision would only be the Security Council, where the Russian ally had veto rights.
“The last word will be the Parliament of Kosovo.”
\"For Serbia, only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable,\" the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“The negotiations have been held for two years.
They must end where they started: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu said to journalists that “the Kosovo Parliament would be the last word,” he added that independence on behalf of the Albanians would be a unilateral exclamation based on the Western powers.
Bush calls for an agreement between Israel and Palestine
On Tuesday, President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israel and Palestine finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed to immediately enter into negotiations between their peoples in order to finalise a 60-year debate.
Bush, in the presence of the two presidents, promised to support them in all possible ways in order to sign the Peace Agreement in 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians have to cut off the \"terrorist networks\", and Israel has to abandon its colonial activity, Bush said, and recalled the two parties to their obligations in connection with the \"peace plan\" adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the purpose of the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, led by Abbas, was to sign a peace treaty to resolve all pending problems, including central issues.
The latter concern the three delicate problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees from their homes during the 1948 conflict, who lived in the territory of today’s Israeli state.
Abbas, who spoke after the President of the United States, said that the future negotiations would be “global and profound” and that they would touch all areas of regulation, such as “Jehovah, asylum, borders, colonies, water and security.”
After that, Olmert, on the rise, promised that the future negotiations would be “necessary and continuous,” and he will strive to “be completed in 2008”
By the end of 2008 Bush set out the implementation of the Palestinian and Israeli \"the vision of two states\".
Saudi Arabia said Bush had been promised to do so before deciding to take part in the conference.
Saudi Arabia (which was a success in Washington) initiated a plan to secure peace for Israel in exchange for all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is the answer to the history of the Central East, especially because it captures the problem at the root and focuses on central issues – says the Saudi prince in his interview with the Saudi-owned Arab daily.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As usual for such news, the official position and speech contradict each other.
How was the accident?
According to the first data of the investigation launched by the National Police Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car went on the Louise-Michel street in Villiers-le-Bel a few minutes after 17 hours.
“The car was patrolling, so it wasn’t involved in the operation. It was 40-50 km/hour at a speed without sirens,” we learned from a police source.
The two without helmets were driven by a green engine that was not in the official register and therefore cannot be used in road traffic (see below) with Kawasaki brand.
“As they did not comply with the right-hand rule, the engine was hit by the left side of the police car,” says a police officer.
The result of the alcohol test on the passengers of the vehicle was negative.
It clearly shows the strength of the collision that the front of the car was anchored, the windshielded in the form of the windshield, and the bumper came down.
Pontoise’s State Attorney, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced yesterday morning that IGPN and Val-D’Oise County Department of Public Security were entrusted with the investigation, which was initiated “in response to the failure to commit murder and assistance from negligence.”
During the afternoon, the prosecutor said at a press conference that the responsibility of the police can be excluded at the current stage of the investigation of IGPN.
According to the prosecutor, the accident confirmed the police report that the scooter arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car.
On the day of yesterday, one of the stripes, undoubtedly drawn by the pedestrians on the road, showed that the two vehicles collapsed and went together for a while until the police car had failed to shut down.
Vehicles are reserved for technical testing purposes.
The body of the two victims was undergoing a medical examination yesterday.
What happened right after that?
There was a rumor in Villiers-le-Bel yesterday that the police quickly left the site without the help of the two young people.
In this regard, IGPN is cautious, but excludes the police from making “any serious mistake.”
“This is the hardest part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation and increased caution during this investigation,” we learned from a police source.
The Libération met a witness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of his residence is exactly where he looks.
“My cousin, who is a nurse at the hospital, immediately went down to try to revitalize them,” the witness said.
“We couldn’t do anything yet.”
Then he noticed “a police officer who was completely disturbed and upset.
The other two tried to revive one of the young people, and the fourth called,
Among those present, tension has increased, as the two young people’s hopeless situation has become apparent, so the arrival police have carried their colleagues away by car from the site.
Also, we know from the witness’s statement that the ambulance arrived about 20 minutes after the police left.
Heart massage was also used, but in vain.
“I wouldn’t say the police didn’t try to help young people.
The young people were given help.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
They did everything they could to save them,\" the prosecutor stressed.
The tension in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police prevented the first protests of the state of emergency introduced by General Musarraf two days earlier.
According to witnesses, about 2,000 lawyers in Lahore, the eastern part of the country, protesting the measures taken in the state of emergency, were wounded by the tear gas bombs used by law enforcement forces.
In response, they threw stones at the police, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were produced.
Similar events took place in Karachi and Rawapindi, where the police attacked the lawyers and wounded them.
Several people were produced.
In Islam, lawyers registered by the Supreme Court called for general strikes and protests were reported due to the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighter and lawyer during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
There were several protests in the central part of the country in Multin and in the Northwest Peshawar.
Since Monday, the movement of lawyers has been supported by the massive alliance of Dehida Majlis-e-Amal, which is compressing religious parties. He has encouraged the people “to send flowers to the judges who disagree with the condition of need, and a trash to those who have sworn before Musarraf.
“Musarraf’s promise is no longer valid.”
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the coming days, the Court should state the legality of the re-election of President Musarraf on 6 October, with an indirect vote.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed from office and has been replaced by another.
“All that we have witnessed is illegal, unlawful and contrary to the judgments of the Supreme Court,” the president said to the newspaper The News.
President Pervez Musarraf promised that he would leave the army to fulfil his role as President of the Civil Service, after the introduction of the state of emergency, “has lost power,” said Tariq Azem, Deputy Minister of Information.
By 15 November, Musarraf had to withdraw his first presidential mandate from the military uniform until the end.
The Minister of Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government, by the way, condemned the country-wide rumor that President Musarraf would have been appointed as the Deputy General.
More than one-third of pregnancy is not planned
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unplanned pregnancies.
Even today, more than one-third of pregnancy (36%) has not been planned - a study by the French National Institute of Demographics (Ined) found forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act that liberalises contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unplanned pregnancies.
According to Ined, different methods of contraception, such as tablet or bee spiral, are still failing in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the Institute, the liberalization of contraception has made it more effective than birth control – the study notes that only 5% of women aged 20 to 44 have taken birth control pills in 1970, but this rate is now 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancys are scheduled.

Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work in space for more than seven hours to perform the spectacular improvement of the station's unsuspected solar panel.
This dangerous spacecraft has proved to be a record in many respects: repairs took a very long time to plan, and there was very little time to do it, away from living modules, with spacecraft-barked tools.
The problem occurred Tuesday when the astronauts chose the Harmony module from Discovery. This is a huge cylinder element that will soon be the location of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see the framed part).
This module is a type of gateway to laboratory modules.
However, it is necessary to take care of their electricity supply.
The second task of the crew was therefore to transfer one module producing electricity from the 17.5 tons solar panels to the final location of the ISS.
After that, the crew began to open the module's 76 meters wide solar panels.
At that time, one of the harmoniously foldable tables was damaged by a cable in about 1 meter length.
In order to avoid further injury, the board was not opened.
The mission of the astronauts was originally to take control of the Discovery spacecraft and then repair another solar panel with a failed rotation system. Instead, they had to devote their entire time to repair the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to perform the scene hanging on a 30-meter robot arm attached to the spacecraft's crane.
He's one of NASA's best \"storage walkers\"
High, strong, extremely clever, muscular with upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old doctor, therefore, had to “operate” the “damaged” solar panel.
After carefully examining the damage caused, he cut the faulty cable and recorded the damaged area with a few “saints.”
In his monks, he also helped another “space walker” who remained near the safe passage and from inside the other astronauts, including the crew captain, Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockeybot, which was used to isolate hundreds of volts of solar panels, the spacecrafts of the station cut out and “barked” together.
After the operation was carried out, Scott Parazynski waited until his colleagues opened the table completely, and only then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts had a half-day rest, and today the Discovery space chlorine returned to begin the trip home planned for Wednesday.
Reduce the exchange rate of EADS shares
The exchange rate of EADS shares was high on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the company manufacturing aircraft and protective equipment announced that the delay in the development of the A400M aircraft would result in an additional cost of EUR 1.2-1.4 billion.
The exchange rate of EADS shares is currently EUR 21.96 after a reduction of 4%.
The company was forced to review its 2007 operating performance forecasts because the development of the A400M engine is delayed, which is why the aircraft's landing is likely to be delayed.
The delay in the transfer of the fighter carrier's aircraft, announced in October, will cost between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion, more than 1 billion of which affects Airbus,\" said the parent company of the European EADS manufacturing company.
Due to the emergence of these expenditures, EADS will have to report new plans for its operating result in 2007 on Thursday, when it will report quarterly results, the company added but did not report any further figures.
The group also indicated that the six-month delay was taken into account when preparing the new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS’s operating result decreased by 86%: this was largely due to a delay in the development of another program, the A380 giant machine, which also has a high financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to transfer A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Leave a status quo
They do not promise a big surprise to Sunday elections: the majority of Russians will vote for the party of Prime Minister Putin, the One Russia.
In this regard, the Russians' need for stability, to say, is shown after a powerfully manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin speaks in a television message through public service channels to voters, which have already been recorded, but the content is still secret.
Putin is the leader of the Kremlt Support Party, the candidate list of the Single Russia, which is expected to win a overwhelming victory in the elections.
At the reception of foreign ambassadors yesterday, the conduct of the Head of State did not tell us anything: he only took another run against the interventions of Western countries, which was a popular topic in the campaign.
“We know what the price is for true democracy, so we want honest, absolute transparent and open choices without any kind of infringement,” he added.
However, the opposition says that this is not the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign in which they believe they have put pressure on the voters.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gen Nagyij Zjuganov, said: “It was not even a dirty choice in Russia in the days of Jelcin.”
After the bombing of the last weekend protests, the former chess champion Garri Kasparov was sentenced to five days in prison for unlicensed protests, and his lawyer said he could still not be visited.
“The Russians still think of ‘homo as a lasseticus’.”
The predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
- Who's following Putin in the head of state?
The first round of the presidential election was published yesterday in the Official Journal, which will be 2 March 2008, and the candidates will be able to indicate their intention of starting until 23 December 2008.
Since Vladimir Putint was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate can no longer be extended.
There is no other successor on the horizon.
What role does Putin play from March?
Is he going to be a prime minister?
Or will he decide on the government and the president as the leader of the Almighty Unity Russia and the majority of Parliament?
No matter what happens, leaving power is won by both parliament and presidential elections.
This has now become an onion.
“The Russians are still thinking of a “homo auuticus”: they don’t feel that they can control their destiny,” Lev Gudkov said.
Koposov, the historian of the University of St. Petersburg, goes even further: according to his theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later compared to Europe, so the development of civil society is delayed. The traditional social spirit hampered the development of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putyin went back to the Paternist model, which was perfect for the people. He also gave it, as this new type of Paternalism did not go with fear, but with certain economic prosperity – Maria Lipman, a colleague of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “reject personal responsibility from their own,” which was quickly shown after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
\"Why should we think about it?\"
The phenomenon affects all layers of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite was interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of the Single Russia are led by 65 governors, who are the leaders of the 85 Russian region.
The freedom imported from the West often embodies chaos, as was the case in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extremist parties.
Tamara Cseredniken, a 54-year-old teacher, said: “Why should we think?
Those in power are not so bad why we should replace them.
Pressive memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive has become public, documenting the fate of 17 and half million victims of the Hitlerian regime.
The 47 million archive documents, which occupy 27 kilometres of pollors in Bad Arolsen, in the province of Hessen, have so far been researched only for “humanity” purposes, i.e. only a unique and name-specific overview of the victims or descendants of Hajdan.
In May 2006, eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to open the archive to researchers and historians.
After each state ratified the convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Reliable information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen Library allows historians to carry out research on the transfer of prisoners, the residents of camps and the state of health of forced labour, explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive managed by the Red Cross International Commission.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the publication of documents, as they also contain names and confidential information.
For example, some deported victims may be suspected of homosexuality or mental disability.
The lists of concentration camps and the arrest orders issued by Gestapo began to be collected for practical reasons after the war. The aim was to investigate civilians who were deported or convicted of forced labour, and possibly serve with evidence of their intimidation on the basis of which they could be compensated.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent workers are currently engaged in the processing of tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, a part of the scientific community does not consider it important to open the Bad Arolsen archive.
“These documents contain basically nothing new,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Berlin University Center of Technology’s Center for Anti-Semitism in 2006.
The EU-India Free Trade Convention was signed in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade is now approaching EUR 60 billion on an annual basis.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the Free Trade Convention in 2008 - European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Minister of Commerce Kamal Nath.
The EU Foreign Ministers have already approved in April that the European Commission will launch negotiations on the signing of free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asia Nations (ASEAN). The annual turnover of inter-European bilateral trade is now approaching EUR 60 billion.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also India’s main foreign investor, but India is only the 9th most important trading partner of the EU, according to the European Commission’s figures.
Peter Mandelson explained that \"a free trade agreement for both parties could be economical, and \"India could thus increase its presence in a market of 450 million inhabitants\".
The 10 most important products exported by India are Europe’s primary or secondary importers – the European Commissioner. Every year, two giants, Europe and Asia have exchanged EUR 47 billion – and €10 billion of services – – with each other – announced Danière Smadja, the head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi. At the same time, he expressed his regret that the bilateral trade – still has not achieved its full potential – in the EU and India on Friday, New Delhi, will meet in the eighth diplomatic summit in Manmohan Singh and José Durao Barroso, the President of the European Commission.

Answer to concerns: Bank of England offers £10 billion to the financial market for five weeks
The Bank of England wants to alleviate the unrest on credit conditions, so on Thursday it announced that it would pump £10 billion to the money market, which is made available with a 57.5% base interest rate and five weeks of maturity this time, unlike usual.
“We want to resolve concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we would also like banks to plan their liquidity position more safely for this period. Therefore, a significant part of the Bank’s reserves will be offered in the framework of an open market operation of a five-week operation on the international financial market, the bank’s press release.
According to the bank, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December, local time at 12:15 p.m. The bid will be valid for the central bank, and the repayment period will be 10 January.
This is the first time that the Bank of England will issue liquid funds for five weeks in the framework of an open market operation.
The date of such operations is usually one week.
In its press release, the Bank of England added that, in order to take further measures, interbank loans should be adapted to the central bank.
The current interbank rate was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate exceeded the level of 18 September: it currently stands at 6.6%.
Since the start of the summer money market crisis, the Bank of England has calculated a significant penalty interest on the amounts pumped into the money market, which has deterred banks from taking them back.
According to the rumor, (which only strengthens the development of the exchange rate of the pound compared to the euro) many would have been more pleased with the resources offered by the European Central Bank, with a more favourable interest rate and greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group closed on Thursday the discussion of socialist legislation on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text itself.
The text discussed at the socialist meeting included about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the National Office of the Socialist Party. These included, for example, a 50% increase in employment compensation, a return of variable fuel tax, the introduction of a travel check and the restriction of rental fees.
Since the UMP and NC 180:115 voted against the examination of the articles, the discussion of the government party and opposition finally broke up with a sharp change of speech. This was only a few hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy’s speech on the purchase of television.
The Head of the Socialist Delegation, Jean-Marc Aylault, announced that he would resubmit all his proposals in the context of the amendment of the corrective financial bill, which will be on the agenda of the National Assembly next week.
A New Festival is Born
A number of speeches were held in relation to the new Philadelphia music festival to be held by C3 Present. However, now the organization and promotion company announced that the Vineland Music Festival will be held in cooperation with Melvin Benn's British producer, the Festival Republic.
“It is an honor for us to be able to work with someone who is the founder of today’s American festival movement,” said Charlie Jones of C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 also organizes the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The Vineland festival in New Jersey will be held in the summer, so there will be a way to take a tent.
Between 8 August and 10 August, the festival will be held in a 500-wave private area of about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Melvin Benn, director of the Festival Republic, previously known as Mean Fidddler, is one of the world’s greatest festivals.
In 1989, he began organising the British Reading Festival, which attracts about 80 000 visitors every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn continued to expand his selection with the Leeds Festival, and in 2006, he called the Festival Republic to live in the Latitude Festival at the Suffolki Henham Park.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival’s production, license management and organisation tasks. This festival has been able to accommodate up to 177 500 people by now.
C3 staff Charlie Jones called the Glastonbury Festival “the most inspiring event,” which he has ever attended. He added that his company and Melvin Benn’s company work in parallel to enriching the region with a European-style festival.
“We’ve chosen the Philadelphia site before, and together with the Fairmount Parks Committee we worked hard to organize this festival in the centre of Philadelphia,” Charlie Jones said.
“We have continued to negotiate with the city, and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, because of the political leaders of the city, the organization failed, Charlie Jones continued.
“We have been able to talk about this with Melvin Benn, and now we are preparing to organize a huge festival on another unique site, which ultimately serves the interests of the people of Philadelphia.”
The C3 Presents re-elevated the Lollapalooza festival at Grant Park in Chicago in 2005, after having proven its exceptional talent for festival organizers in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The gross revenue of the two events in 2007 was 9.8 million and 11.3 million dollars.
Both festivals were held at the city centre.
“Melvin Benn’s European concept is based on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas,” Charlie Jones said.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way and create both a European rural mood and a common sense of life in the United States.
Vineland is located in Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The population of Vineland, and even the mayor himself, strongly support the event,” Charlie Jones said.
Although he does not discuss the details of the agreement, he says that “the conditions are favourable enough to allow an investment in an event such as this in a place that will hopefully give home for a long time to the festival.”
According to Charlie Jones, the festival’s “orienteering” capacity will be roughly equivalent to the 80 000-person capacity of the Bonnaro Music Festival in Tennessee.
The teams have already received the invitation to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
“Vineland will basically be a rock festival, but we are planning a variety of music offerings so that everyone can find their pleasure in it,” Charlie Jones said.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles At, together, form the C3 company, which received the recognition of the “best independent event organizer” in the last Billboard Touring Award.
Montreal confronts the Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to fight with the Terminator...
“Fatherment” is one of the tasks of the Montreal.
The mission is \"politically difficult\", as California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes the rotation of his own productions abroad.
It’s really hard to fight “Terminator Governor”
“We need to be careful because the film industry itself decides which place is the best place for us.
If you find that the conditions are favourable in Montreal, you will go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions for us to decide on,” Schwarzenegger said.
Competition for the festivals
Denis Turcotte, however, is now the most focused on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for Oscars started.
The aim is to present and promote as many of the Quebec films as possible at every American film festival, whether the Sundance Film Festival or the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
The film L'Âge des ténèbres was welcomed a few weeks ago at the Mill Valley Film Festival.
The Palm Springs International Festival will also be held in January.
Shakespeare Hands with the Devil is also featured in Santa Monica, as well as at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Québec also represented himself with four short films and four play movies this month at the American Film Institute Festival.
Will you be the end of the year rally on the stock exchange? The expert's opinion is shared by the \"subprime\" crisis
Less than five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors have already rubbed their hands and are looking forward to the end of the normal year.
This year, however, it is not clear to experts whether this will really happen.
According to Banif, “from a statistical point of view, the stock exchange generally behaves positively in December.
However, only statistical projections are not necessarily correct, and even uncertainty in the current situation is characterized by market uncertainty, at least in the short term.
Experts do not agree with the end of the year of the stock exchange, although it is stated that “the stock market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, this gives an opportunity to invest, as there are no guarantee alternatives, especially the fixed yield that negatively affects the return to quality securities, as long as in the short term.
For this reason, the stock exchange will be characterised by a side-directed, no volatility-free movement, especially since it is not yet known with the effect of the Fed-camtop reduction, the price of crude oil is also high and is also threatening the inflationary tension.
Javier Barrio, the sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees with this, i.e. it would be risky to declare that there would be a rally.
According to the expert, “the situation is not usually rose.”
The loss of Ibex is almost 4 percent compared to the highest values recorded on 8 November when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
Despite all this, not all experts are so horrid.
Juan Solana, an analyst at InterMoney, says that Ibex 35 can close the year closer to 16.000 points due to the reorganization of wallets and payments to the usual pension fund.
However, the expert points out that some change is expected this year, as the rally will be shifted to the week after the long weekend of the Constitution’s throne by the second week of December.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an Inversis Banco analyst, we are close to the technical level, and we can see a decline in the stock market index, which can also rise depending on news from the US, depending on the consequences of the credit market crisis.
The analyst trusts that they will be positive.
Analysts agree that they will be securities aimed at achieving the new maximum quota for Ibex.
Solana, from InterMoney, emphasizes that “there is a series of big securities this time.”
The expert would put the two major banks and some construction companies on the list, which will make the electric sector very expensive by then.
Federico Olucha claims from Inversis Banco that the rise is due to the banking sector and industry.
Rally can also be positive for construction companies, if it is at all.
“ACS has been trying to regain its positions for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow this path,” the expert said.
The cyclical consumption will be the main component of the rest of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also function well, although in this area they are not too high to represent in the Spanish market.
5 times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two times the December exchange rate took place.
The final rally of the year was observed in 2003, when stock markets had emerged from the crisis caused by the fall of the technological bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 adjusted 28,17 percent, a 6,68% jump was registered in December.
So it’s still open to see if 2007 will be the fifth year after each other (i.e., Ibex shows an increase of 8.36% since January) and whether the final rally can take place.
Banco Popular Español opens an account open for 12 hours from 200 Monday to Saturday
Banco Popular Español decided to renew most of its accounts.
This concerns a total of 200 accounts located in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the name Popular Max and bring a big change for the bank.
But also for other Spanish institutions, since this is the first group to have its accounts open continuously until 20.30 p.m. on Saturday, from 10 p.m. to 20.30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also said several times that it plans to extend its accounts, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
However, it is currently being agreed with trade unions that it would close 75% of its accounts in exchange for an afternoon, although not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for the other institutions, since it will be decided whether they will join the initiative to promote a more favourable opening of shops.
This is the purpose of the Banco Popular Español project.
In those places, I want to target individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local shops.
The bank wants to operate its 200 accounts throughout Spain for 18 months with the opening notice, as it is not a new opening order but an existing conversion.
To do this, the institution modernises its accounts in commercial zones according to the needs of customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening time is accompanied by a new idea of the nature of the accounts, a more modern, colorful design.
The commercial banks are responsible, Ángel Rivera points out that there is no need for a large investment in restructuring, but they need to employ more employees, which means eight or nine employees per account, instead of the current six.
Accounts in which even those who have been set up for SMEs will also be sold non-financial products.
Advantages of Experience
Banco Popular Español has already implemented the initiative in its three Madrid accounts.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experience was positive.
The Madrid Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía have been selected for accounts on the streets, and Rivero said the decision was correct.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2,500 accounts.
There are 60 more working under the name Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants, and it also has a very favorable opening order, even on Sundays and holidays.
In popularMax, you do not use the BBVA model where some accounts offer a wide range of non-financial products.
“We don’t want to create competition for our customers,” Rivero points out.
At the moment, they have reached agreement with Telefonica and will sell mobile phones with the use of external personnel.
Telecinco first doubles its rival Antena 3 stock exchange value
\"We did it.\"
With this sentence, he expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the closure of the market by Paolo Vasile, a telecinco-sponsored consultant, when it turned out that the TV player he was driving doubled the value of Antena 3.
“It’s only pain that it’s not because we’ve risen more, but because we’ve fallen less,” he said.
Even so, he stressed that the weak market “we fell less.”
Telecinco closed up by 2.54 percent yesterday.
This increase puts the annual loss to 15.66%.
52% of the company belongs to Mediaset, 13 percent of Vocento's, and the stock exchange value according to Bloomberg's data is 4.488.88.88 million euros.
His rival, Antena, had lost 1.52% yesterday and had a 40.5% fall since January, so yesterday, he reached half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other registered communications companies is 3.571 million for Sogecable; in the case of Prisa (the publisher of the Cinco Prize), 2.518.53 million and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 can be attributed to the similarities between the two companies.
The question is just how much we can meet on the same market, at what costs, and how it will turn out in the field of views.
Last week, Telecinco announced that he would like to be the first TV channel to be over $1 billion in advertising this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, Telecinco and Publiespaña. This is a subsidiary of the group’s advertising business.
If the stated fact is fulfilled, the TV channel would increase its revenue from advertising in the financial year 2006 compared to 965.4 million registered in the financial year this year.
The net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the financial year (such as 734.4 million), while the net sales of television increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
According to analysts, one of the factors that trigger Telecinco’s stock exchange momentum is the high payout that has been held up to now: in 2006, a 100% share of the profits of the company managed by President Alejandro Echevarría was distributed among its shareholders.
According to Vasile, even though it is too early to decide, this ratio may change after 33% of Endemol is taken with its parent company, associated with Mediaset.
“We guarantee a minimum 50% payment, although we have always shared a lot more.
I hope this year our shareholders will be satisfied with us, because we have already promoted them with 33% of Endemol’s stock.
Analysts say the market is currently characterised by some fall.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced Telecinco’s revenue estimates by 4 and 7 percent in 2008.
Their statement shows that the estimated increase in sales from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% in 2009 and from 5.5% in 2009.
According to the same company’s forecasts, the profit of Antena 3 is reduced by 4.5 percent in 2008 and 7.5 percent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: it proposes the purchase of both securities, mainly due to the high rental stability and long-term sustainable potential of the dividend.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco is more favorable than Antena 3 (maintenance) because of its more attractive and business strength.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, it proposes underweight due to the \"exploitant risks\" (the completed market and the less favourable economic climate).
The Congress approves the receipt of MiFID which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel to the parliamentary procedure, which today has closed with the Congress of Congress on Amendments to the Senate, the government has initiated a social dialogue on the regulation on the basis of the law to enable both to enter into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of different groups have consistently highlighted the efforts made by representatives and senators to negotiate and conclude agreements, which served as the most favourable norm for investor protection and the detailed regulation of the activities of companies in order to ensure effective market functioning.
Mifid, which amends the Securities and Markets Act, allows the modernisation of the financial markets, while at the same time strengthening the protection of investors, broadens the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities and Markets Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different supervisors of the European Union.
The new approach allows financial advisory services to be provided to specialised companies, but also natural or legal persons, as well as to securities trading companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, to establish a new financial service company form (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFI).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems suitable for the implementation of operations involving funds, thus adding multilateral trading platforms and commissioning systems to regulated secondary markets to compete with current stock exchanges.
Furthermore, the Act requires investment service providers to provide market information on the essential aspects, risk-taking and risk management methods of their business profile and to keep records of all operations carried out to facilitate the control of CNMV.
The Congress's Economic Committee has introduced a number of amendments, which are of particular importance that securities are treated as a \"complex\" currency, namely due to the high risk to the investor. This has been confirmed by the U.S. for high-risk mortgage credit (subprime).
On the other hand, the transfer of the directive was also used to legalize the scope of the activities of those with economic and entrepreneurship qualifications. This was 30 years after the Royal Decree setting out the professional functions only implemented by economists entered into force in 1977.
The Senate has proposed the creation of new actors in the financial sector, such as a broker who works for another account, does not need a CNMV license, and at the same time, it may market products or acquire customers for more investors.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November and reached 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account for the calculation of the inflation rate of the European Union, shows the trend in prices in Spain for the month of November.
The disclosure is consistent with the strategy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank to provide data comparable to the data from the United States, both the time of their creation and their nature.
For the preliminary indicator number, the same calculation method is used as for the calculation of the Harmonised Price Index, but the statistical modeling method differs from the evaluation of the information that is not yet available at the time of disclosure.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary indicator number is purely indicative, so it may be different from the final data to be disclosed on 14 December.
“The Consumer Price Index continues to show a relatively high value –
Pedro Solbes, one of the Vice-Presidents of the Government and the Minister of Economic Affairs, stated that the increase in consumer price index to 4,1 % in November was only of a \"temporary nature\" but, at the same time, predicted that the price index would be expected to show a value in the coming months.
In Parliament's corridors, Solbes confirmed that, although the indicator is not very favourable, the inflation rate in Spain has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also added that the November month brought less surprise than the previous month, when the Government did not expect such a great increase.
“We expected a value of around 4 %,” the Minister of Economic Affairs reported on the data published today.
Northern Rock wants 42 billion euros in three years.
Northern Rock's deposits fell by more than 50% and are currently only £12 billion (16 billion,800 million), since he was in crisis in mid-September and had to raise urgent loans from the English National Bank.
At that time, it had a record-rate deposit of more than 25 billion pounds, the number of which gradually decreased over the last two and a half months due to the loss of confidence of customers, despite the fact that the Government promised the bank a 100% guarantee until the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial, commercial name, Virgin Money. Virgin will have to earn about a quarter of the British banks’ revenues in the next three years to get the remaining 18 billion pounds and achieve the 30 billion goals.
Richard Branson’s group of high-ranking businessmen in England has decided to spend around £50 million (i.e. €70 million) per year on advertising and marketing to reach the target.
Northern Rock raised the offer of the Virgin consortium this week as the most favorable to avoid bankruptcy. Along with Virginia, three other companies form the consortium.
Mayor Totana was arrested for a alleged corruption case
The Police arrested the mayor of the Totana settlement in Murcia Province in the morning, as they suspect that he was involved in a city corruption scandal that exploded this week.
He was arrested by a secretary of the City Hall and the head of the city.
Former city representative José Martínez Andreo took over Juan Morales in May, who, according to the official bodies of the SER radio channel, could be the head of the corruption network.
The police will continue to investigate the city's offices and the City Development Council, and it will not be excluded that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' lawyer was also investigated as the main suspect of the corruption scandal that broke out this week.
According to the information provided by the SER radio, the lawyer of the People's Party Juan Morales was arrested when he left Morales with the documentation of corruption in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission that Morales received in exchange for signing a city development agreement with a Galician construction company on the transfer of 200 hectares of land.
There are currently eight people under arrest.
Bono accepts the appointment of PSOE in Toledo and Parliamentary President when they win the elections.
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the Secretary-General and the Socialist Party's Secretary-General José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's offer to lead the list of PSOE interpreters in the next parliamentary elections and to fill Parliament's presidential officer if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by the PSOE Secretary-General José Blanci at a press conference and confirmed by Bono himself in the party’s Federal Center after a meeting with Zapatero at noon.
The Prime Minister was justified by the election to the former minister that “we should count on the best of the best – in politics and in the best of the best.”
In addition, he added that, probably, the Manchai politician will be nominated by the Socialist Party for the Presidential Officer of Parliament if the Socialists win in the upcoming elections.
Bono would take over the place of President Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he was not willing to enter the next elections and to give up his political career, rather in scientific circles, to fight climate change.
The former minister acknowledged that the Head of Government has been constantly omitting to return to the political sphere since he left active politics two years ago.
He also added that, since the voters are aware of who the Economic Vice-President will be in the event of the socialist victory, the party would have wanted to inform them of who the President of Parliament would be.
If Bono were to fill in the post, he would like Parliament to “be more like the home of the citizens” to be “respective and not the color of insult or screaming.”
Unfortunately, Parliament seems to be the only place in Madrid, where there is no peace to talk about, it has already occurred that the Prime Minister’s speech has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate.
At the same time, he mentioned the current president, Manuel Marín, his “excellent work,” but he did not want to be mentioned as president, so that his opponents would not consider him “permanent.”
Campaign for Climate
Since the movement of climate change is relentlessly persecuted by both skeptical behaviors against their predictions and those who prefer political or social struggles, it must be very strong.
In addition, you must put on your side a political leader like Prime Minister Zapatero, who believes that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and declares that “we must make a new agreement with our Earth.”
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which the government’s activity or inactivity contributed to Spain’s failure to comply with the Kyoto Convention.
Who are responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is affected and why did the Government not strive to avoid it?
Spain should also explain clearly what measures it intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what habits of the population should we change, what individual and social energy savings should we expect and what economic consequences will be?
So who needs to sacrifice and who needs to pay to save our Earth?
But we didn't get an explanation, and we won't even get an explanation of these questions.
That's because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate change has always been unpopular.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and have expenses for both companies and the public.
Even PSOE’s fuel increase would have meant a lack of popularity before the elections, that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
We must save the Earth with mere propaganda, empty, real consequences-free passwords.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new offices.
With an agreement with the Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so well in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, and does not even build election meetings and wake up gentleness in us.

Mayor Totana and chief of police have been arrested for a alleged corruption case
The police arrested the mayor of the city of Totana in Murcai Province, José Martínez Andreot, the local police chief, the secretary of the City Hall, and a hospitality contractor for crimes related to urban development, informed police sources today.
The mayor was arrested in his home, then transferred to the City Hall, currently staying there with several police officers, many of whom are investigating the municipal body entrusted with the management of the City Development Council and Industry and Housing.
The three arrests were preceded by the arrest of six persons in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia last Monday in connection with a case in which 2 hectares of agricultural land can be built into an area to allow the construction of 4000 apartments for the Galicia company after unlawfully paid the managers a commission at the time of their previous mandate.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation under the notice of the Totana Court of First Instance.
The first person arrested was transferred to the court.
According to official sources, Totana's former mayor Juan Morales, who is now an independent MP of the People's Party, is also under investigation.
The former wife, who owns a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also examined as well as the current friend of the former mayor, who lives in the centre of Murcia Province.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A lawyer and entrepreneur were arrested in Nigrana (Pontevedra), together with the director of the Suelo de Inmonuar company Pablo José M.G.., and the latter company is part of the Nuaria Group and has been subjected to the losses through it.
The investigation is carried out by a group of crimes committed by the Organisational Central Unit of the Police Force at the Local Government level, of which 11 house investigations were conducted outside the arrests, mainly in companies related to those arrested, which operate in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the area, who could have played an intermediary role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in Totana, with 5000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company has acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which has been overstated. The project would have doubled the population of the currently 25,000 inhabitants.
Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, Vigoban, Coruna, Venezuelan Streets and Conycase, Preconiza, which specialize in direct marketing, and the sale, promotion and installation of building elements.

If they agree, we will put aside a little the Book of the Month and see if we can learn some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I've already equipped with one.
People, life is a constant change.
Of course, everyone can figure out something for themselves.

Our Finnish journalist found this comment in one of Finland’s largest daily newspapers: (of course, the world’s level of culture at the forefront of the PISA report), referring to the criticism of the book of Blackburn on 18 November.
“Philosophy teachings came to the public after Jokela’s high school tragedy.
The killer quoted the writings of Plato and Nietzsche in a student’s messages before graduation.
Education adviser Pekka Elo, who was responsible for teaching philosophy, demanded that teachers examine Plato's teachings with a critical view on the daily pages of the Helsinki Sanomat, and added that Nietzsche's knowledge is not necessarily important in the compulsory basic philosophy of secondary schools.

One of your colleagues will inform us that the Penal Code contains an error in the Internet downloads:
A. Download a music number is considered to be an error and can be punished from six months to one year.
However, if you steal a record of less than 400 euros in a store, it is only a violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal 1000 euros in a store, theft is already a mistake, but the penalty is still not reached at the level of the fine imposed on you when downloading the Internet (Article 234 BTK).
C. If you steal a car, but take it back in 40 hours, the penalty will still not reach the level of the fine imposed on you when downloading the Internet (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect a smaller punishment if you get into a fight than you copy CDs.
If you participate in a mass struggle, you can receive a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the BTK), but a penalty of six months to two years for copying CDs.
(Article 270 BTK).
According to Article 184.2 of the BKK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. Marketing of copyright-protected films without the consent of authors is more difficult to punish than selling pornography materials to minors (Article 186).

My doctor gave me an article on strange research with the following title: “Money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less of it.”
In other words, the feelings of employees on the day of payment depend on how much others received.
The experiment was conducted at the University of Bonn by measuring magnetic resonance tomographs, and the results were also published in the latest number of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and head of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, “The strongest activity was measured when the participant responded correctly, but the partner was wrong.”
Researchers found that if they both received the right answer and received the same amount of money, brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received a double amount, activity also strengthened.
I have no idea why such a great science was needed for such a simple conclusion.
The President of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been following the Balkan war criminals in the Hague for eight years, and the prosecutor's office investigating crimes in the former Yugoslavia.
His mandate ends at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a slightly bitter mouth, as he is responsible for the blood-loss in Srebrenica, during which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were murdered, namely General Ratko Mladic and the Bosnian leader Radovana Karadsich continue to be released.
Their name is on the list chosen by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as his documentary title: Carla's list (2006, Spain has not yet been presented). The film follows the work of the Swiss Attorney General from Belgrade to New York as he tries to exert pressure on the governments concerned to require loops around the refugees.
What kind of insurance does it meet me?
Motor insurance, which means safety against the various damage caused by the car owner and also depends on several factors, such as age, gender, date of acquisition of the licence, family status, type of vehicle to be guaranteed and the nature of use of the vehicle.
Buying a car is just the first step.
In addition, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding which car we want.
First of all, we need to know what this is about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This agreement is a body in the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company undertakes compensation in the form of a fixed insurance premium in the event of a loss.
The insurance premium is practically the amount paid for insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors such as age, gender, date of acquisition of a licence, family status, type of car to be guaranteed, its use, and others.
Insurance companies determine the insurance fee on the basis of the statistics, i.e. they pay a higher amount of an accident risk.
That’s why they are older than 25 or women pay less because statistics say they pose a lower risk because they’re more cautious.
Similarly, according to the reports, insurance companies have concluded that married people are causing fewer accidents than lonely people.
The frequency of the car’s type of use is crucial.
More frequent use increases the chance of an accident.
In determining the insurance premium, insurance companies take a number of factors into account.
Therefore, the owner must carefully check to select the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
In the following, we will present the most important factors of choice to best adapt and establish an acceptable price to the needs of the insured.
At the time of the conclusion of the insurance contract, under 25 years of age, there must be a number of disadvantages, such as the lack of driving experience and the freshness of the licence.
Although the most ideal, if we are protected from all threats, there are more economical solutions.
The more cautious managers can make a complete insurance with self-confidence, thereby ensuring that all threats are protected and the price will be affordable.
In such a type of contract, the insured pays part of the damage.
“The amount of the self-financing to be paid by the insured depends on the insurance fee; the higher the fee, the lower the part itself,” says Luis Noguera, the manager of the first Europa, the online insurance broker, in Spain.
Another option is liability insurance extended to third parties, where the client guarantees himself against the damage caused to others, but not against the damage caused by his own car.
In addition, there will be theft, fire and car loss.
A good advice.
If you are not 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents as far as possible, because this has an impact on the bonus and you can reduce the amount to be paid in the future.
Discounts granted in comparison to the basic tariff of the insurance company are known as bonus.
In comparison to the basic price, the penalty is called malus.
“The bonus and the scale of the Raspberry depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company has been a good year, you can allow yourself to increase the amount of the bonus,” explains Noguera.
If the age of 25 has already been exceeded, it is easier for the owners to make adequate insurance, as the risk of the accident is reduced due to the experience gained over the years.
Then we advise you to make a complete insurance with self-confidence.
“In addition, young people are not able to properly apply their experience in a single accident or even in driving,” says the director of the European insurance company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of driving, when drivers have already gone beyond the fear of beginners.
If the insured is already a woman, but you don’t have children, it’s best to have a complete insurance, of course, if your financial opportunities allow it.
Insurance companies hold children's spouses to the lowest risk customers, so in their case the fee to be paid is also lower.
In this case, the best for complete insurance is self-employed (it can reach 300 euros) or if you have a higher bonus, you can extend insurance to other damage from the third year of the vehicle.
“They drive more calmly, but at the same time they have greater customer power and can allow themselves to be higher in self-share,” Luis Noguera said.
In the case of pensioners, complete insurance is recommended by self-catering (around 150 euros) or in the case of a higher bonus, it can also be extended to liability insurance.
Motor insurance is a very important thing, not only because it represents protection for the owner in the event of damage, but also because it means a large amount of expenditure, so it is essential to choose a properly tailored form of insurance.
Celtic wants to get a point in Milan to get into the eighth final.
Milan and Celtic measure the strength of the San Siro stadium to acquire the missing point when the Champions League is closed. The Italians can be the first and the Scottishs can qualify themselves.
The Italians have ten points in total, and in the fifth round, they have guaranteed the success of a final defeat with Portugal, but Celtic has nine points, but there is still one more need to be the six-point Shakhtar, who will fight with the four-point Benfica, do not precede it.
The two matches of the D Group will be held one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan will have to play at the Club World Cup in Japan, where on 13th, he will try to fight for the 16th final.
With this, the D group will close earlier than the rest, and although the most likely result in the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium will be the final result, the two teams will strive to win, because the Italians do not want to stay home, and Celtic can start first from a better place in the 8th century.
Gordon Strachan's team is losing enough to qualify itself if Shahtar does not win, but it can't be certain, because if there's equality, the Ukrainians will get on to those who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but won the next match (2-0).
The Italians will try to destroy the night of the Scottishs, who would like to enter the eight finals of the League of Transnational Champions twice after receiving a goal from the Kaka in the last season (1-0).
The “Rossoners” win of Shakhtar would be most pleased because if he loses the Celtic will be in the eighth round and remain in the UEFA.
Since Benfica is currently in the last place and is unlikely to stay in the European Championship, you can still get the third place with a win that you can play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to participate in the first concert of Spice Girls.
Spice Girls began their tour in Vancouver (Canada), the first time before 20,000 viewers had been disbanded in 2000.
\"Posh Spice\" (Victoria Beckham), \"Scary Spice\", \"Baby Spice\" (Emma Bunton), \"Sporty Spice\" (Melanie Chisholm) and \"Ginger Spice\" (Geri Halliwell) were announced a few minutes before the concert in Vancouver GM Place.
About 20,000 people have changed their tickets to be there at the concert, where a video film has also been featured in the 1990s with huge successes in the history of the band.
In Spain, at the same time, the EMI launched a new album at the same time as the band's confrontation and the tour, including the larger Slagers and the two new songs \"Headlines\" and \"Voodoo\".
Five members of Spice Girls took the stage in a bracelet from her husband Posh Spice, British footballist David Beckham.
The sportsman was also there on the surface of the GM Place until he was suffocated, although he was banned by Victoria a few days earlier.
When the show came in, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star “he didn’t see our dress, so I’m nervous about what he would think of the show.”
\"Sporty Spice\", was the reason why the band split two years after leaving the band in 1998, \"because the members did not understand each other, he also seemed nervous during the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
“I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the feelings of people you felt about Spice Girls have changed.
I thought why not? Now I am glad that I decided,\" Chisholm said about the band that divided it nine years earlier.
The singer also added that during time, “the things have been arranged and we love each other very much.”
But a lot of things have changed since Spice Girls last appeared in 1998.
According to CTV television reports, Virgin Airlines arrived on a special plane to the band Vancouver.
At the airport, a team of baby-sitters were waiting for them.
They have seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the team performs in California (USA), then in San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
Madrid will have their action on 23 December.
Other fears about the Russian-Ukraine gas dispute
The gas supply between Ukraine and Russia has been renewed, which could affect Russian fuel to be transported to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transferred through Ukraine and disputes between the two nations are always a great deal of attention.
Kiev stated that if Moscow increases the price of gas paid by the Ukrainians, they will also hit Russia with higher transit costs.
As a result of a previous debate between the two countries last year, the supply to EU countries has decreased.
The recent debate between Kiev and Moscow was launched between the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, the Gazprom’s attempt to make an agreement on the amount of gas to be paid by Ukraine in 2008.
Gazprom stated that a 50% increase in gas produced from neighbouring Turkmenistan should be made compared to the price agreement with Ukraine for 2008.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of the shipment from Gazprom to Ukraine.
“It is important to argue during the negotiations in accordance with one of the most important transit states for natural gas,” said Anatolij Kinah, Ukrainian Minister of Economic Affairs of Reuters.
\"The changes in gas prices should definitely be linked to our debate on the extent of the costs of transits to Ukraine (and to Western Europe)\"
As a result of the recent significant gas sales between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas team to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has resulted in a dominant decrease in exports to Western Europe, which has also significantly increased prices.
A quarter of the European Union’s gas supply is made up of Russian gas.
Russia has the largest natural gas reserves in the world, but most of them are still undiscovered.
As a result, Gazprom’s own gas supply is complemented by natural gas from the former Soviet countries in Turkmenistan and other Central Asia.
The NHS is obliged to check foreign workers.
The Committees of the Scottish NHS have to improve the control of the criminal records of workers from outside Europe, a supervisory body said.
The proposal was made by Robert Black’s chief accountant, following a foreign-citizen’s attack on the airport in Glasgow in June in Scotland.
Black also expressed concern about NHS Scotland's lack of accurate data on the number of overseas workers.
At the same time, in its report, through the five samples of health authorities, he also pointed to key controls that have been carried out properly.
Following the attack on the airport in Glasgow, the chief accountant checked the list of staff recruited outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old Bilal Abdullah, a medical doctor from the Royal Alexandra Hospital, in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jap ran into the building’s headquarters.
Abdullah was one of the three doctors who had been interviewed by the Old Bailey Court in October in charge of the bombing attempts in the UK.
The NHS Committees shall, in the case of their employees from overseas countries, verify the existence of the qualifications and work experience of the workers concerned before starting employment and the availability of permits for employment in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Committees are using Disclosure Scotland to check the criminal record, the Agency is not entitled to obtain information of this kind originating outside the UK.
The report of the chief accountant suggested, among other things, that the committees introduce the Code of the Criminal Register Office, which facilitates the monitoring processes with the various overseas countries for the employer.
“Although we have found evidence of such checks among the records of staff, they are not carried out regularly,” the report says.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS performs its own investigation procedure prior to employment at a high level, adding: “Our report highlights the areas of the system to be developed in order to have up-to-date information on the number of NHS overseas personnel.
Dr. Peter Terry, president of the BMA Scotland, said that it is “unpredictably unreal” that, through pre-employment checks, we could identify potential NHS employees who could carry out terrorist acts in the future.
“The report states that the pre-employment checks currently being carried out are working well in the NHS Scotland, and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent,” he added.
According to the Scottish health authorities, the current number of overseas workers in most of them are 1161.
However, the chief accountant pointed out that the numbers are likely to be higher, partly explaining that there is a problem for the committees with the identification of workers on a permanent basis.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures in the Ayrshire and Arran, the Grambin, the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian are largely coordinated.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, work permits and the documents certifying professional qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the directive and guidance on pre-employment checks for NHS workers from overseas countries.
Nicola Sturgeon, secretary of health, said: “I am very pleased that after the attack on the airport in Glasgow, this task has been carried out.
In addition, he added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take into account the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that the updated version will be published in the next month.

In Saudi Arabia, 208 people were arrested for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that 208 militants involved in terrorist cells were arrested for the execution of an attack on an oil facility, as well as more attacks on religious and security forces.
According to the state television of the world’s largest oil exporter, one cell was trying to smuggle missiles.
The Al-Qaeda supporters launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been active as an ally of the United States since the 2003 Iraq invasion.
According to the television report, an eight-person cell led by a foreign citizen to launch an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province.
Following the 2006 attack attempt by Al-Qaeda against the largest oil processing equipment in the world, Abqaq, Saudi Arabia began to build a 35 000-person rapid-reacting force to protect the facilities.
According to the report of the Minister of Interior, 18 of the arrested are a cell led by a person specializing in the \"missile shootings\" of the country's borders.
The report also reported that the warriors tried to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom.
On 22 of them, plans were made to commit attacks against religious leaders and security forces.
The government called on the Church leaders to step down the Saudis, which are in the process of joining the Al-Qaeda fighters, who are fighting against the Islamic government of allied forces and the U.S.-backed ski Muslim government. The more recent Saudi hard-line saunas are considered as heretics.
Al-Qaeda’s fighters are considered to be significant leaders in Saudi Arabia by the authorities in support of the policies of the royal family that govern the government.
The leaders of the organization - encouraged by the call of Al-Qaeda Saudi leader Osama bin Laden to target the Western Saudi government - the attack on foreign settlements, government buildings and energy facilities.
“The security forces have made a huge effort in the last five months,” said a spokesperson from the Interior Department for public television.
During the arrests in Medina, a 16-person “media cell” was also caught, with the aim of spreading “takfiri thought.” The thought of takfiri is the ideology of the Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports the violent action against the disbelief and distrusted Muslims.
There were also 32 people accused of financial support from the militants.
The climate of Venus can provide an insight into the future of the Earth.
Scientists found that Venus once could provide pleasant living conditions.
The data of a European orbiting spacecraft suggest that this planet is much more regarded as Earth’s vast twin brother than we thought before.
Venus is Earth's nearest planetary thirst.
In terms of the size of the two planets, almost the same and their orbits are similar, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
According to scientists today, millions of years ago, there could have been very similar living conditions in Venus and even living relationships.
However, due to the high carbon greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion caused by sunlight and the low rotation rate of the planet, Venus has entered a different path of development.
Today, water was evaporated from the planet, its surface temperature was hot enough to melt lead, and hurricane-powered winds and lightning storms are destroyed.
The findings of the European Space Agency Venus Express spacecraft, based on a study of the planet for a year, are a predictive picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes can develop on Earth.
Fred Taylor, a professor at the Department of Physics at Oxford University, who is one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “Let us draw out why the climate of Venus is so much different from that experienced on Earth, despite the fact that the two planets are otherwise very similar.
“Our new data enabled us to develop a script about the development of Venus with billions of years ago, when they could have living conditions similar to Earth.
\"Supplemented uranium\" booked by police
A kilo of radioactive material - the reported uranium - was removed yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesman, three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The spokesperson did not confirm whether it was about enriched uranium, but stated that the material would have been sold for $1 million (480,000).
Open Gates
According to Mitt Romney, it is not worthy of a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
However, the Republican candidates of the presidential election agreed to participate in a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on the video and forwarded them to candidates.
None of the questions left on Wednesday night was as ridiculous as the snowman asking the Democrats about global warming in the debate on YouTube by the other party.
However, this time the questions and answers reflected the situation of the Republican Party approaching next year’s election.
It is not yet known what exactly is the basis for the production managers of CNN who co-financed the dispute to select YouTube clips submitted to candidates.
The longest question of the first half of the debate was immigration.
This is one of Republicans' sex couples.
CNN has asked some uncertain voters to make a call when they have been asked to make a call: the mediator has experienced an excellent agreement when the candidates have said a lot about the issue of borders.
The liveliest and longest debate was held between Rudy Giuliani at national level, as well as in the crucial pre-elections held in Iowa and New Hampshire, in the progressive Romney.
Giuliani is trying to change the image that he has dealt with the issue of illegal immigration too easily during the mayor of New York.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build a house in Massachusetts.
The war between the two became particularly intense when the questioners were interested in the “Amnesty” support (which would provide illegal immigrants with permanent status and the possibility of citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as the California Californian Duncan Hunter and Tom Tancredo's coloring representatives, have been able to take a deep look at the subject.
And although none of them are likely to be on the label, their remaining on the race track may be explained by the fact that they began to connect the bell that was on immigration sooner and louder than the others.
At least in the area of immigration, a broad consensus can be observed between the candidates: a common goal is to strengthen borders and to act hard on illegal immigrants.
This topic, such as the fear of Chinese toxic games and other alarming factors coming from the outside world, helps the Republicans within the Berkes to forget or minimize the division between liberals and Christian conservatives.
However, when topics of a different nature were brought to the forefront, the debate was very unpleasant.
Giuliani had to face the question of why he had previously supported the arms control.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether the simulated flooding should be considered torture.
Another questioner asked if the candidates believed all the Bible’s words.
In this question, Giuliani finally discovered in the point of view that although he viewed the Bible as his favorite book, Jonah and the whale’s story might not be interpreted literally.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who was the first place to get the Iowa election, who had won his victory over Christian conservativeism, responded to expectations that the death penalty was painful, but it was necessary.
When they were worried if Jesus had enough support, he said that Jesus was wiser than that of the elections.
Competition remains unusually open.
Huckabee's Iowa's momentum coincides with the action of Libertarian Ron Paul, and with the enthusiastic excitement of his debate on Wednesday.
The sudden emergence of the two candidates is explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet succeeded in launching a common candidate among the aspirins representing more well-known and traditional principles.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who, in time and with conviction, had a winning message about America’s size and found a common voice with both sides of the party.
But now the party is divided and its consequences are not yet visible.
Working Party Pains
Another break in front of Gordon Brown; the way out is unchanged
Compared to British political scandals, it does not seem too far-reaching.
No one has sold his honor, no politician has ever found out about the Paris hotel accounts, no one has committed an extra-marital scandal.
However, the discovery that a rich businessman under the name of others for more than four years contributed a sum of $650,000 ($1.3 million) to the Labour Party, who ruled Britain, and that the party did not report this, one of the things without which the surrounded Gordon Brown would have been well-equipped.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister got away with the election, and when, in his statement, public opinion studies did not affect the outcome of the decision, he questioned the intellectual ability of the British people, people were still hoping that Brown would provide a strong and effective governance.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the vice-president of the Liberal Democrats noted, once feared Brown Stalin became Mr. Bean.
The failure to save a tight bank called Northern Rock has crossed the regulatory weaknesses and misconceptions.
The patient proposals for amending the tax law have encouraged business interest groups to join the government.
The loss of 25 million people's personal data by the tax authorities has revealed an improbable level of administrative inadequacies.
In the House of Lordok, there were three peaceful generals who protested against the reduction of the army budget, stating that the position of the Minister of Defence was part-time occupation.
And now there are David Abrahams' mysterious donations; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of the Labour Party (formerly the Head of Administration), has already resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown wouldn't be back on the way to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach the point where governance is impossible.
People don’t like politicians and don’t trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually stop their unbelief.
However, as it becomes clear that the Prime Minister is highly unlikely to be able to make things forward, and perhaps not stay on the post for a long time, the end of the suspended infidelity: the public ministry will begin to leak, the cabinet ministers will be adjusted, the press will look after bad oral news; and the government will begin to defend and be unable to concentrate.
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult situation, as unlike other political leaders, he does not count as “fresh blood.”
As much as you want to deny your relationship with Tony Blair, it was his right hand.
The problems surrounding Northern Rock and tax records, for example, are related to decisions taken during Brown's Finance Department.
And although there was not directly involved in Blair's bad actions, such as the \"no cash\" issue and the pro-political party funding relationship, voters are entitled to assume the opposite.
Even though Brown's situation is really unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it seems.
The attacks are not as scary as they are indicated by the throats.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was taken directly.
And compensation, whatever pain, can always create promised directions by Stalin, who lives in Brown: reliable, firm and slightly hard-handed governance.
For example, it serves as a fidelity around political donations.
Garboian cellist Abrahams, who compares his gift to charity, said that he did not want to spread his charity to the public.
Perhaps so, however, making the decision was not his responsibility.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of major political supporters is clear and purely justified: the population has the right to know who knocks on the heads of the country.
Watt, who, according to his own statement, knew about Abrahams’ measure, was not aware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweating during the interrogations; just like Jon Medleson, founder of the Labour Party, who was informed of the disturbing donations in October.
Brown, however, for the time being, does not lead the strands: nothing suggests that he knew about these spins, even that the huge amounts were paid to Brown's office after his move to June.
He has done half of the Prime Minister's task to this day.
However, he quickly condemned the violation by his party, but his firmness was extended to a familiar tool; he ordered a commission led by a retired bishop and a judge to investigate the case, for the sake of security.
In this story, the “teachable lesson” is not too complicated.
In the event of an infringement, the police are competent.
In addition, Brown should take care of other matters, such as the appointment of the president of an independent committee on administrative rules without a leader six months ago or the effective reform of political party funding.
This would require the hard-fishing Labour Party to cooperate with the Tories and break up with special financial relations with associations - this would be a hard wall for Party Brown.
But you should face some of the party-related facts.
According to the survey, conservatives are currently leading with a serious advantage; Brown has two years to win voters back behind themselves; the only way to make the win is the incontinence and strong competence.
Card sharks
Does the secondary market mortgage market crisis threaten the American credit card market?
When blood is poured into the water, it is natural that sharks appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is weaker, predators are focused on the country's credit card market.
The analysts of Goldman Sachs believe that if the mortgage credit crisis is infecting other forms of retail loans, the credit card market will lose up to $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
Both a description of the rate of interest rate and the default rate for late payments over 30 days.
HSBC reported a loss of $1.4 billion last month in the US consumption finance segment, partly due to the financial weakness of card holders.
At the same time, panic is still early.
The rates of the specifications and late payments are still low.
The late payment rate of 3.8% by Moody's credit rating agency for the third quarter is a percentage lower than the historical average.
The decrease in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
The change in the U.S. rules of individual insolvency in 2005 resulted in a sudden decrease in insolvency in the number of reporting agents, but at the same time caused a large loss in the credit card market; a re-elevation of the number of bankruptcy claims (and thus the description ratio) is expected, whether the total of the terms and conditions of borrowing deteriorate or not.
The payment rate, which shows the percentage of the monthly loan repayment of consumers, is also stable on the market.
In addition, trust in securities covered by credit cards is also rather strong, despite the deterioration in other areas of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney at the TowerGroup research company estimates that the 2007 emissions will be 25% higher than last year.
The effects of the mortgage market crisis are clear on the credit card market: consumers increase debt on credit cards to pay off housing loans.
At the same time, card issuers pay attention primarily to cash movements and not to asset value, so the fall in housing prices does not necessarily lead to a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
The situation that has arisen can be beneficial to creditors.
If the property is less than the value of the mortgage, the incentive for consumers to cancel the loan will decrease; as a result, the repayment of debt on credit cards will go ahead of the priority ranking.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can adapt faster and more flexibly to changing conditions than mortgage lenders.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of a sudden reflow of assets.
“It is unlikely that one day we will wake up to fully reassess the loans,” says Gary Perlin, the Financial Manager of Capital One.
If a subprime sudden crisis on the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual recession is much more likely.
If the falling prices on the housing market and the fall in the lending process lead America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly look forward to a tough future.
It is worth watching those predators.
British bankers declared themselves guilty of the Enron case
Wednesday, the three British bankers who were brought to court by Enron’s former financial director, to investigate their role in the fraud of Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were initially accused of being innocent of being a seven-time fraud, which is believed to have been collaborating with Fastow in a 2000-year-old secret fraud that their employer wanted to gain.
Their trial began in January.
But in a court hearing, before the U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each of them admitted his guilt in a single-order fraud.
The three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group Greenwich NatWest have become known during the two-year extradition process in Great Britain.
After the collapse of Enron in 2001, the investigation of the case launched in the United States is still waiting for you.
The first prosecution against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of his targets for the government investigation into the bankruptcy of Enron.
According to their accusations, the three brokers baptized “NatWest Three” in 2000 traveled to Houston in order to prepare fraud with Fastow and Michael Copper, who was then better at Fastow.
Fastow, responsible for designing numerous fraud in Enron, also held under the control of Enron’s subsidiary, which was invested in Greenwich NatWest.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank did not know about any of the shares in the subsidiary, but the three British men knew well that the interest was very high.
A company managed by Copper bought the bank's share of $1 million in the subsidiary.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to get a share in this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow misinformed Enron that the energy company would buy the $20 million subsidiary share from Greenwich NatWest.
But in fact, $20 million was hit by British bankers, Fastow, and others.
The charge is estimated to be $7.3 million, while the bankers reached $2.3 million in Fastow, Copper and others.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed his dual guilt due to the fall of Enron.
The British three were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently in a six-year sentence in a state-owned federal prison in Louisiana.
Copper spends three years and a month in a Texas prison.
In the head of the three English men, he could travel to the United States with $1 million bail per head, where they are under trial.
Enron, the seventh largest U.S. company, reported bankruptcy in December 2001, after the accounting tricks that have been applied since the years could no longer cover millions of debt-acquised and profitable, but actually loss-making businesses.
Due to the collapse, thousands of jobs were lost, the market value decreased by more than $60 billion, and the value of pension funds decreased by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, founder of Enron and former CEO Jeffrey Skillling, was convicted for their part in the company's bankruptcy last year.
Skilling is currently in prison for more than 24 years.
The conspiracy, fraud, and other charges imposed on Lay ended with the death of the man last year.
There is no poverty in Moscow
At $54 million, a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine will start without interrupting the route between Moscow and Los Angeles with a tank.
But this amount is only a small amount for some Russian rich.
“18 passengers can fit in,” said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
“But no one orders so many seats because the machines are bought for private families or corporate leaders.”
Mr. Firer expected visitors to the four-day, exclusive, Milliomos Fair, which was held in a huge exhibition hall around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury pieces were rented at the exhibition, hoping that the Russian new riches would be interested in all the yachts from the mahogany-covered yachts to the diamond, 50 cents.
Mr. Firer carefully observed the bright orange Porsche next to him.
“It’s a nice car, but it’s not worth our products,” he said.
Private aircraft have the largest market in Russia after the United States.
It seems that the Russian capital swims in money as Dallas did it during the time of the oil explosion.
“We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some Americans went to Europe in a millionaire. These Americans were considered to be materialists here,” Marshall Goldman, Senior Scholarship of the Davis Centre for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Japanese players of Saudi Arabia and the 1990s, the Russians have now become the world’s best poets.
The most exclusive luxury brands demand their share of the gold bowl.
At another conference organised by the luxury industry in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault shared their views on how to sell high-value products on markets similar to Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to the list of the richest people in Forbes, there are 53 billion people in Russia who have a total of $282 billion.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103 thousand, who can make a total of $670 billion, has established a study by economists at the Economic and Financial Research Centre, which analyzed personal welfare development in the former Soviet Union.
(On the basis of the World Bank data, in 2005 the number of people living under the minimum of living in Russia was 15.8 per cent.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, and that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of London’s David Morris jewelry store.
Nicole participated in the market for the first time with the Russian distributor Soho Jewelry Group.
\"All women were uncontroversial, and men are a real treasure mine.\"
In the rooms on Sunday evening, two real estate sales agents, the 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and the 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, both themselves and their customers, were considered to be millionaires.
\"I looked at the cars and tried to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,\" said the young Yumatova, who was pymassed in his custom-designed clothes, as if he had been used to this uplift.
The fair was directed primarily for the new rich, for brand-oriented Russian customers who are willing to go around a cozy, cifran-decorated place after several hours, where you can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pockets, Mözenpick ice cream, regular billiard tables, dubai apartments, and Gundyss masks at the same time.
For average people, the ticket costs 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
“The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best,” said Mr. Gijrat, who, with a patriotic view of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft stand, had a wall-sized, hand-painted, blue-painted print by Rembrandt.
“The Russians are more interested in the obvious things, of course.”
Indeed, the sellers here said that the rich Russians, based on the Russian standards, have already agreed from the exhilarating logos to the Bagatell, a limited number of brands that would not be admitted to a trade fair.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, were commissioned by millionaires, and tourists, spent the space every day in a crowd.
Some of them bought it.
On the first day of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the director of the King Koil Beds, said that he sold two mattresses with a gold medal made of silk, cashmere and cotton.
Also on the night of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales member of A1 Moto, engaged in modern alarming high-quality cars, reported that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
Andrei Karapetaan, the luxury car manufacturer, who delivers solutions to individual needs, is the president of L.A. Connection for Sunday afternoon selling three refrigerants to Rolls-Royce Phantoms. The grids are similar to connected chain bracelets and are charged to $55,000 each.
He also showed reporters a garden designed for the owner of a Russian casino, which he said was involved with Swarovski crystals to make a roulette wheel look.
The price of a set of four pieces is $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants a picture of a scucco skin and his wife’s face from a circus cube will not necessarily use these objects,” Karapeta said.
“They will be kept in a 30-40-car garage.”
Despite the fact that many Russian customers are rich, Karapetaan says that the term “Russian millionaire” today does not constitute a great privilege in view of the rapid rise of property prices there.
“He who bought property in Moscow four or five years ago is likely to be millionaires if not in money, but at least on paper,” he said.
“There are more than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least create the appearance of wealth in front of the founder of the Alliance Continental Russian wealth management company.
The company built four English-style telephone boxes, which were collected with millions of fake dollar banks.
Azad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, said his team printed 500 thousand fake banknotes for the Milliomos Fair.
Many of the visitors have stopped playing with money. Many of them have taken photos of themselves by mobile phone as they are exposed in the money ring, or just put a few million in pocket.
“You see, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karryev said.
They're suspected of having a murder in New Jersey.
It happened on the day before Thanksgiving that Ronald Livingston looked at the window of a restaurant called “just a little healthier” and saw a lifeboat standing on Cape Cod with two doors down West Scott Avenue.
A police car arrived shortly later.
Then another one.
“Then I saw the doctor’s car stop,” said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant supervisor.
“Then I knew someone was dead.”
The authorities found out that the dead woman was 41 years old, named Olga Arroyo. She previously worked as a senior assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
There is currently an investigation to determine whether death was caused by an intervention by an unidentified cosmetic surgeon working under the West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have failed to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they hope that the results of the toxicology tests in a few weeks will light up this mysterious death that affected the high-ranking staff of the Newark police with great pain.
Arroyo, whose voice has been known to many in the department, has worked as an assistant to the police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
“It was loyal, diligent and reliable,” McCarthy said in a Wednesday interview about Arroyo.
He was my housekeeper.
He was my defender.
McCarthy told me that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, who was currently working on the Control Committee for the Sector Products, and left two boys, a 14 and 11 years old, as well as a stepmom.
The spokesperson of Eilen Walsh, the prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the investigators were working to investigate whether Mrs. Arroyo was the victim of an unlicensed surgical intervention.
\"His probability is up,\" Walsh said.
\"The investigation is currently ongoing,\"
According to the reports from the authorities, he arrived at the house around 3 p.m. in the afternoon.
On the 21st and Arroyo women were found on the couch.
He was declared dead on the spot.
Over a week ago, the police sold very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't tell me if Castro had been heard by the detectives.
Participants are investigating whether part of the house is functioning as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one opened a door in Castro's home, where a deered rose bush was standing in the narrow front yard and a songless barking from the back of the house.
In addition to the door leading to the cellar, a blue tank in the car door was marked with a sign called Etil Vanilil, which is used to replace vanilla in food and perfumes.
Turned from campuses to two mountain bikes.
McCarthy recalled that after 25 years at New York Police, she first arrived in Newark, Mrs Arroyo, was an invaluable help by helping her align her with the unusual and unspeakable political culture of the new city.
“He always said, “It’s better to take care of it and it’s better to take care of it,” he remembered.
He was always here when I arrived in the morning and was still in the evening when I left.
It was confusing.
Expectations for the cut of interest rates lead to a collapse of the world’s stock markets
On both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, the stock prices jumped yesterday after the calming statements of the US Central Bank’s Deputy President increased his hopes that the Fed will try to ease investment opportunities by further interest cuts.
The stock markets in London, New York, and Europe were abandoned after Donald Kohn, who said he was the better hand of the Fed president, Ben Bernake, had to react “sufferably and pragmaticly” in financial markets.
In addition to the clear objective of Kohn to mitigate the markets in the midst of the signs of the resumption of credit crisis, he stated that the present unrest “returned the development of the market at the end of September and October.”
He said that if the increased confusion persists, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on the credit conditions of households and companies.
The statements were interpreted as being ready to inject fresh capital on American markets or even further interest rates reductions in order to stabilise credit conditions.
The statements have also restated on Wall Street, which has been reported to be a number of bad news about the American economy, such as the negative record of the number of American apartment sales.
The side effects of financial unrest were also confirmed by the announcement of the Bear Stearns Investment Bank that it would cost 650 employees as part of the cost reduction and 4% of its global labour force in order to offset the losses in the second-market housing credit sector in the USA.
The total of 20 jobs in London, which employs 1500 workers, are affected by the above measure.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average increased by 331 points, 2.55% and closed at 13.289.40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The FTSE 100 index in London increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 percent and closed at 6.306.2, and increased the value of British blue-chip companies by more than 39 pounds.
The German Dax grew by 2.6 percent, while the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
The credit market anxiety was renewed after the European Central Bank’s large-demand auction, which had not seen three-month-time papers since April 2001 at a price of 4.7%.
After the English interbank rate, Libor reached the highest value since September after a steady growth since 12 November, and the Bank of England was pressured to follow Fed and the ECB and to provide additional capital to the London money market.
The decision is required in England between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
He gave me two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who should be the English team in the sixth meze Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in the context of the first test against Sri Lanka, it is not less important, who makes the decision?
The latter question is, on the one hand, because David Graveney, the president of the selections, who temporarily performs this particular task, will assist coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughn in the decision. On the other hand, because the office of the English Executive Director, Hugh Morris' desk, starts to meet the requests for a national or at least one-off selection post.
Among the two players, the shortest one that doesn’t get the sixth spot, but as well as known, life and, in particular, sports are often unfair.
It’s never easy to tell you how to reach the peak of someone’s calling, while others can’t get past a lower level. Many times, it’s more fortunate than it depends on talent.
It is not just a criticism that it is difficult to - often on a subjective basis - to choose.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to Shah if that happens?
The same question can be raised in other areas of life, for example, when we say John Edwards and \"Tubby\" Banerjee, two smart young leaders with excellent qualifications would be placed before decision-makers, while there is room for only one of them.
Who can tell which level is a Cricket player without throwing him into deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, the data greatly influence the decision, but the possibilities are equally important.
In a team, the player needs to catch the captain's look at it in the Cricket Cabinet at the right moment, and a bat player must have a chance to become a big player once.
The look of the selections is much more complicated.
More than James Anderson, for example, played better in the past season, but he is sure to be a team member at the first test, despite Stephen Harmison’s own statement that he is in good shape and that the blow is going very well for him.
Anderson fought 32 first-class gates and 33 runs to participate in the tournament.
Chris Tremlett only hit 29, but both of them had successful moments at the highest level, hoping that they would be like this in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at the Asgiriya Stadium, it will be decided on the basis of opinions.
This decision can shake or break anyone’s career, but it may also not have a special impact on the future.
Four years ago, Sri Lankán Gareth Batty played well in all tests and performed well with five gates and 40 useful runs, but Paul Collingwood, who was then emerging at the time, became an outstanding and decisive test critic, who may still be underestimated even today, despite the fact that in Australia, he received a double hundred points against Australia.
It is likely that when listening to the conservative feelings of Graveney, Vaughn and Moores at the Asgiriya Stanion in today’s game, they will be able to take their vocals against the young life force and dynamism of Bopara, in addition to Shah’s greater experience.
Both sides of the argument.
In addition to Shah, he's a bright and successful debut in the four quarters of the 88-year-old Bombay test. He's seven years younger than the 22-year-old Bopara six, who's also in excellent twists, he reached 32 first-class hundreds.
However, the fact that the Middlesex player in Shah was at home in May at the Lorda test ran only ten in two quarters against West Indies, and that, in order to re-engage the next game, Vaughan faced the immediate resistance of the selections, appears to have reduced the perseverance that was still evident in Bombay.
Against him, the universal talent of Essex is a lifelong and inexhaustible player.
There is nothing to be said on the cruise track, but he described his behavior outside the field well when he was in an exhibition with the team's auto sponsor Volkswagen's four-wheel drive.
However, the first thing he did after was that he took over Vodafone's phone (naturally sponsored) and called his remote teammate, Alastair Cook, to ask him, \"You saw this.\"
Bopara classics have a better track edge player. For its intense medium steps, he creates a preferred pitch angle, and his punches are confident and competent.
Choosing the right person is one thing and another is the right moment.
Maybe this is the real art of choice.
Personally, I'd give Bopara a chance, which doesn't mean that I don't think Shah would give an outstanding one if, as the tea leaves in Ceylon suggest, he would be the one who plays this weekend.
They transport refugees home with buses to work and fight Al-Qaeda.
Since yesterday, the first buses from Syria have arrived in Baghdad with Iraqi refugees who have lost their money or have expired their visa, or actually those who hope to return to the city have returned to order.
There are also those who have returned to fight with the soldiers who have taken them out of their house.
The Mansour bus station was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government console of 800 people from Damascus filled with dozens of buses.
“I decided to go to Syria after a lot of doctors were killed in Baghdad,” said Dr. Sabah al-Qubasi.
“Today I returned because I saw what happened on TV and newspapers in Baghdad and that the city is now safe.
“It is said that the Mahdi army stopped killing people,” he added, referring to a minister of Moqtada al-Sadr's milicist who has now stopped his army of plain people.
Mostly, a 38-year-old ski teacher from Amariayah, who lived by the saunas, Qassim al Atwani returned home with two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime in there prevented Iraqis from taking up work.
The neighbors of the Amariai plain called him and urged him to return home, saying that with the help of the American-backed troops, Al-Qaeda was able to cut off from their charm in the western part of the capital city.
One of Jordan’s first arrivals was a Sannita and a ski tribal leader who fled a grenade attack from his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad, after his fellow citizens were encouraged to fight Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, my friends called me and told me they created an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed my support and support for my sons.
That's why I came back today,\" said Sabaah Alu Obei, 62.
Many spoke of the fact that since the US troops were involved in the capital, they were being lured home by armed civilian forces working with Americans.
However, more people were forced to return from Damascus due to visa-related and financial problems.
The 51-year-old, three-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai voiced a widespread view of the refugees that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki asked the Syrian government to reject the visa application for refugees to force their return.
It is said that more than two and a half million people have fled the country's death squads.
“It was all right until Al-Maliki’s visit to Syria and did not put pressure on the government not to issue more visas for Iraqis to move home,” said the sauna pensioner.
“I can’t trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I fled.”
One of the reasons for the relief of violence is that the saunas were removed from the plains, while the skis also left the Sunni populated areas. As a result, tensions in many areas decreased.
Many people are afraid that the sudden appearance of refugees will re-introduce the fields, which can lead to new battles.
Small Saar-land - student training
The smallest federal province plays a leading role in vocational training, and its higher education is an international orientation.
Only in an area of training, islanders are struggling with the same deficit as the rest of the country.
“Today, 50 times I explained to an outside of the island that we are not French – this self-iron slogan is advertised on its posters on the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the island region, which, based on the survey of the German Institute of Economics (IW), can boast with the fifth place.
In this way, higher education institutions cooperate closely with neighbouring countries, just because of traditions.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
Students who study here can still be closed with a double or even three degree.
As a result, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent higher.
However, more than average appeals to those who want to study in the island region are also attracted to colleges and universities in the island, many of them do not have a high school degree.
“In the island, the opportunities for professional training are exploited,” explains Axel Plynnecke, an educational expert at the German Economic Institute.
Young people have acquired higher education qualifications in more than five vocational schools, and the island region exceeds the federal average by more than seven percent.
The combination of professional and higher education has also been well developed.
The infrastructure for double studies is located in the second place in Germany in terms of population.
Despite practical-oriented training and growing interest, the number of graduate engineers has decreased by a third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education in the island therefore committed the higher education institutions to a marketing campaign focused on engineering.
“In general schools, we have launched a number of reforms after the first Pisa study,” said a spokesperson at the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has conducted comparative tests across the country.
To start learning earlier, the last kindergarten year is free of charge. This is a model that, in the meantime, the other federal provinces began to copy.
To ensure that the performance of students continues to improve, only future comparative studies will provide answers.
Based on the Pisa survey conducted in 2003, the percentage of students at risk has fluctuated from 29 to 20%.
However, the overall performance of the Saarland did not improve to the extent that other federal provinces did.
The Bavarians count better.
The biggest revenge of the island regions during the Pisa survey does not take into account the foreign language knowledge - otherwise, they would otherwise be able to reap beans in this area,
Because the language of neighbouring countries is mandatory in high schools - even if the islanders are not French.
Chávez will change the hours
In Venezuela, in the near future, hours are different than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez will turn the time scales back in the Latin American country for half an hour.
Chávez in Spain became an object of laughter.
As Venezuela's official newspaper said, in accordance with a new law, the clocks will be reversed four and a half hours compared to the Greenwich time.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not in use in any other country in the world.
Anti-US Chávez, among other things, justified his decision to force the entire hours-based time zones of the United States into the world.
Chávez announced on Wednesday the interruption of relations with neighbouring Colombia due to a hostage.
Left-wing nationalist politician declared that until the Conservative Alvaro Uri is in contact with the President of Colombia, neither the Head of State nor the Colombian government.
“I can’t do this because of my own dignity,” said Chávez, who called for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the country of oil should make a statement on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, it would significantly build its power in the country.
The reason for the debate was Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chávez’s mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe, by his decision, “aarcul smote, Venezuela, gave a voice to his criticism of Chávez on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chávez.
In the country, a new mobile ring voice raised the impression: “Por Qué no callas” (Why don’t you shut up), which is how more than half a million people have already downloaded from the internet.
The sentence comes from John Charles, the king of Spain, who was so upset at the recent Latin America summit by the constant public announcements of the populist politician in Balolda that he cut his word in this way.
In 2007, the Germans were threatened with a drop in wages.
According to a forecast, real wage cuts threaten German workers this year despite strong conjunctuation.
The experts supported their pessimist predictions with a bunch of reasons.
According to the Hans-Bröckler Foundation, in 2007, employees can actually pay less than in the previous year.
“The reason for this modest wage development, the increase in general traffic tax and the rapid rise in food and energy prices is the reason,” said Gustav Horn, a member of the Institute for Macroeconomic and Conjunctural Research.
In terms of unemployment insurance, there may also be additional burdens on workers.
In his statement to the “Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung” newspaper, Minister of Finance, Peer Steinbrück stated that the reduction in the right and reasonable unemployment insurance to 3.3% at the beginning of the new year.
In all cases, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be put in such a difficult position to apply for credit or support to the alliance, they quoted the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD politician.
It was known Tuesday that the price explosion of food and mineral products resulted in the highest inflation for 13 years.
In comparison, prices increased by a total of 3% per year.
Venus is the devil's twin brother.
Despite the harsh atmosphere of Venus, it is more similar to the Earth than it has been assumed so far: in its atmosphere, the European-Venus Express spacecraft discovered lightnings, and in the polar hemispheres discovered windmills such as those created in the winter on Earth.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that Venus is lightningking.
The European-Venus Express spacecraft has been providing evidence of electromagnetic waves on the surface of the atmosphere: The lightnings on Venus spread around 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Rusel, a member of the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to the famous theory, Earth life was caused by lightnings: According to the theory, the tyvadars launched reactions in the ocean that led to the development of the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If there was ever a life there, it could have been very early,” explained Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
At present, a living organism can hardly exist on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is hundreds of times denser than on Earth, and temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
“Venus may have been the hell’s twin brother of the earth, but still his twin brother,” he said.
The main question of Esa sending is why Venus, in its mass and size, is so similar to that of the Earth, is going on a completely different path of development.
The launch of “Venus Express” was a milestone in the study of Venus in November 2005, because since the beginning of the 1990s, no probe has been on its way to explore this planet.
According to researchers, the latest research results already presented in several Articles of Nature are not only evidence of the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
“They also support the fact that the similarities of the neighboring planet to the Earth are greater than we thought it would be,” Esa said.
In addition to the already known northern-sarcian rotation, researchers have also discovered a much faster skyrival on the southern corner.
The phenomenon resembles the air currents of the Earth's winter hemisphere, says the team led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The mass of the second inner planet of the solar system is almost the same as that of the Earth, with a diameter of 12.100 km, and almost as large as Earth.
The celestial body called the Evening Star will avoid the Sun in less than 225 days.
However, it turns a lot slower around its own axis: a Venus Day lasts 243 Earth Days.
Although the 460 Celsius-degree surface temperature of Venus with 92 bar pressure is barely reminded of the Earth, scientists begin to see that both planets were created in a completely similar environment.
Both of them had water built up, which remained as an ocean on Earth, while Venus went to the universe.
And while carbon dioxide on Earth was bound in carbon monoxide, it was a large part of the atmosphere in Venus.
Köhler takes Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama in defense of
Köhler, President of the German Republic, calls for the conclusion of a debate between the parties that broke out around the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellorial Office.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for attacking the Chancellor after the September reception.
German President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's authority and has called for the grand coalition to end a debate about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“In this question, we should not show ourselves as a divided nation towards the outside world,” Köhler said to the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler expressed his understanding that Angela Merkel had received the Dalai Lama in September.
“Human rights are universally valid to me even if I respect the diversity between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone is aware that Germany needs to take care of the foreign policy delicate balance, stressed the President of the Republic; however, Merkel, in defence of the accusation that the Chancellor would pursue a new Chinese policy.
“The Federal Chancellor did not break up with a traditional “China” policy.
China is also aware of this, he nailed Köhler.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister of Foreign Affairs (SPD), in an indirect manner, voiced the non-resistance of the Dalai Lama, and therefore became a target for attacks in the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's policy on foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Cancellary Office, heavy disturbances occurred in the German-China relationship.
Thus, not only did the Chinese leadership recall the invitation of German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to SPIEGEL's information, it also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the foreign ministers of the two countries.
Wen Jiabao’s Chinese Prime Minister has now called on the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that it was a mistake to accept the Dalai Lama.
China rejects European politicians accepting the Tibetan religious leader in their official quality, wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The works and words of the Dalai Lama have shown that they are trying to break out the further Tibetan territories including Tibet and other modern provinces from China.
Schäuble protects from disruptions similar to the French people
Street collisions with police, shootings, flaming cars: Wolfgang Schäuble protects from disruptions similar to the French people.
Everything must be done to avoid social dissatisfaction in Germany into street violence, demands the Federal Minister of Interior.
The barricades were flaming, the daters shot the police with a beer rifle: After the serious disruptions of the young people in France, the Federal Minister of Interior, Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is concerned with similar developments in Germany.
“We need to be careful that the social explosive does not accumulate and doesn’t go into violence.
We have to take it seriously,\" he said to the “Neue Presse” newspaper in Hanover.
Not all young people adapt to the rapid changes in social reality.
Unions, provinces and communities are currently working intensively on solving problematic cases, said Schäuble.
This is not only about the integration of immigrants.
“From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first successes have already been shown.”
However, it is too early to resolve the emergency.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that German suburbs had no urban and socio-economic problems like that in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris last night, young people fought serious street battles with the police.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were also lit.
In view of this, the federal government demanded a higher degree of activity in terms of integration, Kenan Kolat, the leader of the German Turkish Communities.
In relation to the disruptions in France, Kolat warned about the dangers of ‘repair’.
Although the situation in Germany is not as sensitive as in France,
But action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age from immigrant families was higher than the average.
There should be more educational places in front of all.
Kolat stressed: “We need to provide pespectiveness for young people.
However, the Turkish community leader added that \"social supervision within the family\" is much more present in Germany than in France.
In addition, many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built up here.
Colat warns: “But we must be bold.”
For young people, “the faster the opportunity to have a job and receive education” must be ensured.
Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Paris, Villiers-le-Bel, there was a total rest during the night.
Hundreds of policemen were ready to visit, and a helicopter was embroiderying the area with a spotlight.
The competent authorities reported on three arrests and a few flames and cars.
Since the report, a security unit of 1,000 people has taken care of the peace.
The police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, Mr Michelle Alliot-Marie announced his visit to the city.
During the night of the flooding on Tuesday, 80 police officers were wounded on a round due to the shocks of the wilders-le-bel.
The next night the riots spread to Toulouse.
The revolutions broke out in a traffic accident during which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
the Clouder Angela Empire
The action taken by the Chancellor from reality is proof that the coalition is going to end, and it is no longer expected.
In what country is the Federal Chancellor?
In the context of the general debate of the Bundestag, it is necessary to establish, in terms of its content, that it is not here, that it is not in the country whose governance would be his business.
Angela Merkel rejected the accusation with a very arbitrary sentence that she would be too focused on foreign policy.
It was provincial, replied, and in such a way it only gave the expression that he did not want to understand what his critics were talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, it made it clear to everyone how ingenious the warts are.
At the same time, neither particular interest nor empathy could be felt in the country’s problems.
Instead, Angela, the Resurrectionary, appears: a politician who has become a reality who is fleeing to foreign politics and is only a lack of certainty.
The example of climate protection: Heiligendammi boasts unrestrained praise for its borders, but he listens to how to achieve the objectives of climate change in the country.
In fact, as far as the self-respect is concerned, this kind of intolerance would not have been allowed by the CDU president two years ago.
Now he's getting into the fraternity that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
By doing so, he has gained good news as a pragmatic personality who solves problems instead of the flowers.
In Angela, however, there are only other things in the realm of domestic policy.
Child poverty and low-income problems?
This is just a few semi-says.
There is a lot of talk about how tight it is when it comes to family replacements.
Merkel has three times to stick around for a half-and-a-half-a-half-a-half.
If it's specific, it's in a foreign area.
The Roham Case Division
During the debate between the Republican presidential candidates on YouTube, the two favorites, Rudy Giulian and Mitt Romney had to be hit hard, and they should also be held from an external candidate.
The tension of the candidates has already surfaced on the first topic.
Mittt Romney says to his opponent, Rudy Giulian, that he made New York New York as “a rescue for illegal immigrants.”
“I would say that his own house served as a refuge for illegal immigrants,” Giuliani said, and that he was a former governor of Massachusetts’s eyes that he was employed as a private man for immigrants without documents.
The candidates are in a rush: As the Republican camp still has no single support for its practitioner, the eight Presidents will use the debate on CNN in front of everything to undermine the credit of their opponent.
Internet users have sent their own 30-second video broadcasts via Youtube, just as short as short reviews.
“With this type of Isolacionism, we brought Hitler to power,” says John McCain, under his opponent Ron Paul’s nose, who requires immediate withdrawal from Iraq as the only one of the participants of the circle.
Romney's head is also thoroughly washed by a veteran in Vietnam, who is attracted to condemning the so-called \"Waterboarding\" as a torture, the method of interrogation in which the flooding is simulated.
The important themes of the campaign, however, are set aside only in disputes about the tortures and tortures in Iraq, show the reactions of the Florida St. Petersburg public.
There is a loud grip in the room when Conservatives praise and reject future tax increases.
At the same time, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming more and more evident.
“I was wrong in the first place,” Romney says, “and apologizes to the supporters and television viewers for putting the voks down in 1994 while she was pregnant.
Giulian, on the other hand, is inspired to ask for a literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf
A day after the army's return, Musharraf, who exercised power in Pakistan, was defeated.
Eight years of military rule ends in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf's remaining five-year term of office took place on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcasts ceremony from the capital, the Islamic presidential palace.
Musharraf swore to the Constitution and to the benefit of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed his military office to his trust, Ashfaq Kiyan, and thus allowed the international pressure from all of the United States.
The former general, eight years after he broke into power in the form of a military coup, now reigns as a prime minister of state for the first time.
Musharraf, acting as Commander-in-Chief of Armed Forces, has complied with a fundamental demand of the West and the opposition.
Another important demand is the elimination of the exceptional condition, which Musharraf announced on 3 November.
According to Chief Prosecutor-General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will end the state of emergency by which he will meet a further demand for the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, in which Musharraf planted legal practitioners sympathizing at the beginning of November following the publication of the emergency status, has rejected every protest in the last week about the re-election of the Head of State on 6 October.
Meanwhile, as a result of an attack on a military consonant in Northern Pakistan, five soldiers were killed and four more injured.
According to information from the military spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road close to the border with Afghanistan.
Fathers of Krautrock are returning
The German Supergroup of the 70s: The three band members of Harmonia re-pressed their instrument to a Berlin concert.
On the occasion of the recapture, a cut recording appears from their age of light, “Life” in 1974.
At that time, they were much more known abroad.
The reported sensation is in person the body of the three agreed gentlemen around the dinner table.
Before each one of them, his own instrument, his own cable and his own buttons.
Dieter Moebius is in the middle of a snow white shirt with his 63 years of age.
Michael Roth, who has been a youth since the age of 57, will be accompanied by a laptop and guitar.
From the right side of the audience, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is curved and focused on the console.
Each of them produces some noise, and once and for all rhythms.
This sometimes involves some of the traditional music.
However, this does not seem to bother the masters in particular.
It was a great excitement for the composers of the krautrock musical direction that the Harmonia band again played music.
What we can tell you here: As a result of a proper follow-up, we can determine that the name has gone through the collective pop monument, but in no case has it left any lasting traces to be found that this band will be painfully missed after 32 years.
Why should the Germans not celebrate the legends of their 70s?
In particular, what we call \"crautrock\" is always appreciated more in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award to the still living members of the Cologne Can Group in 2003, the characters of the German pop were sitting in the room with an unconscious face.
When he thanked La Dusseldorf and Neu! in the Red Hot Chili Peppers table, he became unlimited to wonder.
At the concerts, Michael Roth was playing as an old buddy with Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage.
Domestic refusal and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
The memory has been overloaded by Harmonia because the trio existed for only two years, and during this time, it has had a far smaller impact than that of others.
Moebius and Roedelius have previously played with Conrad Schnitzler under the name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the basement under the Schaubühne Theatre in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, from economic considerations to a record company funded by the Church.
Roth helped the Kraftwerk band for a short time, and at the same time, the most radical German band, the Neu! guitarist, may have gained fame.
In 1973, Roth followed Cluster’s musicians into their exile at Weserbergland Forst.
There, in Alter Weserhof, a 16th-century Romba lived as a comedian fleeing the city.
Less ideologically than in communion I, where Roedelius was still in trouble as a babysitter.
Their lives are more of an idyllic artist.
According to the trash, the flag of the Harmonia Ottenstein dalárd was created and thus named their art was found.
Some of these things have been recorded by Harmonia.
The first album titled \"Musik von Harmonia\" and \"De Luxe\"
Despite his cool and humble music, the band suffered material needs.
The stock collection alone did not guarantee finding itself.
In 1974, the CD was recorded at a concert in Grissem, in front of a 50-person record audience, so someone remembers.
The effort and occasional practice of Harmonia was the idea of Roth at the time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band announced its dissolution in 1975.
Roth married to the esoteric and held himself from albums such as Flammende Herzen
Cluster was revitalized in the eightties, which has been more successful since then than harmony has ever been.
The live album of Griessem is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company, who was named Greenland, aimed to take care of krautrock as a special German supplement to live music.
In this context, Neu! was already promoted as the creation of Roedelius.
The resurrection of Harmonia will take place in the House of Berlin Cultures.
In public money, within the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, author of our British grandfather and the book \"Krautrock Sampler\" are also present.
There is also the ideamaker of the Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
This is about the impact of krautrock on the upcoming pop music era.
In this regard, Harmonia fills out the empty space reserved for the supergroup.
Brian Eno’s statement, along with the most unusual sounds, hangs in the room: “The only true music is his future.
There are images that show the producer in the room of a peasant with Harmony.
Other black and white photos of the Kusza cabled equipment serve the legendary construction.
In the foreground, the three veterans re-examine the improvisation.
This simply means that microphones are recorded for the organ and drum assembly with the intention of cheating the sound effects that have not yet been heard from the instruments of the instrument itself.
Today, electric music looks like electric music.
Three, a technique-bound jerk.
All of this does not change anything.
Barbara Morgenstern's leadership is coughing and bumping, and in a beautiful part, they're singing \"Aaaaaaaah.\"
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music colleges (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in pre-industrial and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone is crying out here, he doesn’t go in the wrong way, and that’s why Harmonia doesn’t let himself go out of his peace.
Even the most understandable thing you can think about on the stage.
Where does music start, and where does it end?
This can keep the person nervous, or you can give it up with the moments of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
Through the \"Warning and \"Mörderischer Frieden\", two films are repeatedly involved in the Balkan war.
However, none of them are convincing.
The basic idea, or too much action and shooting, or too emotional.
Even Richard Gere can’t help in “Warning.”
First of all, the good news: Although the two war criminals Karadzics and Mladics are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, there they found him again in the dark backland of the Bosnian war on Richard Gere.
In recent times, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 80s, because in the emotional films for women he played a number of good-boy-semble roles and a lot of press conferences on Buddhism even took our pleasure to look at it.
And look, once and for all, Richard Gere is the strongest argument that we may still have to look at the film “War”.
It offers a wonderful, smiling design: In principle, the Simon Hunt Military Scientist, which he created, was what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry were not so kind to it: A man who left his most beautiful years ago, but his decline as a destructive monument kept a significant part of his former charm.
However, the film \"Warning\" and the German-Mörderischer Frieden, which started this week, continue to produce only the endless series of the failed films of the Balkan war.
The “Mörderischer Frieden” film does not have much to say: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemel) who rescue a Serbian woman from the Kosovo snipers, and one of them suddenly loves a Serbian woman.
Although it is to be welcomed that the serbs are not represented as the sole cause of all bad things, the film that carries the nudity of television films is lost too quickly in shooting and event-like scenes.
“Cobra carries 11 to 5 characters instead of a highway with a war.
On the other hand, in the case of “Warship”, it is exemplary that no really good film has been made of the Balkan war.
The three U.S. military scientists, who are growing up to explore the Serbian war crimes, with other directors and other screenwriters (both in Richard Shepard’s personal union) in a different age, could have become a new “Apocalypse now”.
The stories show a surprising similarity: in both cases, small groups cut him into the forest to do what the army is unable to do – and in both cases, the journey to the madness is rounded.
One of the reasons for the fall of “War” is that it simply does not allow Simon Hunt to be a cynical person who is listening to his heart, as shown at the beginning.
No, and in the script, he even spends a romantic relationship with a woman who later killed Muslim witches.
The \"Warning\" will slide forever when reporters reach what Nato, CIA, and all the world's head hunters were unable to do in the last five minutes of the film: they will take the war criminal and hand him over to the Mohamedan Bosnians for fair revenge.
This is so bad that man would appeal to the Hague International Court of Justice for the crime committed against the logic of the cinema.
The goal of the film is profoundly human.
He wants to put him on the pelangere that Karadzics and Mladics are still on the loose and suspect the Americans and the French (presumably still united) that they do not continue persecution in a sufficiently intensive manner because of secret political deals.
But good and evil sometimes resemble each other so much that a famous Brecht version of man gets into mind.
In this poem, the poet writes about the famascism depicting the Asian demon on his desk: “I look at the dynasty octopus on my head, which tells me how exhausting it is to be.
Films such as “Warning” have the same oversized, man-shaped masks, which show how exhausting it is to be.
This problem is not limited to the genre of the Baltic War.
Recently, the newspaper reported that all Hollywood films about Iraq were a huge fall.
We can add that there has not yet been any good film about South Africa.
It’s almost always true: If a star moves around the world’s crisis bars or minefields, it’s like “In the pathways of freedom” with Patricia Arquette, “Without borders, Angelina Jolie, or the “Vercess Diamond” with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts may be too close to time.
For decades, Hollywood was able to film a good movie about the Holocaust with the “Schindler List” film.
There are probably a few films to come - because the works of the Vietnam war, which are now considered classic, such as \"the deer hunter\", \"Apocalypse now\" or \"Full Metal Jackett\", were not celebrated in their time as a concerted masterpiece.
But it can be imagined that today, when all mass killings come to our home in real time, immediately through two screens, we simply know too much about the world’s conflicts.
And it deprives screenwriters of ignoring reality that would be necessary to tell good stories.
“Being or not, or being a dictator, has finally succeeded so well because Lubitsch and Chaplin have not yet known how terrible the Nazi regime is.
Maybe you shouldn't try to be good if you want to make a good movie.
Perhaps we need to put the novelist Lawrence Norfolk in a sarcastically distant artistic view.
When the historical novel Lemprière-lexicon and the parallels between the Balkan war were plagued, he replied: “This only depends on certain things never changing.
The great cities will always be extremely dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and in Yugoslavia there will always be a war.
Von Beust is highly criticized for the withdrawal of the Olympic Games
The mayor's deportation of Hamburg's Summer Olympics proposal resulted in a strong criticism of political and economic life.
Many people want to keep fighting for water games.
Von Beust, however, warned of reality in the course of a chance.
On Wednesday, the head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, declared the withdrawal to be “unfavorable to the economic environment.”
No other project has released such huge motivation forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, we cannot maintain a level playing field in sport”
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative to \"start from the revised time coordinates\".
In addition to his previous statements, Mayor Ole von Beust said that his ambitions for the Olympic Games in Hamburg were not realistic by at least by 2028.
“It’s not Hamburg’s decision on the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Association,” von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He was expected to make a decision by the Sports Association at the beginning of December 2018 on the Munich application for the Winter Olympic Games.
“Our preference for this means that we will not have real chances within the period of 2028 that we have considered so far.”
However, we do not give up the dream, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) expressed his regret at von Beust’s statements.
This makes the impression that Hamburg will not compete for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to take a chance to bury our plans,” said Günter Ploß, president of HSB on Wednesday.
In addition, the withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement made by the Senate president at the General German College Sports Association.
There, Von Beust Hamburg’s 2015 proposal was described as not a substitute for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The College of Sports only launched Hamburg as a city participating in the competition last week.
The civilian group of the SPD called on the Senate to leave valuable time for the construction of the apartment in Hamburg unexploited.
“Kleiner Grasbrook has been delaying the development of the Senate for years, because he was sitting next to the Olympics and dismounted the building,” said two SPD-representatives Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD was constantly breaking the flame alongside an integrated plan for the Olympic and later home use of Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU focused on the \"event factor\" unilaterally.
The 2012 Summer Olympics bid was a great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg has failed Lipcsén.
These are not Warhol's files.
The one who connects the concepts of Sweden and the wall is Ikea and thinks not of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Today, villages in Sweden are putting dark shadows on the list of Warhol’s works.
The ninety-four-Stockholm types listed here are a large part of the Brillo Box fake.
After a few months ago, the Swedish newspaper \"Expressen\" challenged the originality of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo Box, the internal investigation of the Stockholm Moderna Museet resulted in a predictive result: The former museum director Pontus Hultén, who donated six copies to Moderna Museet in 1995, and most likely, a hundred more \"Stockholm-types\" in the international art market.
The history is a long and complicated chain of artistic and curatorial scenes.
Warhol was founded in 1964 in New York, the first \"Brillo Boxes\" - painted walls based on the red-blue-white format of the \"Brillo\" soap powder cardboard box.
In a 1968 exhibition in Moderna Museet - Warhol's consent - the hundreds of Brillo Boxes were produced from a cardboard: They were not from Warhol for cost saving reasons, but were delivered directly from the Brillo Carton Factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their templates, simple pieces of exhibition.
At the same time, Warhol gave permission to produce some Brillo trees in Sweden in 1968, which were not issued in Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the age now speak about fifteen boxes that were then certified as Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the designation ‘Stockholm type’.
Some of them were sold for more than $100,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director, later claimed that in 1968, a hundred villages were produced and produced in Sweden, which was then left in Warhol.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for a holy-Petervár exhibition in Malmö.
At this time, however, Warhol has been dead for three years.
In addition to the six Brillo Box owned by the Museum, Lars Byström also examined three private-owned boxes in Sweden, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The printed box was first painted and polished, followed by the white oil paint.
On the contrary, the structure of copies from 1990 reveals that the paint was taken directly into the moldboard without foundation, not only oil, but also acrylic paints.
\"These boxes were not certified by the artist, so they should be deleted from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo's Box,\" Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet says, \"Unless the New York 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' decides otherwise, the Moderna Museet will list the six boxes in his collection as a copy/issue material.
The Authentication Board, of course, announced in June that he was investigating “several charges” against soapy boxes.
Since then, however, they have been indisputable listening.
Manila rebel soldiers give up
They gave up the rebellion in the Philippines, the soldiers who barricades themselves at a hotel in Manila, and demanded the failure of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He can't take responsibility for the bloodshed, he told reporters at the hotel their leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud.
Before that, government-wide soldiers who used light gas attacked the hotel.
The two dozen soldiers have been barricades in the building for hours.
Half of the team stood before the court on Thursday due to the failed coup attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly solve the wheel with 30 sympathizers.
The military police on the man's guard clearly moved to him and joined the reclamation.
They penetrated the Peninsula-Hotel, and then they demanded the failure of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government-friendly units have closed the area of the hotel.
The president invited the security cabinet to an extraordinary meeting.
Security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the military procedure.
“They’re tired of people,” Trillanes said.
“We call upon people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who was previously commander of the Scout Rangers movement, said that the other units of the army wanted to join the journey within a short time.
The government critics called for a strong protest against the president on Friday.
The government has been shadowed by corruption charges several months ago.
Manila's financial district was the main stage in 2003 in the army's experiment against Arroyo organized by 200 members.
The uprising failed almost 24 hours later, when the army was reluctant to join.
Since 1986, at least seven coup attempts have been made in the Philippines against democraticly elected governments.
The United Internet will be a capitalist in Versatel
The United Internet has more than 20% of its share in Versatel’s telecommunications company.
As the company said Wednesday evening, the average price per share is 14,46 Euro.
This represents an equity of 20.05 percent.
Before that, inventions have been made.
The possibility of raising the portion of the property acquired in Versatel remains open.
By this step, they want to promote the consolidation of the German DSL market, according to the United Internet.
Prior to this, on Wednesday, some assumptions were made about possible engagement after the Berenberg Bank increased its share of the Düsseldorf network service provider by an additional 5% to 15.1 percent.
The financial institution maintains the share only as a third party and is reported on the financial market.
On the previous day, the United Internet already owned a narrow 10% of the Drillisch mobile company.
During the capital increase, Drillisch invested 17.4 million new shares in the value of EUR 106.4 million.
The United Internet bought 5,15 million shares for €31,4 million.
In addition, companies have launched a dialogue on cooperation in the market for DSL and mobile products.
“We will strengthen our partner’s relationship,” said a spokesperson of the United Internet.
The two companies jointly established the MSP Joint Undertaking to take over the competitor Freenet.
The two companies are satisfied with a good 10% stake in Freenet and do not have the right to take over another 18,49% of Freenet, said on Thursday the United Internet.
However, the two companies leave all the opportunities open, in particular to increase the share acquired in Freenet AG, the news says.
Negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet were concluded in mid-November.
The poker game around Freenet has been a part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contractual mobile phone clients and 1.27 million DSL and fixed access clients.
The United Internet and Drillisch holding company have so far had a direct 6,01% share in Freenet.
It is now agreed that Drillisch will bring a further round of four percent.
An agreement on the right to purchase 18,49% of the Vatas investment company was reached in August.
