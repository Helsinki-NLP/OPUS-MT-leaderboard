Four members of the Kemerovo Group were arrested in Estonia and Spain.
According to the Postman, the police held Slava Gulevitch, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo Group operating in Spain, known as Slava Kemerovsky in the criminal world.
Gulevitch was arrested in Spain with the permission of the court.
Three suspects arrested in Estonia were also arrested by the court yesterday.
It is suspected that the so-called Kemerovo criminal community is 27-57 years old, who mainly commit drug crimes.
In the province of Malaga in Spain, the alleged leader of the criminal association was detained in Mijas.
Three men were suspected in Estonia, one of them was collected according to the data of the chief figure of the criminal association and two are members of the criminal community.
The data collected indicate that the tasks and roles clearly shared in the criminal community.
The aim of the criminal community was to commit drug crimes, and thus to earn criminal income, the chief of the pre-trial proceedings in criminal matters, Mr. Vahur Verte, state prosecutor.
“We do not exclude the growing circle of suspects in this criminal matter,” the prosecutor added.
These are people who have had an interest in law enforcement agencies, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
“Integrity cooperation has become common to us and this week’s operation shows the success of cooperation,” said Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said that the pre-trial investigation for nearly a year and a half of detention was preceded by detention.
“In the first half of the area, long-term work was realized and we held suspects in the crimes in Estonia and Spain at the same time,” he said.
He added that the Central Criminal Police officers were helpful when they were arrested in Spain.
For years, we have good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and civil card forces.
These arrests are another message to criminals that we can catch them from the other end of Europe,\" Leis said.
The information collected so far clearly indicates that in the presence of freedom, men suspected may continue to commit new crimes, so the prosecutor sought their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia.
In order to ensure confiscation in this criminal case, property, vehicles and cash are seized.
Pre-trial proceedings in criminal matters are conducted by the Central Criminal Police Office and led by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevish in 2005 and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevitch was considered to be the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after his underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, emerged in the underworld of Estonia in the early 1990s when he began to engage in blackmail in Tallinn.
He claimed to have taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes at different hotels and demanded monthly roofing tax on businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscation of criminal income and rulings that have entered into force confirm that the fight in organised crime is effective.
For example, the last judgments, so-called Dikajev, accused of eight criminal cases in the criminal community of the so-called Dikajev, from whom the criminal income of 80 000 euros was confiscated, or the judgment against nine persons that Igor Aleynikov established a criminal association in 2006 aimed at illegal trafficking in secret cigarettes and the execution of crimes related to trafficking in human beings in Eastern Estonia and South Estonia.
The amount of the consolidated criminal income is almost EUR 71,500.
In these criminal cases, success has ensured that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, carry out operations in any country of the European Union.
The Group of Civil Rights warns Missouri of travelling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri about discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state.
The Group’s statement states: “The NACP travel note, issued for the state of Missouri, valid until August 28, 2017, invites all African American travellers, visitors and missionaries to be particularly attentive and highly cautious when moving around the state, taking into account the suspicious racial events of the entire race that have taken place in recent times over the state and have been announced here.
According to the NACP, the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning so recent Missouri Act, which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination, as well as the fact that there are unequally few targets for lawmakers in the state.
“People’s rights are violated.
They are pulled to the road edge because of their skin color, beaten or killed,\" said the president of the NACP Missouri branch Rod Chapel on The Kansas City Star.
“We’ve never had so much complaints before.”
This is the first such warning issued by the organization for the U.S. state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults towards black students at Missouri University and Tennessee, the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year in suspicious circumstances after he got out of the state running through gas and was arrested by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
In addition, the note refers to the recent report by the chief prosecutor Missouri, which shows that black driver cars are suspended in the state at 75% more likely than the whites' own.
“It is important for people to be aware and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouris,” Chapel said.
“People must be prepared, whether it means taking bail or informing relatives that they are going through the state.”
Based on the latest data from the FBI hate crime reporting program, in 2015, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouris, which places the number of crimes similar to those of the state at 16 locations.
Travel security is also a response to Missouri’s new law, which makes it difficult for the company to be brought to court in the search for housing or work for discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes about Texas and Arizona after these states adopted immigration laws that obliged locals to arrest people for immigration violations, as ACLU said it increases racial profiling.
Usually, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides travel warnings about other countries, but recently interest groups have started using this measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends in the United States.
Hepatitis: What could everyone know about the various forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis, i.e. inflammation of the liver, may be caused by five different hepatitis viruses - A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C is at a low cost, which can further develop into liver cirrhosis, i.e. liver wrinkles and liver cancer.
The Health Board's epidemiology adviser Hearo Kutsar says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gray stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowness of skin and mucous membranes.
The last sign of the disease also comes from the folk name of inflammation of the liver.
In children, hepatitis may develop without symptoms.
Different types of inflammation of the liver can only be determined based on laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can convert to chronic hepatitis and go through decades without symptoms, which means that a person may not know anything about a liver-damaged disease.
Hearing Kutsar brings out various forms of hepatitis and describes their course more closely.
The hepatitis viruses spread from a sick person and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, by means of an infected person's stools on his hands and hands on food, surfaces, objects, mouths, and the consumption of drugs.
The risk of hepatitis infection, or the risk group, includes family members and caregivers of the affected person, people with chronic liver disease, people with an infection, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travellers visiting countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
The infection can be prevented in vaccines, in particular in people who travel a lot and at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet the daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect the hand, wash all fruits and vegetables before taking food.
B hepatitis viruses spread in the presence of a sick person in the blood, in the injection of drugs, in tattoo, in August, in the use of blood-contaminated olemetes (scarries, carnations), in the use of donor blood, in the sexual intercourse with a person of a hepatitis, and in the use of a hepatitis patient from the mother to the foetus/reborn.
B The risk group for hepatitis infection involves injecting narcotics, sex partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, sick family members and carers, healthcare, rescue workers and police officers and travellers visiting countries with high rates of hepatitis B infection.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is recommended that people at risk be vaccinated, in particular those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and people with diabetes.
Other prevention measures for hepatitis B include: preventing the use, tattoo and extension of foreign hygiene and manicure tools, other sharps and syringe needles, and the use of condoms in case of infectious sex or preventing sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national vaccination plan and free of charge for children.
C hepatitis viruses spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, by injection of drugs, by tattooing, Augusting, by the use of blood-polluted domestic forests, blood donor blood, sex with a hepatitisc person, and from a hepatitis patient to a mother/a newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection involves injecting narcotics, sex partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, family members and carers, health, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, HIV infected persons and travellers visiting countries with high rates of hepatitis C disease.
C The prevention measure for hepatitis is: preventing the use, tattoo and extension of foreign hygiene and manicure tools, other sharps and syringe needles, and the use of condoms in the case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
D hepatitis is caused by a hepatitis D virus that is multiplied by the presence of hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D is present in patients with chronic hepatitis B co-infected with hepatitis B or superinfection.
D hepatitis viruses spread in contact with blood and other body fluids, with contaminated syringe needles, sexually transmitted and rarely infected mothers to the foetus.
D The risk group for hepatitis is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and non-immunities of hepatitis B.
Effective prevention measures are vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with hepatitis D virus.
These hepatitis viruses spread on the fecal-oral route with drinking water and food, including low-heated beef, fish and marine carpentry, donor blood, co-used syringes and infected mothers to the foetus.
Passengers may be infected in countries with high rates of hepatitis E.
The prevention measures of hepatitis are to comply with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after the care of the patient.
Fruit and vegetables wash before consumption, avoid eating low-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
Although in the last round the competitors tried to push a four-time Olympic winner off the track, the 34-year-old Farah found strength at the end of the race and won the 26.49,51.
Farah didn’t think long, bringing Tania and the children along the path after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I really miss my family.
Being on the track with them was wonderful, Farah told the journalists.
Farah targets the fifth title race in London with a golden double of 5000 and 10,000 meters.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor-Daam in Gold. The masterpiece of Gustav Klimt, the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, is a unique story, from the birth story of one of the works of art to a much deeper cultural history of the late 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.
But even more thorough history.
It would have been a bit harder for the information to be used, or a narrower cutting stone, a narrower theme would have allowed the portrait allowed in the title to get more influence on the extraordinary story.
There are now two books between one cover: Gustav Klimt and his painting, \"Daam in gold,\" portrayed the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a much bigger and more comprehensive history book of respected Jewish families and German occupations in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the middle of a pulsating Vienna cultural life, and those who were themselves in the capital of Austria can hardly imagine how more than a hundred years ago living around Ringstrasse, or how all the heads of the Central Cafe turned in when Climt came in.
The concentration of cultural characters was high in one of Europe’s richest cities, and when you see a book, you feel more culturally like a gram.
At the same time, Sigmund Freud acted in a city where there was an incurable syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, as if there was nothing to do with the development of the story.
Or perhaps, every pair of pints will add colors to the cultural life of the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of a journey to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
In the turn of the century, almost every tens of the population of Vienna was Jewish.
Adele’s parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice to open up the Czech sugar magnade with Ferdinand Blochi and to Climt for his famous paintings, his father’s bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet's whole life, where he belonged, was not drawn.
When you look at \"Dam's gold, it's hard to believe that life's end-of-life infection was this great woman's socialism and dreamed of her journey to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his wife from Klimtilt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
At that time, Klimt’s order cost 4,000 kroons, a quarter of the price of a well-placed land house.
The fact that some portraits suspected a master’s love story with a model, the sugar magnate did not drop.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist created during the work continued until the end of life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - \"Daam in Gold.
Gustav Klimt’s masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer’s portrait, is an extraordinary story, Varrak 2016, translated in English by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before the start of the work with Adele, Klimt had gone to the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, and the researchers believe that the brilliant mosaics of the emperor Theodora, just seen there, gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele painted as a mosaic.
Klimt presented his \"Dam's Gold\" in Vienna in 1908 and about the same time (in 1907-1908) was born in the second golden country.
The art historians did not notice the similarity of two women.
How is Hitler related to the story?
“I think I owe my friend Klimt to make his hand work available to the public,” wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer for a few years after leaving the artist (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family’s Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimtil had made another portrait of Adele.
In his will, too, Adele left in February 1925, he asked his wife to leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscape paintings to the Austrian Gallery.
She inherited her jewelry to her sisters Maria and Luis.
A year later, when Klimt had completed the “Austrian Mona Lisa,” he had tried to get to the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, Adolf Hitler, 17 years old, but failed to draw.
Although Hitler’s later anti-Semitism is sometimes considered to be the reason that the Jewish professors did not accept him to the academy, none of his examers were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in the Maria Testament, had changed significantly by 1939 – had become important for finding the works of the Nazi Party of the rich Jewish collections of Vienna.
Hitler’s personal art property also included some of Adele’s work at home, but not Klimt’s.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery began a ten-year trial between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauers heirs.
It should be noted here that if “Suudus” is seen in Vienna’s Belvedere Castle, then Adele Bloch-Bauer’s “Dam’s Gold” should be seen in the New York Neue Gallery.
And before driving to Vienna, read the book.
Even if you go to Klimt's work to see no plan, because at least my emotions rotated after closing the book more Nazi and Jewish themes than a $135 million painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much portrait, rather than the story of the fate of the family - and a very touching story.
Surprisingly, the group of Bauers presented at the beginning of the book facilitated the orientation of events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In life, Gold was very close to the personal record of his 200 m of cell swimming.
The Tipmark comes from the 17-year-old peak from the back of the week when the Canadian Junior Championships reached 2.16.58, broadcasts the Priit Avik Swimming Blog.
Gold was the last one, or the tenth A-Final.
At the final he passed the distance time of 2.15,76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful top brand.
Alina Kendzior’s Estonian record (2.15.13) remained a little over half a second apart from Gold.
At the top of all time in Estonia, Gold rose to the third, and his fresh personal top mark is the fifth result of all time in Estonia.
The young hope for the future is still 100 m, 200 m and 400 m of freedom and 200 m and 400 m of complexing.
Last week, the Canadian Championships took place in Toronto, and Gold also made a successful start there.
He won 200 m of free swimming with a silver medal of 2.03.22.
This was the last time it was swimmed in 2008.
From Gold faster than ever, this distance in Estonia has only been swimming with Estonian record queen Elina Partitõka.
The Canadian Estonians still won the bronze medal in 100 m of freedom with an excellent personal record and the new Estonian season’s top brand 56.66.
For example, a year older than Kertu Ly Alek has been swimming this distance just one century faster.
Up to the top of the person, he reached the time of the 100 m in the motion for information in the opening hours.
At a half-long distance, he only reached the seventh place when he was swimming at the final 2.17,31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season's ranking at four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen teeth
Holiday time is in hand - it means relaxation for President Donald Trump of the United States.
However, since Trump has been the president for the most part of his holiday days, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to U.S. Today and CNN, the President's plan is to spend a 17-day vacation in his own golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the President's holiday began yesterday, Trump's opponents have already spoken about the issue of leave for a week.
They're giving Trump a lot of rest.
The president has the habit of spending the weekend in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villas.
In other words, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196th term of office.
George W. Bush, for example, had been on vacation for 67 days, and Barack Obama was half less than Trump, but only 21 days.
But Trump's going to have to lose things quickly.
Counted days after becoming president, Trump said “60 minutes” that there would be no time for long vacations during his gardener, because there was a lot of need to be done.
Three years ago, he also expressed his resentment about Barack Obama’s holiday.
The current president wrote on Twitter: “When Obama is on vacation, golf, party and jazz concerts are playing, ISIS’s reporters are cutting their heads off.”
According to White House officials, the 17-day golf club visit is not a real relaxation.
It is officially called a holiday, during which Trump does not have time for reading or other entertainment activities.
In addition, there was another reason to leave work.
The White House, in the West, replaces the condition system, and therefore the entire staff had to leave.
There are also Ovaal Cabinets and other working rooms of the President in the West.
“I don’t think anyone else would like to be in the West in August if there were 38 degrees and no condition,” White House spokesman Lindsay Walters said.
From where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you will get the idea of a video.
Blocking critics from Facebook Do not apply to the government if you do not tolerate the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew so much about the negative media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers didn’t go long to start bothering him for everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Criticism, of course, irritates him.
But he didn't make his critics shut up.
Because in 1783, Washington said that “the freedom of speech can be taken away from us, and in dark and silent silence, we can be guided by sheep like sheep.”
This brings me to Governor Larry Hogan, Maryland, who has to struggle to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted at least 450 posts published on his official Facebook page.
And at the beginning of the week, the American Civil Freedom Union complained about it.
The Governor’s official was emptying the action and the web-commendations piled up against the reactions in the style, “Who cares?”
“It’s just Facebook,” many said.
But it does matter.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an amazingly popular Republican governor in a state of democracy.
Its percentage of approval is among the 50 governors of the country in the second place.
Hogan is not an unthinkingly responsive tuning head.
He has led the state on a firm hand and remained strictly determined by his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as a major tool in communicating with his constituents, for example, by presenting after chemotherapy for the first time a lazy head of his helmet.
Thus, the Governor’s page, which is a public forum with official labelling, is managed by blocking people visiting the taxpayers’ dollars and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's press representative Amelia Chase defended the conduct of the Governor in an interview with The Washington Post, claiming that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderatoring.
But it is too easy to paint a picture of online roles, spammers or hate full of people.
The Post talked to a number of real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that is what they are, they are real people who interact with their chosen leaders. Teacher, company owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not obscene.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, pushing Hogan to Catholicism.
The lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, did not encourage anger, but rather hate crimes.
“I was politely convinced that I was disappointed because he had not responded to hate crimes or other recent news,” he wrote in The Post’s Newspaper comment.
“I also don’t like the idea that if a lot of people comment on the same subject, some immediately call it a collective effort, rather than admitting that it is a great deal of concern with citizens.”
What the governor’s official called “directed spam attack” would probably call it “public support.”
Facebook time allows you to easily match messages by blocking just a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It’s much cleaner than the old age when the workers had to be sent out for the same purpose, so that they would collect and burn the newspapers with critical guides, or arrest the protesters, and force them to silence.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official to be criticized for having been bitten by Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have blocked his Twitter stream.
One of the first marked judgments on this issue was made in Virginia last week.
US District Judge James C. Cacher, Alexandria, decided that the president of the district supervisory board of Loudoun violated the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
Kentucky visited ACLU on Facebook and Twitter after the use of Governor Matt Bevinit (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, affordable postage costs were similar to those on the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800 quadrupled the number of newspapers and anonymous writers embezzled his way of guidance.
And even then, Washington had to fight anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers from pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington’s decisions to the country.
According to historical documents collected in the framework of the online George Washington letter collection project, he was buried in the cabinet of petitions that criticized his views on the friendship, trade and shipping agreements concluded with the UK.
But he didn't make them shut up.
Freedom of expression, special opinions and discussions are the foundations of our country.
And the right management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty expects the comfort of the home area at the Renaissance Club
The former European pre-number Ronan Rafferty is dedicated to the comfort of the home area within the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the East Lothiani Renaissance Club Golf Courses.
The Northern Irishman, who was in charge of the last round on the Archerfield Links trails in the neighborhood last year before Paul Eales was taken down, has been fond of the new venue and performs the role of the team founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad, instead of the ambassador.
“I see how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we see how the club shines with this event in full glory,” Rafferty said.
“The masters see the track in their best form, it’s in a brilliant state.
Jerry has done a great job building this place.
He is an enthusiastic supporter of the golf game and feels proud of what he has achieved here.
It allows the track to be excellently presented –
English Eales is looking forward to defending the championship for the first time, although he has won both European Tour and European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
“It’s a very special feeling,” said a player who is nesting in Southport.
“I couldn’t protect my Extremeura Open because it was taken off my winning calendar a year later.
Magic is coming back to this area.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, the winner of last year was special.
It was a very special time that we will always wear in the heart.
Gary Orr, who joined the European Tour of Seniors at the beginning of the year, will return to the competition again.
This is his first event in Scotland after participating in Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“To play at home is always a little more important,” said Helensburg’s man Orr.
“You want to perform well, but you also feel the extra tension.
I have once again enjoyed playing with a lot of pleasure and a pretty decent golf game.
I am satisfied with the way things go so far.
The former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty will join the Trio field.
The Orr and the former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance are two of the six scooters in the race, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir, and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge, and parking a car with one passenger costs 5 pounds and 10 pounds for a car with two or more passengers.

Poverty and death in the land of Indonesia
When Bardina Dege's dinner is prepared, she doesn't use a stove.
He even uses pot rarely.
In a wooden house in Enarotal, the capital of the Panian province of Indonesia, a domestic housewife in local language places a bet called nota directly at the fire station.
After half an hour, the coaled tuber will be taken from the fire and washed with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor with no furniture, and he also does his daily household chores, for example, washing the clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sex.
The role of the toilet is filled with a bucket in the room without roofing.
Since he is the youngest of four women, he is not assigned to take care of any land.
Polygamia is common here.
However, working late can be dangerous for most of the village's men, and many of them drink hard, and there are also soldiers here.
“No one dares to walk around the village after five o’clock in the evening,” he says.
It is a rare sight to survive in the mountainous land of Papua. It is the former Dutch colony, which was annexed to Indonesia in 1969, after the absence of a referendum, during which only 1026 seniors were forced to vote under the eyes of the occupation forces.
The movement in the direction of liberation from the Netherlands has encouraged its rages quickly against the Jakarta government, which remains under its strong control, preventing foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, so that the independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island.
Enarotal is also a remote and abandoned place. To get here, you need to fly from the capital of the province from Jayapara to Nabire for 90 minutes and then pass a five-hour journey with the rental car.
There is no public transport.
About 19,000 inhabitants of the city are made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo tars and covered by waves of iron roofs, which roses have turned into different shades of yellow.
Very few Indonesians have taken the journey here, not to mention journalists, nor have there been almost any foreigners here.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the popes of Mee Pago worshipped the god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing such clothes,” Degei says, referring to our color-creeped hand-knitted turbine, dark blouse, and bright skirt.
“Before that, we carried only plant leaves on the body.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of people living below the poverty limit, and statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are among the worst in Asia.
This is also a gold-rich country in Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Pania, the mountainous province of New Jersey, is the world's largest and most profitable gold mine Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015, Freeport extracted about $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be threatened with supplies of consumer wood, estimated at $78 billion.
However, these riches are the source of the sufferings of the popes, as they lead to a stifling presence of the powerful Indonesian military.
The New York Times’ 2005 study showed that Freeport paid around US$20 million to local military and military personnel from 1998 to 2004.
The efforts of the popes to ensure greater autonomy threaten this goldhane and they are fervently transformed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 popes have been killed since 1969 and thousands more Indonesian troops have raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Committee on Human Rights, the mass killing of genocide in the Mountains of the Papua tribes in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year, over 3900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Indonesian police.
The 2016 report of the Bishops of Brisbane, “We will lose everything – contains evidence of the brutality committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial execution, torture (one report says rape and the release of electric shocks) and the brutal suppression of peaceful protests.
“It’s hard to read the number of victims, because such incidents occur every week,” says Andreas Harsono, a Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screws are even tighter because the natural resources of Papua have caused the influx of new settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the population of the province is Christians, but demographics are changing, as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the Indonesian nations of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes.
Japanese family dishes sell gado-gado with crispy and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
Locals cannot compete with them.
“Migrands began to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market more cheaply than local papayas,” explains Abeth You, born in Pania, who moved to Jayapara, the capital of the province for work.
\"Fathers of oil-backed beans papaya Mama-mama's [Women] are therefore losing their market share\"
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is known as Jokowi, promised to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua in his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter won on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace from the 29 electoral districts of Papua 27, including Pania.
But there are very few changes in Papua, and the locals feel disappointed.
“Our hearts are broken, because in 2014, we voted for Jokowi in the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes of restoring justice,” says You.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi’s entry into office in October, the Pania was in a low state.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotti sang a Christmas song at the fire when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on the motorcycle from darkness.
They told them that they should turn on the lights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers reached their voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, the drunk soldiers were chasing the kids and beating them with their gun handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby election committee building was set to burn, and the next day things were escalating.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered for justice in the football field in front of the local police station and the military control centre.
They carried the ceremony yachts and presented the papua mee pago tribe of waita dance, during which they ran around and emulated the bird song.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police and the military.
In the event of an ailment, soldiers were given an order through an internal radio station. “When the crowd shows more than three times the resistance, they were shot down, according to the official document that was seen in the magazine TIME, but not issued to local media publications.
The elder in the city of Enarotal Kego Koto in Yeemias Kayame (56) felt a threat and called for peace to be preserved, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
“At the turn of the turn, I was suddenly shot at the left wrist,” he told the magazine TIME in his bright colors on the porch of the wooden house.
Kayame still doesn’t know who the shooter was, but says the moon came from the gathering of soldiers.
“There was a lot of money, plenty of fire,” he added.
Local man Alfius Youw got shot three times by his cousin.
“I ran to him and studied his body to make sure it was with him,” TIME wrote in a syndicated Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, used only one name.
\"I saw him dead... I kissed him...
Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that he would only be subject to the security of his department because it was attacked.
“We need to protect ourselves when we are threatened to be killed,” said Commissioner Pudjo Sulstiyo, a spokesman for the Papua police in 2015.
“This is the question of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and were heavily injured.
The news of the killings arrived in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapura had a passionate speech in which he expressed compassion to the families of the victims and promised to deal with abuse in Papua.
“I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would establish an external mechanism to resolve crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately the excuses were also followed.
“Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the early 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes,\" he said.
Speaking to TIME on June 5th, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying that he has no intention of creating a mechanism for dealing with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said that “all things will be resolved by law.”
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Papua, including in Pania.
The families of the victims of Pania accepted such claims with a gloom of gloomy.
“I have been questioned four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made,” Yohanes said.
“I’m tired.”
He says he still lives in fear for years later.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
\"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot.\"
His brother Yacobus confirmed that the people of Panama were afraid to break this incident.
He said he had been beaten by the army after he had helped four victims to bury him.
“After the funeral of the dead, the army came to look for me,” he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the village residents in Deiya, a neighboring state in Panama.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when a conflict occurred between the villagers and the head of the construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This man population, a 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, drowned in the fish fishing for the nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
The hateful villagers protested on the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to police, the villagers threw the police with stones that the latter responded with warning shots.
But according to the locals, the Mobile Brigade (Indonesia military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
“We were in a big panic, we were afraid of revenge,” TIME told the 29-year-old Dominggu Badi, who lived near the hospital and saw the injury coming.
“I’ve been hiding in my house for two days.
Deiyai Parliament has called for police officers to be held accountable for the matter and for the police to withdraw the mobile Brigade from the region.
Pania has always been a problematic place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thought-out development nourishs the dissatisfaction of honey, many, Dan and Damal tribes living in the central mountainous region of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) army of rebels, which, according to them, defends the rights of the popes by organising attacks and kidnapping attacks among Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL leaders are from Pania, including Tadius Yog and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the military “to protect the sovereignty of the state” has arrested thousands of people in Pania in pretext over the past few years.
Some of them never show up again.
Papua people are known as Paniaid as a “tragical forgotten place”
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
The small rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive to buy for locals.
The bread is just as unreachable.
People grow their whole food themselves mainly in the Batat, in addition to a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Flameing is the work of women, each of whom is able to care for four or five bats.
They usually keep most of the harvests for the family, the rest sell on the local market.
Ten Batats cost only 10,000 Indonesian Rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities between the indigenous popes and the new migrants, who have since the opening of the new routes at Nabire Airport, have been increasing.
These few jobs that exist are better suited to educated and more prosperous migrants.
Popes often lack capital or the necessary skills to run a competitive business.
“No young people are interested in visiting because there is no job or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the board of the Panic tribes.
The separation keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
In addition, foreign media is subject to severe restrictions.
By the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were sent out of Papua, as “they did not follow the relevant practices,” although they had been given a rare filming permit.
According to Vice President of the Human Rights Watch Asia Department, Phelim Kine has not implemented Jokowi's electoral promises to eliminate restrictions on transparency and development.
“Indonesia, journalists trying to make reports from the most unrested provinces and West Papua in Papua, New threats to the rejection of the visa and the inclusion of the black list are threatening the new threats,” he said in a statement.
The lack of a view of journalism means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the neighboring neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries in Tonga, Nauru, Belarus, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands encouraged the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “a number of widespread crimes in Papua, including the shooting of Panama.”
These same countries have also historically supported the VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, rejected the charges of the group, saying Jakarta told journalists: “Indonesia is still subject to democratic order and freedom of the press, so that the evidence of human rights cases is difficult to bury.
Local people want to see more foreign governments.
When the Dutch official delegation presided over the country’s human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar on May 4, Jayapurat visited, the local people stopped meeting, but anonymous, according to the source who wanted to remain anonymous, asking, “We want freedom.”
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but the popes do not believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of the Pania,” said Hobai, chairman of the council of tribes.
He wants Jokowi to understand that, in addition to the fact that the people of Pania are constantly living under the threat of a predatory army, they are in trouble because of the vicious educational and health services of the war.
According to Gobai, the people of Panama, as well as other popes, consider their voice to be a debt to Jokowi, which he must pay.
“They don’t need money, they want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and fear, the families of the Panic shooting victims were able to make their last search for a symbolic counterattack, they buried one of the victims in a police station and a land opposite the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be placed on a foot, they will not allow at least the responsible to forget their crimes.
“One of our family members was killed,” Yacobus says.
“What else can we do?
the Dubai Torch Cloud Breaker for the second time.
On Friday, one of the world’s highest residential towers in Dubai, forced hundreds of residents to escape from this 337-metre height and 79-story building.
This is the second fire that has been destroyed in just two years by a high-rise called Torchi, or Torviku Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injury was reported and no direct cause of the fire was reported.
“We slept and woke up to the fire alarm and the screaming of people.
We ran down the stairs, and we took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,\" Reuters told a resident who called himself George.
According to the Dubai Civil Protection Officers, the firefighters deleted the flame at about 4 a.m. at local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working for the victims to secure the shelter.
This incident may again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surface of high-rise buildings around the world.
During the investigation carried out after the 2015 fire of Torch Board, it was found that the most damage was the fascists - decorative panels and insulation of the outer surface.
The British police have said that they believe that London’s Grenfeld Tower isolation and fascade panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire in June, where about 80 people were killed.
See: These phones probably get sales houses in the fall
Spring and autumn is a sweet time for technical fans, because then phone manufacturers publish their new top models.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10, and Sony Xperia XZ Premium were sold, and in the fall there are new hit phones waiting for the poets.
According to the Marketing and Sales Director of Tele2 Kristjan Seema, this year’s flagship is characterised by innovative design, eye-catcher, edge-side 4K resolution screen and high-speed processor.
Samsung Galaxy S8 has produced great excitement in the world of technology, which has also reached the front of the Estonian smartphone sales table.
In the autumn, smart enthusiasts are allowed to avoid even more rapid charging, more durable battery, more high-quality camera and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that on the basis of the rumors, you can already make assumptions and predict four top models that probably capture sales charts this year.
These four smart phone top models will be available to the poets in the fall of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the poets in mid-September.
You hear what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it spreads a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences next to iPhone 6s, it is expected that the new model will be completely different from the previous one for Apple’s 10th birthday.
There are four colors: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the whole front panel of the phone, lost is a home button, and a fingerprint reader is built on the screen.
Apple’s design manager, JonyIve, calls for the new iPhone model to look like a smooth glass.
There was also an iPhone ceramic version.
In addition to eye blind scanners, wireless charging and even more high-quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
It is one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
The Galaxy Note 8 pre-ordering of the brand new model begins on August 23.
There's been a lot of rumors about what new Galaxy Note 8 is going to look like.
Hearingly, more is meant for business users, and S Pen allows even greater functionality.
There should be two cameras on the phone, one with a width and the other with a narrower view of the TV.
Now no one knows what two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung’s first test, which is certainly comparable to iPhone 8.
We look forward to August 23.
Although Nokia has sold three smartphones in Nokia 6 this year, there is still a lack of their flagship ship - Nokia 8, which will be presented already on 16 August.
We look forward to the 5,3 inch edge-to-side screen and high-speed Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and more durable battery.
For Nokia, there is also an aluminium housing and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Similar to Samsung, Nokia has two rear cameras in its new model, which is produced by Zeiss.
If Sony’s secure flagship has been XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future, there will be at least two smartphones with even more innovative features.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is a little more modest than XZ Premium, but with at least the same good or better camera.
Sony’s new model is speculated that its screen is at least six inches.
As a matter of fact, we can see the right head already, because traditionally Sony has released its autumn flag ship at the IFA International Technology Fair, which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September.
According to the phone call leaked transcripts, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post unveiled the transcripts of telephone calls between President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On January 27, Trump called the Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto to stop declaring that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States strangled him for the public condemnation of the Wall, saying, “You cannot say that to the press.”
Trump made his presidential campaign promise to build along the southern border wall of the United States and swore to make Mexico pay for this project.
The transcripts were also announced in his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which reveals a tense exchange of thought.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States of America would take on the refugees to Australia would be “a ridiculous”, “weapon,” and “weapon,” he claimed that the agreement made during the times of the Obama government would leave him an impression as he proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the United States.
Trump stopped talking by telling Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant speech of the day.”
The Supreme Court did not hear a complaint from the Estonian City Lines in which the City of Tartu rejected their tender for the procurement of bus transport from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a decree that rejected the offer of the Estonian MRP Linna Liinid on the bus supply in Tartu, as the tender did not meet the requirements, Anneli Apuhtin, the Head of the City Government Service of Tartu explained.
This is a public bus transport project within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP Linna Liins appealed to the Supreme Court to the judgment of the District Court of Tartu.
The Supreme Court did not take it into consideration.
Although many in social media complain that the noise from the Weekend festival disrupts their nighttime and the whole city is full of drunk partyers, there are many who do not have a bad word about the beach festival.
I’m even very surprised that the store was so polite!
I did not see any confusion or injustice.
I even saw the divorce, says Laine.
“It’s nice to have them come, be and feel the joy of Pärnu, which has been left in the winter,” he adds with joy.
The beach-stamping turret Laine sleep does not bother.
When he heard music playing on the beach while living in the city centre, the music hasn’t reached his house yet.
“But I hope to hear it,” he says with joy.
Agnes, also spoke to the evening newspaper, says that the grand festival is rather good for Pärnu - it will help local merchants get along well.
In addition, he is pleased that so many foreigners have come to visit the capital of the summer.
The noise of the party doesn't bother the woman.
Although I no longer sunk at the beach, it's nice that the beach is alive.
And it’s great that the people are moving and it’s been three times like this,” she says.
The first time, I think it was a little worse.
\"Then maybe there were complaints,\" he thinks.
However, the noise on the beach is common for the Summer Poles.
\"This Weekend is a very good promotion to our little town,\" said Harri.
No noise or noise has hit his life rhythm.
What about it?
We should all stick together.
Think about how it would be better to interact with nations.
A man of loud music won't crush.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live near there.
“Good people can keep together, and there is no trouble,” he said.
Visitors from Pärnu are polite, according to him.
“They are also a little exaggerated with the ones, but the young are young and the father is a god – let go, but be the people, and we can do it,” he says.
Coastal residents have been traveling somewhere by then, either to relatives or acquaintances.
“But in general, the festival will have a positive impact on life – people like such noise,” says Tiina, who walked with children in Pärnu.
His family’s dream of music is not disturbed, although last year it was even further from this year’s.
Last summer, the stage was different, then we heard more.
We live out of the city, and in fact, we feel pretty good about the far side of the river Pärnu,\" he says.
Pearson cuts to another 3000 jobs and reduces dividends to revitalize business
On Friday, the British educational company Pearson said that it would cut further 3,000 jobs and reduce its dividends by 72%, by launching another restructuring program to solve the threat of business.
The lost jobs, which, according to CEO John Fallon, are highly likely to be lost at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, will be added to the 4,000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to reduce the cost of the third cost reduction programme by a further £300 million (€394 million) to try to revitalize the business that has become a hobby due to the rapid digital transition.
A company that agreed to sell its participation in Penguin Random House to its partner company, Bertelsmann, said that their expectations for the year have not changed since 1 percent of the sales revenue was reported in the first half of the year.

Convulsion in Kabul: A suicide attack killed NATO soldier
According to officials, the former bomber attacked military forces in Kabul, Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and wounds of several others.
NATO's statement said that five soldiers and translators were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were killed in the incident in Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have been hit by Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in the Herat Mosque attack.
On Monday, the suicide bomber killed two people near Iraq's embassy in Kabul.
NATO's statement said that Thursday evening explosion took place when a joint battalion with the Afghan army was attacked with a \"human-made explosive\".
According to the statement, everything is damaged in a stable state and is treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to Correspondents, the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), are a source of serious concern for the forces in Qarabagh, NATO Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, around 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, the auto bomb in Kabul mainly killed at least 30 people in the Shiid district.
According to the Taliban, they were behind attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the city, which has led to the most deaths in the country since the US-led forces rejected the Taliban in 2001.
This violence emphasizes a precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while President Donald Trump of the United States is considering increasing the number of military forces and police forces in the United States.
According to Correspondents, suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of trust against the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
The EPA annulled the decision to postpone the order.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annulled the decision to delay the imposition of the Obama Regulation, which obliges states to limit the emission of emissions caused by the state of affairs, one day after 15 states had brought the Agency to court due to that move.
The EPA announced its decision to continue with the 2015 ozone determination operations – late on Wednesday, stating that it demonstrates the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the states.
“We believe that we need to engage in and listen to dialogue with partners from our states,” said Scott Pruitt, Head of EPA.
In June, the Pruitt had announced the intention of the EPA to reject the determination of ozone content in different parts of the country in order to determine where this level should be reduced by one year to a tougher air quality standard in October 2018.
15 In particular, the Democratic States were brought to action together with the Columbia District on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has attempted to withdraw a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, according to Trump, this is part of the broader growth market.
But these efforts have created a response between Democrats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the effects of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that the inhalation of ozone-containing air may reduce the ability to work in the lungs and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases, such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
Germany's pigs and cattle can have a party, as strong rains threaten the European Union's second largest grain of wheat producer, Bloomberg writes.
This year, it can be said that the harvests that lasted for weeks before the harvest may mean that the fruit intended for the baking industry is only suitable for feeding animals.
“The quality of this is far worse than the past and worse than in 2015,” said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat for animal feed, which is double as compared to normal, can be expected in Agravis.
German farmers, as well as their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
The winter was too dry.
Then the cold spring came, which was replaced by a heat wave in June.
In July, the German sajuhooks were hit, which has continued in August.
Many eyes are turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvest.
Until now, only five percent of the wheat has been harvested.
In most areas, the harvest has not yet started, the local harvester Ceravis announced.
“This is quite a difficult day,” said Ceravise’s senior trader Frank Deckert from Rentsburg.
Consistency in everything, or the interior design of the Finns,
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the brass homes, because through large windows, amazing views of the beaches of the Saimaa reach many rooms (life).
Every step, the efforts of our northern neighbours to create both the rough and the perfect (energy-saving) homes at the same time begin to be an eye.
Illustration and adherence are also worthy of Finnish wood usage as construction and finishing material, furniture and beauty.
Vibrating techniques and smart solutions can be found in fair houses by both the builder and the home designer.
There it is evident that black, white and gray shades, when they are supplemented by woodtones and rooms, can be very pleasant.
Good ideas can go on for another week because the fair lasts until 13 August.
The supplies and cots suggest that this kitchen often cooks.
The night against the night was brought down to the Weekend Festival in the Baltics and Martin Garrix gave all that he had to remember as the last performer.
During Garrix’s performance, the crowd was truly turning – singing, dizziness, danced in self-sacrificing.
When Garrix was finished, a common mass was poured out from the beach of Pärnu to the city.
We'll bring you a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer caught in Weekend for three days.
I'm sure you're one of them, find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to go to the most attractive box match in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were at the ESPN office in Los Angeles in separate rooms until Garcia, the unbeatable World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, walked the second end of the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's closure champion.
After the victory after Garcia's unanimous decision, the former four-time world champion Adrian Broner, on Saturday, both fighters will be included in the premiere table.
Garcia stretched her right hand and said, “How are you going, champion?
I wish you good luck.
Lomachenko protects his belts against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19 ESPN.
When a couple of photos were posted, the Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that there would be “perfect measurement” between potential opponents.
“I’m a former featherweight,” Garcia said.
“I moved up to 63.5 kg for Broner, but I’m not that big.
I'm 63.5 kg small.
I want to move downwards of light weight.
And he must move up the light weight [61,2 kg] and then we can fight.
Fans have wanted it.
So let's offer it to them.
Lomachenko agreed.
“The world needs this fight.”
The Klimas raised the question of whether it should be worth watching. This is part of his strategy that he wants to have Lomachenk debuted towards the end of this year in a class of 61.2 kg to make it possible for the next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 nokauts), who also have an interest in fighting Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell match winner after their lightweight round on the Forum on September 23.
“Looking at this fight could be paid, because fans have wanted it in opposition,” Garcia said, later on, he is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
“We are the main characters.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready...
Garcia said she thinks Lomachenko is a “great fighter” and can go to see her Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest when he congratulated Garcia, saying that he thought he saw the champions of three divisions from Riverside out of his mind “very slow; sorry, Mikey...
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the impact strength and then box.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension growing between them.
“It’s a struggle that is waiting for realization.
No other opponent will bring so much attention and sumina.
I’m more than willing to work for it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I’ve been waiting for the best fighters, and that’s exactly what I’ve been waiting for.
It's going to be a good fight.
What aspects of the world are moved to Estonia?
Mullu extended and issued a record of more than 13,000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly traveled to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, if a temporary residence permit was decided to be issued to 6702 foreigners last year, then the number was 4928.
The authorities cannot tell how many migrants will ultimately remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia every year ten years, this figure will begin to reach 2,000 in recent years.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased by a jump during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014, 1087 people were granted a temporary residence permit, 675 years earlier.
According to the Statistical Board, the number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia is increasing most – last year, 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than left.
“The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and due to the complex circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many of the family are already in front of it,” said Christian Rammus, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior.
The number of Ukrainians who had received a temporary residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in the last ten years the maximum number of residence permits has been issued.
If the Ukrainians come here to work heavily, the Russian citizens will come for family migration.
“In view of the historical Russian community here, they are also most likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia,” says the Interior Defence Academy migration researcher, Helina Maasing.
“When you look at where Russian citizens who have been granted a residence permit for Estonia have moved to live, after Harjumaa, you immediately have Eastern Virumaa, he added and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
A temporary residence permit was granted to 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians wishing to extend their residence permit has decreased.
“Hype is due to the fact that a new residence permit has been sought for permanent entry in Estonia instead of extending the residence permit,” said Ramus, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, who said that the interests of Russian citizens have remained stable for years rather than years.
A new residence permit for permanent entry into Estonia can be applied for by foreigners living here for at least three years from the previous year.
Its aim is to promote the survival of adaptable people.
However, long-term residence permits require five years.
Due to the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit has also been reduced.
For example, a residence permit was issued to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Now, the Ukrainians can change their jobs and the Estonian state no longer jumps to see if the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit became popular - applicants for the past year for gray passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A total of 1968 people were allowed to live in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and as many Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
Over the past ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, 200 years ago.
Nigerian universities will be taught here.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among, for example, Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen greatly due to their learning movements.
The rule is also that where the community has come in advance, it is more easy for others to come to,\" Rammus added.
Over the past ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia, and four from Uruguay.
If in the year about 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit, it is about 0.46 percent of the population.
Even if the citizens of the European Union are to be included, the migration remains at about a percentage,\" Maasing said.
According to the statistics agency, 14 822 people traveled to Estonia last year, and 13 792 people came out of here.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of migration.
Most people are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among those who leave.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was reduced to 2,000 people this year.
Estonians travel mainly between Finland and Estonia.

Because neither is it his fault that he doesn’t live in Hollywood and doesn’t go on a red carpet every day, he also wants to wear those most beautiful dresses and wear them!
You can live your own life!
The fashion artist does not recognize the gap between bright events and gray everyday life.
It was this reasoning that the main purpose of the rolling stock plan was to bring the high-rise to land in Estonia, between the forests and the fields, to the people, to whom the fashion often does not reach.
For example, the collection of Mammu was presented on the Moeals of Võrus, Jõhvi and Pärnu, where the Royal Defilee with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, it is often taken in, pickled with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - the braavos are calling up, they want to thank you hand-in-hand.
Much of the audience had to be renewed, but now they are the fans of Mamma Couture.
If you exceed people’s expectations, they will be impressed!
And I like the feeling that I'm in my way of summer.
We had a 50-metre red carpet, a whole street full of dresses, it seemed like they didn't end it!
Maria also does not admit that the creation must be presented to the supersale supermodel, she gladly brings the ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own customers to the stage - they have always been happy.
This is such a great experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my show myself, I've always been behind the stage to give the last piece as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve wouldn't allow me to watch the hall peacefully.
Maria is the kind of fashionator who does not just want to perform the role of the representative but is in the hands of everything.
I have a sewing machine in the studio, most of the collections I perform myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, you discover.
I’m never far from my creation and I’m not afraid of work.
It is not limited to the design, it is also about stylistics, logistics, organisation, organization - everything needs to accommodate the day of one temperament woman.
These hours of work are still huge for fanatics.
I can’t tell you when my work day ends, it’s just a day full of joy for me!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an endless sense of happiness: I'm doing something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and, in turn, compliments.
Many times it has been said that my dresses have magic - they make you feel like a princess.
The great bully sacires that made Maria's talent famous overnight, have remained the signature of Mamma Couture until today.
Martin Müürsepp U18 boys: The gun of the Estonian subgroup tournament was turned against us now.
I'm sorry, the fairy tale is over.
The first thing I saw was that we couldn't get to our desk.
And when there’s so much difference on the table, there’s nothing to do,’ said Estonian U18 basketball boys 61:75, who played our only NBA basketball player, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach Martin Mürssepp.
The opponents took 28 balls from the attack table and received so much more attacks.
We were also not ready for their aggressive defense or attack, it was created.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn’t build a defense.
But in defense, they got to hold hands everywhere, we couldn't combine.
It hit the team's legs off.
The response home work was better done.
According to the myth, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to take down the attack.
On the last quarter - we had a zero error, but the opponents had already received several quick baskets.
Athleticity and tight pursuit, which was a sub-group tournament on our weapon, now turned to us all.
Today we had no force against their aggression.
The Wallsmith remained in peace with his guardian Kalevi, Matthias Tass.
In general, the tournament will be able to say good words about the whole team, so far it was a single hit.
It's a shame that the bolts with such aggressive opponents have been met before.
Tass has been confident all the time and played her out today, but it seemed that she was tired - she had been wearing quite a lot of load.
But he made some pretty moves I’ve seen before in training, adding a tutor.
Horrible numbers: in the basket of these baskets, the EM tournament threw in three quarters less than 10 points...
In the U18 age class, not only did the EM B-division basketball tournament take place in Tallinn, the ladies started over in Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland was still in the field of anti-recording.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter there was 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took the foot off the gas pedal, and that period remained at Week 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia threw 4, in the third 1 point...
In the beginning, the Estonians hit two of the first four shots in two minutes, and from the game along 25 pieces, one in three, and then 21 in a row.
Maybe within almost half an hour, 47 shots were hit.
In addition, 2 out of 4 free shots came.
There was a reasonable number of sources in that time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland was 33 and Estonia had 13% (68/9).
Estonia has begun with two losses, and on the opening day it was necessary to recognize Portugal’s 83:56 better.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to supplement stocks
Today, NATO’s 1st permanent mine control group arrived for a weekend at a scheduled port visit to Tallinn to complete the ship’s stocks and prepare for the next exercises.
During the visit, ships prepare to return to the sea and give team members the opportunity to leave for a few days.
After a visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters in order to carry out a number of exercises and be ready for future operations to search for historical explosives.
\"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and their co-operation in local waters is well reflected in our integration with allied forces,\" said Chief Operation and Planning Department Chief of the Marine Navy, Chief of Operation and Planning Division, Mr. Arti Reinmaa.
From 29 June, the Latvian Marine Lieutenant General Gvido Laudups, who took over the tasks of the group commander in Riga from the Estonian naval officer, took over from the Estonian naval officer, John-Elia from Seljamaa.
The group's flagship is designated as a support vessel for the Latvian Navy in the LVNS Virsait, which also operates the group's control.
During this semester, Sakala is also part of the international unit.
One of the four groups of ships under NATO's Marine Command is NATO's 1st permanent mine control group, a unit of emergency unit belonging to the primary high-speed reactors, which can be sent to different parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirida Monastery will once again become a place to be held at the Birgitta Festival, which was invited to life 13 years ago by the Maestro Eri Klas.
According to Risto Joosti, the artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonia Festival (36) will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The opera world's classics include \"Travata – and Tosca –, ballet responses from the fascinating \"Boleros\" fun \"Karlssonini\" and also lacks a plan of own production, which is then directed by the same international creative team of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorium, \"Times\" of Joseph Haydn, who brought the second masterpiece of Haydn on Pirital in 2015.
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre performances.
This is bigger than any music theater in its normal form.
It’s a festival that takes power and never lets go again.
For the experience that the listener receives in this transcendent and mysterious environment makes human souls brighter and touches human senses in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't the maestro's different klas shoes look a little big?
Of course, since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it has been a lot of help.
He directed me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of the division career.
Perhaps because of this, it’s easier for me to continue his work.
The Eri Klas has injected the Birgitta Festival team so much goodness and, of course, it will all pass on to me as well.
It was great to join a team who knew exactly how things were going.
The great heart of the Eri Klas also gave me strength to move forward in the Tallinn Philharmonia with the Birgitta Festival.
And here I am and I can do it!
What can be enjoyed by the audience at the festival this year, what are you offering?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania, and as a surprise, the first ballet to be presented will be written for the Ashtrid Lindgren story.
The \"Karlsson Flys \"
And one of the notorious nuances about this ballet is that the author of this ballet is the composer of the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed the desire to write it.
He has probably lived in Karlsson's character since he was a child.
Risto, how can you do all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I am lucky to have a pile.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions are not as much dependent on other people as I am, perhaps, on every new day.
And keeping such a conscious tone, keeping positive and actually smiling to yourself in the morning mirror, greatly increased my happiness rate.
Especially this week, if you have the most important samples, I’ve been doing this especially a little bit and it works.
Smile activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a word ring.
I think people still don’t know anything about their body that the universe offers to them, but, of course, everyone discovers it gradually.
Right now, it's an important moment.
Do you have a ritual before the conductor's party arrives?
Still, clothes need to be changed to be more comfortable.
It's a small moment for yourself.
But generally, I don't have the opportunity to rest or make a little nap before a big show.
In fact, I even like to actively communicate with people, even before you enter the driver's desk.
But come to the Birgitta Festival, here’s what to discover not a very big opera and ballet friend!
Watch the fun video with Risto Joost!
New results of tests for the assessment of the age of Swedish asylum seekers
In Sweden, a test was conducted to assess their age with a new approach medically. The latest results of the test show that more than 80 percent of the tested subjects were rated older than 18, but not all of them believed in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Judicial Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began the tests in the beginning of this year.
The tests were set up for a more accurate assessment of the age of asyl after the Swedish Immigration Service (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to properly determine the age of several alleged minor refugees.
At present, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to test, and the Institute of Court Medicine has issued a total of 2481 tests from mid-March 2017 until 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) was estimated to be 18 years old or older, and in 25 cases, the Institute of Court Medicine assessed that the testable “may be 18 years old or older”
In 432 cases, it came to the conclusion that a person is “presumably younger than 18-20”
The tests are used only if the age of a person is below the question mark.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Judiciary Medicine, the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
“We don’t see much difference compared to the statistics of the previous months, the numbers are quite consistent,” he told the newspaper The Local.
The fact that most cases were considered older than 18, does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued 581 test results in May and said that in 442 cases “there are indications that the study person is 18 years old or older”
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet studied the results of their 581 tests, it turned out that 243 cases had been directly claimed that this year’s 18th year.
This method of medical age assessment, in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRT of knee joints are performed, after which they will be tested by dentists and radiologists, have been criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is the Karolinska Institute’s endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose tasks include evaluating human biological maturity to determine whether they passed puberty sooner or later.
“I have had a reason to think about it, and I do not think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t be sure, we shouldn’t make the face so we can,” he told the newspaper Metro.
But Johan Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests from the Institute of Court Medicine: “In general, it can be said that the risk of a child becoming an adult is low.
The highest risk, or about 10%, is when a person is a little less than 18-20

A 20-year-old left-winger Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut on London's MM, getting a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was the youngest female carer, and a cheerful woman confirmed that she was hoping to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and got a good experience.
With the first attempt (64.80) I immediately took my average result, the second (62.80) I risked too much and the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear,\" Orel said after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm so glad I found it.
Anna Orel's MMI debut ended well in 18th place.
The rainfall of Orel did not interfere, because he trains the winter through the TUT Stadium.
“I’m hardened,” he said with a little sister.
London Olympic Stadium had almost a whole house of people, did Orel perceive people around himself or could he turn off?
I realized, but in a positive way.
Everybody says it gives you more - that's right!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he was still in peace with MM's debut, and he was looking forward to a lot of good competitions: \"I came here with the 32nd of the season this year, or the last result, I finished my 18th.
This is a very good result.
I'm 20 years old and MM, that's the only thing that counts.
I'm going to take a good experience, and some days I'm going to fight for the Medals.
Governor West Virginia announced a party shift
President Jim Justice, the Democratic Governor of West Virginia, announced on Thursday evening when he met President Trump that he would change the parties.
“Whether it or not, the Democrats walked away from me,” said Governor Justice.
“Today I say to you, having prayed greatly and thought about it... today, I say to you, the West Virginias, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor.”
At the time of the gathering, the joys came to light.
“I’m going to be a Republican tomorrow,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I’d tell you that it’s time to play another game.”
Trump had previously promised a great deal of communication at the Western Virginia gathering.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia, and Justice did not support the candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and the coal company is his father.
His value is about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the National Committee of the Republicans (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that \"the exchange of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party, which would prevent the country from re-improvement rather than working for it\".
“All 15 governors and control the lowest number of states in history – Governor Justice’s announcement is simply the most recent rejection of the party, which is at the end of the day and is not able to find a positive and connecting message,” said CSC’s premiere Ronna McDaniel, a statement to CBS News.
There is no surprise that where there are many people, there are also many injured.
Urmet, who was in a medical tent in Weekend, said to the evening newspaper that they had to share a lot of patches.
Wilds and marries are the main, outstretched and light falls.
Also headaches, back and foot pains.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with false shoes and so come problems.
Doctors have also had to help a couple of more injured visitors - there have been some panic attacks and also one leg fracture.
We have also made seams when a person has broken his hand or finger.
Smaller seams we're gonna do here, we're gonna send the bigger ones to the hospital.

Coe thanked the Russians for their sincere apology for the doping scandal.
Sebastian Coe, a lightweight international noseman, praised Russia’s four-day sincere apology for the doping scandal, but repeated that it is not time to allow the country to return to sport.
Russian lightweight noseman Dmitry Shylahtin said at the IAAF Congress on the premiere of the World Championships in the light force, that the competition ban imposed on his country was correct and has a definite aim of fighting the doping.
He apologized to “all the light-power athletes from whom the gold- and silver medals have been clicked off in the competitions.”
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of putting in force the ban on competition imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-backed doping in Russia.
“I think it was a very honest answer today, with a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The entire Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Alliance itself acknowledged that they had had quite difficult times and that they would do everything possible to restructure the Alliance.”
Coe also said he was pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its restoration.
“I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place, but Congress supports the group’s proposal that it is not time to withdraw Russia now,” Coe said.
“We should do everything possible in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always been based on the principle that we want to separate pure athletes from the corrupt system,\" he added.
Nineteen Russian light-power teams that meet the strict criteria of the IAAF will compete in the world championships starting in London as neutral athletes.
On Monday, the head of the IAAF Working Group, Rune Andersen, said that Russia did not yet meet a number of criteria for improvement.
After a presentation by the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that the Doping Control was still insufficient and the trainers who had been banned still operate freely.
The electric car revolution significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Few that the electric car revolution significantly changes everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say that they win from one place and lose from the other, smaller mining companies will not help.
Today Glencore is serving coal and oil, but in the future, electric cars will grow in cave, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel demand.
This year, in terms of the distribution of electric cars, contributions have been raised by the United Kingdom, France and Norway governments, which allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades.
Volvo has already announced that they plan to quit the combustion engine and Tesla will bring cheaper Model 3 electric cars to the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that electric cars are sold for more than two decades than oil-based fuels.
“For some of the metals, this changes everything,” said the Capital Economics raw materials analyst Simona Gambranini Bloomberg.
We have already seen a great impact on metals such as a cave and lithium, whose demand has increased for years.
There are about three times more copper in electric cars than in a conventional car, Glencore said.
More copper is needed in charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paris estimates that it will increase copper demand by about five per cent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore becomes a growing electric car trend revenue from the copper price rise and from the fact that it is the world’s largest cobalt producer, forecasted by Jefferson Group.
According to this brokering company, the winners of other electric cars are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, 70 percent of London’s metal stock exchange has risen from the cave.
The price increase in the month was 37 percent.
The copper has also increased by 14% this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore’s stock rose by 20 percent in London, with a price increase exceeding Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo America.
On the side of the losers, companies dealing with the lead are like Recyclex and Campine, who need to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of the lead is the batteries that supply petrol and diesel-powered cars with a power supply.
Electric cars use lithium ion batteries.
“This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found for another purpose that could overcome the drop in demand,” said Michael Widmer, the metal market analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The impact of this trend on the price movement is not yet noticeable.
Lead has risen 17% this year, with the best metal in London among the main industrial metals.
Investors see problems for metal still far away from the future.
“I’m not sure that lead is so bad because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive,” said Herwig Schmidt, the sales manager of the metal broker Triland Metals.
When the lead falls, it happens slowly.
It may happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, tougher emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which are dependent on advanced lead-based batteries when starting frequent engines, will be assessed by an international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals like aluminum replace steel, as a lighter car can drive further with less electricity.
This explains the additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium.
This represents 2.7 percent of the total output of aluminum in the world.
This trend is likely to worsen, said Widmer.
Aluminum has risen 13 percent this year, as the growing demand by car manufacturers has led to market deficits.
Steel manufacturers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding collaborates with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of wonderful autocycles.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe also strive to develop a lighter alloy steel to stand against aluminum.
“The ultimate steel should be the answer to this development,” said the Exane BNP Paris analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There are some successes in Europe.
The end of the Oil Age can also bring suffering to the platinum.
At the end of the month, about half of this precious metal diesel-powered car catalysts were used, the metal-refiner Johnson Matthey said.
“Many raw materials with high demand today, such as oil and platinum, may not be in high demand in the future,” Natixises’ raw materials analyst Bernard Dahdah said.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
Plate manufacturers believe that there is a continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, head of Uncore, said that in 2025 more hybrid cars are still being sold.
The great hope of platinum manufacturers over the 10-year period is the hydrogen-based cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos, which depend on platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
However, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
“Dise seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars,” said Exane BNP from Paris.
In July, German car manufacturers became part of the big blow, as Stuttgart’s court banned the use of the diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche’s hometown.
How football rules affect the transition of Neymar to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing uncontrolled use of European football clubs do not prevent the transition from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona Club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from UEFA, a management body that dominates the European game and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, Paris Saint-Germain is still waiting for him.
UEFA’s fair game financial rules (FFP) in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove that Neymar’s transition was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million (262 million) solely to buy a Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar's salary starts to reach tens of millions a year.
Here are some financial aspects of the transfer to the French club of Neymar.
The PSG will undoubtedly be able to recruit Neymar and add such money to its starring rivalry, given that the team is funded by the family of Qatarn energy offenders.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of time recruiting players, but they need to balance it with legal income sources that allow them to come out with their football team.
The FFP was set up by Michel Platini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fell into major debt in search of success, would actually engage in fraud and risk destruction if banks or owners had to give up their support.
Since 2011, FFP has focused on tracking these losses instead of the debts of clubs.
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich first in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a potential club and then make large expenses to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
For the current three-year assessment period, which lasts until 2018, clubs may bear losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platin was repudiated from the Presidential Office in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceffer, is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
“FFP is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules,” said the Associated Press for Andrea Traverso, a UEFA FFP supervisor.
Although PSG paid for the Neymar acquisition clause as a single full payment, it is possible to allocate this amount for accounting purposes to parts throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar entered into a five-year contract, which allows the transitional fee to be shown as a sum of EUR 44.4 million in the next five years.
For the first wave of FFP sanctions, in 2014, PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, received the most severe punishments on Manchester City.
A fine of 60 million euros ( currently 82 million dollars) was imposed on PSG, which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and the club was required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to exploit regulatory financial institutions by raising their incomes through companies related to the owners of the club.
Katari’s company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of Qatar Tourism Authority PSG’s support was exhausted.
It has been said that a certain part of the service of Neymar PSG can come from Qatar through the payments of the 2022 World Championships Committee.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymarist could become an ambassador of World Championships and claim that UEFA regulatory authorities could easily expose such a maneuver.
The penalties imposed on PSG earlier mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the rules.
The people who were familiar with the situation said Thursday that UEFA has not discussed the transition with PSG in a proactive manner.
They talked to The Associated Press on the condition that their anonymity is ensured, as they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
Recent reports show that PSG earned more than EUR 10 million of profits over the 2015-2016 period at turnover of approximately EUR 542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar will have a good impact on sponsorship transactions, trade and shirt sales.
The club is expected to increase by at least 30 per cent of turnover in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
Spain too, being clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar’s transition, claiming that PSG would violate FFP.
“This is a clear – financial doping – case with the club and the state,” La Liga’s President Javier Tebas said to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG belongs mainly to Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsenal, Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to American sports magnade, shares La Liga’s attitude to finance the club.
“This is the consequence of property rights and has changed the entire football landscape in the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of the fair game, as the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player in the country.
Norwegian low cost airlines Norwegian is a nice tradition to put pictures of aircraft on display in their own field of boundaries and have been inspired by others, says Trip.ee
Along with the expansion of Norwegian operations geography, the circle of people who have earned a place on the plane has also expanded.
Among selected individuals, for example, Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (picture) and Miguel de Cervantes.
In the near future, however, a plane will be decorated with the portrait of the legendary Queen singer Freddie Mercury.
Today, 50 years ago: the storm of the hurricane dimension in Estonia, which ripped the roofs and windows from the houses.
A century-old hurricane, called the storm, which hit the West, Harjumaa and Raplamaa in particular on 6 and 7 August.
During these days, the wind speed was over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one archeic tree to another in the garden and covered them with his hands.
It was all dark and raspberry, like the end of the world.
Back in the world, the roofs were already flying from the houses, reminding the old lady Linda Kurova Haapsalu in an interview with Estonian Nature.
Linda's husband saw her house falling apart.
But what do you do with your wooden hands, where do you get this storm?
The sea came under the window, from windows sprayed in the water,\" said Mrs. Linda, who lived on the street of Haapsalus Kalda.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the train station had flown 20-30 meters away, Linda saw most of the Haapsalus until the next morning.
According to locals, the trees behind Paralepa were in the ground, some completely down, some half down.
Everyone looked very depressed, the storm went through the beautiful old trees as a cell and a pragina like a war.
West Virumaa could not suffer particularly hard in August 1967 compared to West Estonia, but the damage was great there, in 2007 Virumaa's Official Journal.
Haapsalu Loss Park and Padise Park wiped the ground, but also the parks of our deck were strongly affected.
In Tallinn, the wind speed was measured up to 35 meters per second, about 130 kilometers per hour.
On the evening of the 6th of August in Tallinn, a little girl shouted, “Mom, Mom!
The chickens are in the air, and they can no longer get down,\" wrote Virumaa's Official Journal.
The Põll Manor building in Viljandi County was destroyed during the storm so that it was decided to be demolished later.
The August Tower did not withstand the constructions of Türi ski jumptop, which was later restored.
The Red Star was written on 12 August 1967 in order to clean the cities and settlements out of the fallen trees and their branches slowly, and the inhabitants could take part in the cleaning work.
In the storm, fruit crops were also affected, and the newspaper reported that \"partial organizations must be inspired and guided both by repairs and by the harvest of fruits.\"
Orcans can be discussed if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of clean wind in Estonia will remain on 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul was measured at a speed of 48 m/s.
In the island of Vaindloo, the meter was broken, so the strong wind speed measured there could not be accurately recorded.
Secret of clean bathing beaches: night cleaning and poor beach weather
Coldest summer worlds also mean smaller cleaning in the bathing beaches of Tallinn.
“If there is no air, then people are on the beach, and if there are no people, there are no people, the beach cleaner will say.
In the shores of Strom, North Tallinn, the kayaks are screaming.
They are offered a melodic competition on low rotations of a booming tractor that stretches the stripes down to the plateau.
In fact, the last seven centimetres deep through the sand, picking out the seaflake and the abandoned rice of humans: bottle caps, cigarettes and more.
People come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If there is a beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if not, there are no people,\" says Aleksandr Usov, head of the construction work of the Haaberst.
At 6:30 a.m. and on the beach, there is a bitter cleaning work, because at 8 p.m., the site needs to be in order for people.
Usov is already at four o'clock.
In addition to the Strom, he will keep an eye on the shores of Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Pikakar of Paljasaari.
Waste amounts have decreased.
Years ago it was much more.
People can now evaluate what is done for them, says Usov, who has been on the beach for 15 years.
Before something new was put up, it was broken the next day.
Now they're keeping what's on the beach.
Clean beach price
One of the biggest works on the shores of Estonia is the cleaning of sea waste or adru.
For example, at the beach of Pirita, 400 000 tonnes must be transported after the beach season.
“This is an incredible amount,” Usov notes.
The second major category is the household waste, that is, everything that people leave behind.
On the beach strip of the semi-kilometre Stromium, there are eight large landfill containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
There's so much rubbish going on.
However, the colder summer worlds have meant that the garbage is a fifth less than otherwise.
The third species constitute abandoned things.
Most of them are children's lives.
This time, Usov's sand has spied out a dozen models of cars.
They will be waiting for the owners on the beach.
“It usually comes out more, but it’s a normal harvest – Usov already knows that he will soon find them again in the sand.
The kids come to the beach and take toys to sink them back into the sand.
The waste is poured out
A representative of Haaberst’s administrative services, Erika Scheller, admits that the tractor’s screening work interferes with locals.
The noise, which lasts from night to early morning, interferes with the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
This work is impossible in the day.
In one month, the beach must be taped twice.
“If we don’t do this, the district will punish us,” Scheller notes.
However, the aim is similar to Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu to get the Stromic beach under the international seal quality mark.
“As compared to Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are maintained,” Scheller said.
We have more ad and more stones and more difficult to chew sand.
There are less rubbish on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Hearing that the beach is talking about rubbish, Martin, who lives near the Stromian beach, is forced to enter the chat circle of journalists and cleaning workers, highlighting the current bottlenecks of the beach.
There's a rough picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle harvesters who have pulled garbage bags off the ground,\" Martin says.
While it is difficult to assume that people can change their habits, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about landfills and, for example, put covers on them to prevent at least birds going on the news.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of the Stromian beach.
It is seen that the city will take care of it.
With children’s fields, illuminated and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
It was once so that only one road could drive,\" Martin said.
Treasure found in Stromom: coins, only coins
In the morning, the sword period has come to be used by the 40-year-old Dimitri, who, as a treasurer, is combing a beachside with a metal detector.
He does not believe that there will be anything precious in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough.
“I’ve been doing this for a year and haven’t found anything valuable so far,” Dmitry reports.
As a hobby hunter, Dmitry's treasure is a few euro coins, bottle caps, and also dangerous pounds, which later throws the trash box.
There are usually coins.
“The gold, rings, and other such things are usually not – the treasure is named.
Bank of England maintains interest rates at 0.25%
The announcement from the Bank of England is that interest rates will remain at the former level, as the inefficient economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have softened speculation in relation to the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain low, as household incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers voted in favour of keeping the rates of 6:2 at 0.25%, and fewer members call for an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank reduced its growth forecast to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household incomes would remain, as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the bank also indicated that the increase in rates was necessary to control inflation due to Brexit over the next few years and that a higher than expected increase in loan costs could be necessary in financial markets.
The members also voted a year ago for the partial withdrawal of the package of mammoths that would be placed on the market as a result of Brexit.
In February, the Bank will close a fixed-term financing scheme that will provide banks with cheap financing, although it said that now, under this scheme, it is expected to offer a £15 billion higher bid, which is £ 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision to be decided on, the Bank says: “In the medium-term forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) will remain effective in the near future, as the difficult situation of real incomes in households will continue to have an impact on consumption.
The definitions were repeated that \"some effort of the financing policy is needed to mitigate inflation, and to a somewhat higher extent than expected in the markets.
The stock market is currently predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and the second rise in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any jumps are gradual and limited.
The bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this year and for the next year are compared to May’s forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The 2018 1.8% growth forecast remained.
After that news, the pound rate fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent growth indicators that have suppressed the growing hopes of rising GDP in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it begins to build a little momentum.
The Bank’s latest inflation report gave a few reasons to delight households suffering from rising inflation and poor wage rise, saying that the situation will get a little worse before the recovery.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent income shocks in the next few years, but a noticeable wage recovery is expected to be expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
As a result of a weak pound, the economy is also stimulated by growing demand for British production, which partly compensates consumers for lower costs.
The decision will come a year after the rates were taken at 0.25% last August after the shocking EU referendum, causing a sudden weakening of the pound.
According to the Bank, it is likely that it will take four years to fully address prices and the economy.
Before the last decision of the bank, the growing demand for raising the rate of demand was felt, as inflation had increased the pressure on households in hardship; in July, three policymakers called for an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected and in the next few months it was expected to rise again.
The bank said that excessive growth compared to a 2-percent target was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlape, head of Coreco mortgage brokers, said: “In view of the recent fall in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to become more and more competitive as lenders want to work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock market seems particularly favourable for those whose transactions are going to be completed, as refinancing, often with a service fee and a low rate, has become more and more popular.
The NHS is writing to 10,000 people about conflicting HIV medications
From September, patients have access to \"transformative\" HIV for preventive treatment after the battle with the Supreme Court over whether NHS should finance the drug.
NHS England reported that, during the initial three-year clinical trial, national health care is now estimated to make pre-exploitant prophylaxis (PREP) available to 10,000 people – a tablet that is administered before the interval and which has shown a reduction in the risk of infection by approximately 86% in people at high risk.
The NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the Board of Appeal supported the Supreme Court’s decision of the previous year that NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite the statement by the Authority that the drug should be financed by local authorities.
NHS England CEO Simon Stevens welcomed this Thursday as a “new major intervention” while the National Aid Fund (NAT) described it as a “vertical moment”
Sex clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October, more clinics will be added before the program is launched in England by April 2018.
Pre-exploitation prophylaxis (PREP) is a course of HIV medicines that are taken before the interval to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before an interval means that there are enough medications in the human body that prevent HIV from being infected.
Such medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before intercourse.
Candidates suitable for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and who are not treated.
Clinics identify suitable people who agree to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-infected partner cannot receive antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor can register their participation in the program at the local sexual health clinic.
The program pays £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to get medications this week after the international procurement procedure.
The objective of the clinical trial is to assess the actual potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of who the drug is intended and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture.
Stevens said: “This new extensive intervention should complement and enhance the fight against widespread and ever more successful HIV transmission.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of struggle with one of humanity’s greatest health problems.
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT, said: “This is a turning moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted correctly to those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic of England.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool, which is individually managed and independent of negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We welcome this announcement warmly.
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “It is important now to ensure that the clinical trial is quickly postponed across the country and that no HIV risk group member is left behind.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been obtained, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.
Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Public Health, said: “The beginning of a clinical trial in PrEP is very welcome and very late after months of delay and the drag of the government’s feet.
Evidence shows how much changes this drug can bring to the end of HIV prevention work and its life-changing infection.
This clinical trial will take us a step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial be taken over the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and take us a step closer to stopping HIV transmission in society.
The price of electricity increased by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania it fell.
In July, the exchange price difference between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to €1.94 compared to €7.71 in June this year, Elering said.
The main reason for price differences is the failure of the Lithuanian-Sweden Community.
In Estonia, the average exchange price of electricity was EUR 34.33 per megawatt-hour last month, and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36,27 per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the Norwegian Pool system price was EUR 26.37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and 7 percent, respectively.
The electricity between Estonia and Finland moved 75% of the last month's hours in Estonia and 16% of the hours in Estonia.
The remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not have the next day’s transactions.
Between Estonia and Latvia, the electricity moved from Estonia to Latvia by 99 per cent and 73 per cent of the hours had total transmission capacity.
According to the transactions on the last trading day of July, Nasdaq OMX in August may become an electricity exchange price of approximately 34 euros per megawatt-hour in August and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of CO2 affecting the electricity production price increased last month, and the transactions took place at a price of EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
Living a higher life - half floor and smart design icons have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate reformer, exchanged his big Knightsbridge home in 2014 against Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne has not packed his bags and sold the apartment on sale is a tribute to the new design.
“Before I lived with my former partner on a much larger surface in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I bought something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this apartment at Earls Court, and it had similar high ceilings.
I fell in love with this and did the same day an offer.
Since the first visit, this 93-metre apartment has undergone a complete innovation cycle.
At first, it was a single bedroom and a complex apartment - to reach the bedroom, it was necessary to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add the storage room and half floors to use high ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, large windows, a lot of light.
These were my demands,\" he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi Notting Hill from the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed to use the 3.8 m height ceilings and create a home that would not just be a developmental object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a half floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
“Metal construction is quite complicated,” he explains.
“We had to reorganize the premises so that they would be located on each other without having to shrink.
It wasn’t just the construction of a platform, we used a steel structure so that the height of both the upper and lower spaces would be right.
This setting allowed Erfan to create two rooms with a full height in the room with plenty of dramatic elements.
From the half floor, old-fashioned copper light opens from the window of Retrovius to the glamour living space below the view.
The golden furniture with mirror surface, silver details, and retro-hot Serge Mouille lighting emphasizes the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, space, and light tolerance.
Both ends of the short corridor are accompanied by mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with a mirror leaves a window opening in another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage space for all Joanne dining bags and glassware.
In the living room, charm adds the possibility of closing the kitchen part if it is not used, creating imagination from a more glamour space.
The kitchens are nothing new.
However, this kitchen has a unique fact that it is a garage type with an uplifting door.
“There was a bit of a lack of design,” explains Erfan, a steel-strengthened MDF door.
“It’s counterbalance, so it slides very easily when it’s pushed up.”
Thanks to the smart use of the room and storage room, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
“In the end, the floor is what you sell – or what gives value to the property,” Erfan says.
“The real estate broker enters the outdated form of the room and makes calculations based on the area of the floor.
Here they have been able to increase the floor, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
“Materials are what you touch and thus help to create an emotional connection with your home,” Erfan says.
“You don’t fall in love with the electric cable on the wall.
It’s important, but it doesn’t make your heart sound.
This shows that good design and enhanced area will help make a pretty ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they can create a desire not to leave, as has happened to Joanne.
Vice President Dane Jensen is a Chicago high-end bounty hunter who competes with his colleague for professional promotion.
There is nothing but the amount of money you earn, with all the ethics you forget about.
His wife and three children see him only early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I hit myself thinking that it’s a “card house – a version of the business world – even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler’s speech manager.
What the film is going on, the less the frame-house element remains, and the moralization of filmmakers is starting to appear more and more.
For a life-changing experience, the son’s illness becomes cancer to the main character.
Now we have to make a choice between working and family life.
The son who dreams of the Architectural Board makes his father think about the great buildings of Chicago, such as faith, goodness, love... without even touching the twin tower disaster.
After the third scene, where the son opens his eyes, it becomes a feeling that the filmmakers have come from the goal of getting the audience to cry, because even the most rigorously hearted viewer will not be able to hold back tears in the sight of the beloved cancer boy’s suffering.
When his son falls into a coma and his situation seems hopeless, his father will finally understand his work on morality and will do good work for the old man who is looking for a good work.
Now, I'm bet on myself - if the movie has a happy one, then I'm going to premiere my vision after the movie's coffee, but if I'm wrong, the screenwriter can praise me for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a doubt that I'm going to stay out of coffee - when the husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man rushes down to the hallway room.
But the son is wonderfully healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I feel good too - I can predict the end of the American drama quite well!
To be honest, the film is well designed, all the necessary elements exist.
You can cry, you can laugh, actors are good and moral beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I think this movie is going to bring in well.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the use of the President's media.
Others have attempted and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can handle it.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the new White House Chief of Staff intends to limit the flow of information that President Trump has reached, including news, in the hope that he will keep the boss flatter in water.
Here's a interrupted reporter from Josh Dawsey:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with high officials on his first working day, he raised a key problem in President Donald Trump’s White House, which he planned to solve bad information in the hands of the President.
Kelly told the officials that the information should go through him, whether on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information.
Kelly's diagnosis seems logical, but others have tried it, and they have failed to track Trump's media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back to decades, and now that he's in the White House, his television viewing habits have not gone anywhere.
“When the candidate Trump was angry about unfair media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also honest in the relevant publications,” said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that “the former campaign worker of the six states that Trump’s Twitter habits are the key to managing Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption is stablely included in the song of praise.”
All right.
But the idea that the habits of using Trump Twitter have ever been “controlled” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaigners know something that the rest of us don’t know that Trump’s phrases would have been even more sophisticated without their interventions.
We probably never know about the phrases Trump did not post.
When his assistants were able to save him a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from constantly creating noemics.
Some of the problems are that people in the White House, which consists of competing clicks, try to promote exclusively their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be reliable.
In May, Politico, which reflects the whole course of the story, wrote to the president about the tendency of counsellors to feed information of strategically questionable value.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
“Pragues and former Trump subjects say Trump can react to negative press, especially to adverse information leaks, explosively, by capturing their source of source detection.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone gave the President a printed copy of the article on the website GotNews.com, which included Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Chief of Staff of Staff, Katie Walshi, of being the source of the White House’s “multiple” information.
It doesn’t matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter due to harassment, or that he didn’t offer any specific evidence, or that he has filed false accusations in the past and has taken them back.
Trump read the article and began to inherit from Walsh
Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Head of the White House Office Rob Porter-on attempted to establish a system for the management and documentation of documents reaching Trump.
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader in Priebus, but Trump is still an impulse and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from a foreign capital do not get permission to perform bitter.
There are a lot of foreigners in the city centre.
Those with whom the evening newspaper was discussed admitted to play in the old town without the permission of the city government.
First, we found three street musicians near Viru Gates who had taken as many dogs with them.
It was clear that musicians with rascals and scented clothes were backpackers for whom one shower would wear a berry.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the company played a fun story with a rhythm, while one man played with three balls and called the passers closer to him.
The third man had sat next to them on one backpack and smoked the heart peace himself ready to screw.
These three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing people.
Bob, who played the chonglery with Noemi and balls, said they were playing on the streets for both fun and money.
The aim of the company’s performance was to collect ticket money on the same day’s trip to Finland.
Asked if they asked the city for permission to play in the old town, Noemi and Bob’s head were shaking.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple, and most of the time, we will be given permission for a month or something like that.
It doesn’t make sense to pay, Bob explained.
When about 20 minutes later we got back to Viru Gates, we saw two women at the musicians and drove them away.
The Society moved to the crossroads of the Viru Center with backpacks and dogs.
There were also three Polish young men on Viru Street, one of whom played a violin, the other playing a piano, and the third had brought an electronic piano.
“We are here to provide entertainment to people to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living,” said Trio, a pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that the city government must have permission to perform.
“Of course we don’t have it,” he said in a joke.
But we hope that when people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we'll go elsewhere, but we'll have to try,\" he added.
In July, Eesti Pank purchased bonds for EUR 149 million in the framework of the euro area central banks’ public reserve purchase programme, the central bank’s bond portfolio grew to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank will not publish more detailed information about purchases.
The President of Eesti Pank Hardo Hansson has previously explained that the Eurosystem central banks’ asset purchase plan covers three different purchase programmes: financial sector covered bonds (covered bonds), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank purchases bonds from the market to encourage investors who sell bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Under the influence of the acquisitions, the return on low-risk assets will fall, and this will motivate investors to take higher risks.
In general, as part of a public bond purchase programme, each central bank purchases its own government bonds, and other national bonds are not purchased.
Since the Estonian State has not issued bonds, the Bank of Estonia will make the so-called replacement purchases within the amount allocated to them.
Central banks also make replacement purchases in those countries where the provision of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
Eesti Pank, with the approval of Hansson, generally buys bonds of European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank will purchase bonds in the framework of the asset purchase programme as of March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering’s bonds were also purchased, but from June 2016 Eesti Pank no longer buys Elering’s bonds.
On behalf of the euro area central banks, from June, both Elering and Eesti Energia bonds are purchased by the Bank of Finland.
The travelers ignore the crate and return to the “Million District”
Some of the richest domestic owners of West Midlands have again fallen into a fierce confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the board of mined crates to win back the field from their villa.
The travelers have parked their 20 trailers in the field as a wealth-millionaire district, baptized near Solihull Street.
They have returned with the army of horses, children, and trucks after they were beaten out of the country, without allowing themselves to be mixed with a crate that was dug up by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak place in the protection limits, pinching their vehicles through the unhindered part of the left side of the road.
The Maruvil residents have been scattered by the Solihull Council, saying that the Council is “ineffective in dealing with the problem”
One anonymous resident said: “They moved there on Monday night after their exit from Bentley Heathis, where they threw away the passers with stones.
The council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back again.
They came to you last night, probably even more today.
He added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long-term barriers to protecting its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I am not happy to continue paying the council fee if the Council cannot even prevent such a thing.
One local resident who wanted to remain anonymous also said, “It’s ridiculous. At the time we saw the last of these migrants leaving, and there’s a new attack.
This time, the number has grown, and even the horse has been seen in the grassland.
A representative of the Solihull Council said: “We are aware that there is an unacceptable campground in the nearby country of Streetsbrook, and we work with the Solihull police. We are building the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
The collection of evidence is very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them.
The Weekend festival is also visited by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is pleased to see that the real world’s top names have been brought to Estonia.
The question of why it is so important for the Estonians of the Weekend festival, Saar answers that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the full breast of the festival for three days.
However, he says that the real people in his area have arrived in Pärnu.
“Looking at the level of the artists that have been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre are brought home, which is often not the case in our country,” said the Minister of Culture.
What artists perform at the festival, however, are most likely to speak of Saar?
I think I'm a relatively old man, and I'm sure one of the most experienced artists in Armin van Buuren, who came up last night.
According to his record, all of us at some point have been struggling themselves, he says.
However, he adds several names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, we are also our own Estonian makers: starting with the NOṣP and they can be read in a whole series.
In reality, the concentration of known names is very high, he says.

Audi renews up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of criticism hit by car manufacturers
The day before Audi announced, BMW said that it would offer software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to BMW’s chairman, the company believes that there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions, referring to European cities, including BMW’s hometown Munich, which have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it would renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engine emissions.
No company described these operations as a call back.
European car manufacturers have strongly advertised the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
In addition, the cost of equipment installed to neutralise the exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles will increase for automotive companies, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German automobile manufacturers are under in-depth investigation, the U.S. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government is also accused of spoiling powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring the signs that indicate the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen errors that silenced the use of so-called fraud equipment that allowed the emission gas display to be adapted to the regulations at the time of testing the car, but withdrew back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been accused in the United States and others are under investigation from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Last month, the former head of the Audi Department of Motor Development was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may go to court in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was brought to a criminal investigation on Volkswagen in Germany, when the authorities accused the Audi in the installation of the system in order to circumvent the requirements of European emissions, thereby extending the investigation that had been focused on the United States in the past.
The involvement of the Audi in the investigation can be a major boost for Volkswagen by the manufacturer of luxury cars generates a disproportionate proportion of Volkswagen’s profits.
Estonian schools receive €20,000 for European Union flags.
The Ministry of Education plans to buy the European Union tickets to Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the presidency.
In total, 105x158 centimetres of the European Union flag receive 570 educational institutions.
The flags are designed to be exhibited indoors, they must be performed in high-quality printing equipment indoors also with tunnel fasteners, conveying the ERR news portal.
The flag rod label reads: “The condition for Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The expected cost of 570 tickets is 20 000 euros at the price of the Ministry of Education, i.e. one ticket costs 35 euros.
Journalist murder emphasizes a growing threat situation in Mexico
On Wednesday, Riodoce employees usually gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, which is sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They are told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior writers will discuss which one seems safer: either bring the children to the office, which was the target of the grenade attack in 2009, or leave them home.
The security experts have written three words on the frontboard of the space: “The enemy, the neutral, the allies,
They ask reporters to name each column to provide evidence that is not needed, enough impressions and senses.
A list of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being paid by governments or cartels, who make the coverage of the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
According to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, the majority of these journalists who make up the country do not have a breathtaking break, and the greater the deaths of the population across the country, the majority of them have been reported by President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012, at least 25,589 journalists have been killed and killed in at least seven states.
The latest deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug abuse.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence can be perceived everywhere on the facade of the Riodoce building hangs a big picture of Valdez, showing the average finger, along with a letter entitled “Right” and two 30s reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing a T-shirt with a smiled face or a typical Panamaan hat.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death. Reporters will discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate public prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, only two cases have been taken into account by the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Like most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, the number of which goes to thousands, journalists are rarely brought to court.
Riodoce continues to reflect violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the information and justice of the killers, the security meeting said Ibarra does not make much use of it.
“It’s hard to waste time at this meeting,” he says.
“Until the reason is known, you’ll be distrusting everyone.”
Valdez left the state headquarters in Culiacan on 15 May.
He managed to drive only a few quarters before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla. He was forced to leave the car and was shot 12 times. It was expected to be because of the name of the newspaper, which means “two rivers” in the translation.
The armed man drove away in Valdez's car and made an accident near it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She left her and two adult children.
The rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
However, only silence is the main issue of Valdez.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the United States of America in January, Sinaloa has been one of the most bloody combat forces in the country, as rivals are fighting for the execution of a power attack.
It doesn’t matter that a person or several people are shot on the streets of Sinaloa every day, or that the cemetery is suffocated with a richly decorated double of the mausoleums of drug kings, which are larger than many living homes.
For a moment, let’s forget that the peace time refers to how valuable ports and the seaside state with drug routes to the United States is driven by only one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the risks associated with his work, Riodoce co-founder and manager Ismail Bojorquez (60) felt a huge sympathies that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first of them was the publication of an interview with the son of Guzman in February with a rival and protagonist, Damascus Lopez.
This piece of paper may have angered the sons of the suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they reached the newspaper theaters.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for the sake of his own safety after the raid was carried out in one of the newspapers that reflected the same story in another.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as a veteran reporter at Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50 dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloos was impossible to deal with the press without affecting the drug problem.
The newspaper gathered time from its bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising grew.
The reporters liked to publish powerful studies without fear of the censor and readers in a snowy edition of which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its Latin American reflections.
In the same year, Valdez won the Prize for International Freedom of the Journalists (AKK) for his courage to follow the Mexican drug history wherever it leads.
He admitted openly that he was afraid.
“I want to live on,” he said when accepting the AKK award.
Last October, he told the television channel Rompevito TV in an interview that drug trafficking was a way of living in Sinaloas.
“You have to take on a task that is accompanied by another chance to play a fool.
I don’t want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn’t say what was going on.
Riodoce's group misses Valdez, a joker who hung up like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared the embuss and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from office to the El Guayabo bar and was always sitting on the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love became fatal to him.
His death has also led them to doubt how to do their work best and stay alive.
“They don’t like to leave their women, their children, their legal businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs.”
“These things shouldn’t have been touched,” Bojorquez said.
The result is that even in the best times, strong self-control and self-sustaining.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that “the smell can be deceived... and that’s what happened to Javier.”
He and others say that the old rules in Sinaloa no longer apply, just as they do not apply to the toxic composition of tamaulipas, Verbuz, Guerreros or other states, which is home to the toxic composition of profitable smugling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In a space where Riodoce staff were gathered for security training, mobile phones were no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that only the spyware sold to governments was used to track journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two policemen were looking for relief in the shadow of the tree from a 40-degree heat.
The government ordered them to watch Riodoce's office, located in a four-story building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters were considering whether these policemen were among the 50 percent police officers whose governor himself mistrusted.
Several months have passed since the reporters have traveled to mountainous locations where control is in the hands of de facto drug gangs.
Riodoce’s release of this week dealt with three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of the former box legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story of spending government money on the Governor’s home town.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter away from the office of the prosecutor.
There was no official announcement about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows about the restaurant is a place of attraction for both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter found out from public documents that the restaurant is registered in the name of a politician who is part of an institutional revolutionary industry (IRP) in power, which dominated all the levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
Recently, several IRP Governors have been accused of widespread reflection in cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how El Chapo's son of Guzman escaped from military raids.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have been looking for Valdez's column to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
“We would have known what had happened,” said Villarreal, a 46-year-old, whose sticky bodybuilding served him with the nickname El Flaco.
“Now all channels of communication have been interrupted by our sources.”
Valdez’s office has become a storage space for labels and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and the workers of the independence have become something they never expected from activists for the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a couple of times and went to the local prosecutor's office next morning for another journalist's statement.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michigan three days after the killing of Valdez.
According to the findings of the burned body and officials, it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists have become more pronounced throughout the country and criticized as an organized protest to walkways and buildings in the phrase “SOS press”
On that day, President Bojorquez will be removed in Washington, trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
The day after Valdez's death, when he met the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused journalists of spying and killing them because of telling the truth.
After that, he asked that he be redirected from the government’s activities to elsewhere, worrying that his anger had influenced his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are organised by government officials, co-sacrifices, and the indifferent society.
In his last book “Narko magazine,” he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but are also carried out by the command of politicians and security forces who are involved in organized crime.
Last year, more than half of the attacks by journalists on police and state officials were attributed by the Media Channel Monitoring Team, Articulo 19.
“In Mexico, you die because you are being silenced,” Ramirez said.
Deaths clearly affect the blood.
No one forgets the death of Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter that was probably signed by a cartel in Los Zeta: “I am here for my reports.
Next to his decomposed head, computer keyboards and headphones rested.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others pass on the way the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo committed in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke to the drug cartel publicly in front of the front page, “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have been expelled from home or even from the country.
It's a terrible decision.
It's hard to find work in the wrong place, and they still have to hide the streets to avoid threats.
And sometimes they are persecuted, as probably happened to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in 2015 in one of Mexico's apartments three months after he left Verbuz.
Those who stay still and continue to work must dance around risk decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that drug trafficking is scaring him.
“Mexico is on his way to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
In the middle of a recent Friday, when the latest number was already locked, Riodoce editors sat on the front of the office on the sidewalk and raided the beer when suddenly all the phones began to vibrate.
In the coastal resort in Mazatlan, 19 people were killed in the firefights between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartels found in the region.
On the side of the same walkway, reporters put the news on Riodoce’s website using a mobile phone.
The front of the next day needed a change.
The Sirenes were once more surprised by the fire-fighting area.
Bojorquez's pilgrimage to the police to see if they're guarded.
If they were afraid, they didn’t show it at least.
Under the massive portrait of the founder of the newspaper, where his average finger has been seen throughout Sinaloa, Riodoce’s employees were following him.
“How to think about closing,” Bojorquez said, “when the same day Javier was killed, he asked me to send him to the streets to make a report.”
Dinosaur used protection to prevent enemies
At first glance, it seems like a shape, though quite frightening.
Scientists have now revealed the first findings of the unsuspecting presence of the dynosaurus Mona Lisa, which has been so well preserved that experts have described it as “the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.”
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that the skin covered with his hair was the color of the red-brown and his past had been somewhat \"serious\".
A report published in Current Biology described the existence as “the most well-preserved warm diode that has ever been found, and as “one of the best dinosaurs in the world.”
Fossil is a new type of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the crisis period 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation of open scientists who describe it as “very significant”
According to the National Geographic magazine, the best-preserved vegetarian is the type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was discovered on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he was mining the Suncor Millennial mine near Fort McMurray in North Africa.
He hit something that didn’t resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to look at it more closely.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrelli paleontology museum.
For the next six years, the animal was developed to dig out of 2500 pounds (1100 kilos) of land.
After all this hard work, the final result is now finally ready for the public.
“When you scream a bit of eyes, you can almost believe he’s sleeping,” said the leading author, Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrelli Museum, where the existence is exhibited.
\"It goes into the scientific journal as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur sedentary - dinosaur Mona Lisa
When his skin was examined, scientists found that this vegetarian, who was covered with warms and resembles the walking tank, was likely to be significantly endangered by meat-food dinosaurs.
It used red and white protective colors to hide from predators, and applied shadowing techniques called sheltering, and also used by many of today’s animals.
According to experts, this enabled dinosaurs to move into the surrounding area and avoid enemies, as the larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him.
This 110 million-year-old nodosaur family was first released in May and is now visited at the Royal Tyrell Palaceology Museum.
Scientists have now examined the existence and gave it the name Boreelollta markmitchelli Museum’s labman Mark Mitchell, who belonged to a team that spent more than 7,000 hours of the animal’s hard to reveal.
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of the male, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the genders on the body.
They discovered resistance - a common method of protection in the animal state, which means that the upper side of the creature was darker than the lower part.
Although resistance is widespread, the findings come as a surprise, because Boreelope is much greater than the animals living today with resistance.
This suggests that dinosaurs were actively hunting other meat-eaters dinosaurs, that evolution preferred sheltering instead of the resistance to survival.
However, most animals that use modern resistance, such as deer, sebras or scaradillis, are much smaller and more vulnerable as a crop, indicating that nodosaur had to really struggle to survive.
“The strong hunting of a dinosaur with a huge and plenty of warmth shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the age of critique could have been,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the intestines also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal to get clues about this life, including the preserved content of this intestine, to find out what the animal ate for his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell to the dead river, thereby reaching the flow of the sea, where he sank in front of the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as today in South Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely to reach far beyond the inlands.
“This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved warm skin, while it has also remained three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the age of critique.
You don’t have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it – it’s just enough to scream your eyes, and it seems like he’s sleeping.
The age of critique was the time when the huge two legs of the muscle eaters, the teropodes.
Although all of these kings in Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than from Boreelope, it could be pursued by some of his scary predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and six tons of weighty monster.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in Current Biology believe that Boreelollta was threatened after the death of the sea and this mummification mudated.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the existence of the Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in North Africa.
According to the museum, it is best preserved in a warmdinesaurus in the world, including skin and warmth, and it is a complete cone up to the hips.
These conditions were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (300 kg).
Its shoulders penetrated two 20 inches of ora.
Scientists believe that this ferocious-coated vegetarian adventured through the current West Canada until the flooded river was threatened by its open-air threat.
However, the bottom of the dinosaur burial site helped to maintain its warmth in excellent detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular individual are so well preserved that the skulls of the dinosaur are still covered by the skin’s remains.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: “This degree of survival is as rare as a lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
Exfoliated skin residues are still covered by the muscaric plates on the skull of the animal.
The right front leg lies next to him and the five toes are stretched up.
I can read the warms on his feet.
How one activist found the answer to the question “Kelle Streets”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a complete shock.
Every day after visiting New York, this resident of St. Louis sat in a room rented through Airbnb on a bed, browsing Facebook on the phone.
He got into the post of his former schoolmate.
It read: “Polishly killed an 18-year-old girl, and she still rests on the street.”
He was confused why no one else had posted this information in his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Pidemega @TheePharoah user posts were repeatedly shared on his timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis's region sent a real-time costume to Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Missouris in Ferguson.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
\"It's crazy,\" Ferrell thought about himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone down, but later this evening he saw a re-scratch that announced that this time people would gather at Canfield Drive.
They shared photos of police and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown’s father and still kept a letter “Ferguson police killed my unarmed son.
He looked at a stream in real time, where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a dog.
In another video, another police officer pulled a gun and shouted, \"I'll kill you all... animals.\"
Ferrell remembers how he got hit with the idea: “It’s unusual.
“It’s not the kind of murder we’re used to and what we could call typical.”
I felt scared at that moment.
I was angry and crying.
He booked a return flight and went home the next day.
When he landed at 23am, he went to his father for his six-year-old daughter and decided to drive with the two of Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson in the next three years is the central theme in the new documentary “Whose Streets” – “Who Streets?” – which is premiered in cinemas on 11 August.
This is the story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and stamina of those who live in this community and who met the answers in demand of the streets.
When Ferrell and his daughter, who had a flower dress on their back and had a suitable crown on their head - Ferruson, they spoke again on a topic that they had repeatedly talked about before that morning - about the experiences and living conditions of blacks.
“Do you remember when I taught you how to fight for your rights?
\"We're going to Ferguson right now, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right.\"
“I couldn’t take her with me,” Ferrell said later.
“What’s happening now is a climination in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activism and organization, and at the same time also know the different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we need to do to get free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise her so that she doesn’t experience her self-sacrificed racism, she doesn’t differ from another black girl.
I feel like I would make him a fury if I were to protect him from this world.
The first stop they made when they arrived at Ferguson was on the road to South Florissant - the police station across the road, which had become a certain type of campground, where activists were waiting for news about police officer Darren Wilson, who was not finally charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined the local business owner who made lunch.
They put together food bags and helped them share them with protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism was slowly taken.
“My activist changed completely after August 9,,” he said, noting that when he was a student at Missouri-St. Louis University, he was president of the Association of Minor Nurses and focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no organizational experience.
It all just went down.
Several weeks later, at the dinner demonstration, Ferrell met with a film co-director Sabah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and the film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farran just wanted to document what was happening.
The question arises: “Do you try to document what is happening or find a story that can be used?
Such skepticism was due to countless cases where people, often whites, come to the community and try to cut the benefits of its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not heard, and we wanted to do otherwise.”
Folayan had already hit his hands with co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the region who was known for activistism in connection with sentenced prisoners.
His involvement changed the project’s binding Ferrell and the six other locals who were watched by the film “Whose Streets” after Brown’s shooting for years.
“In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, but we speak for ourselves,” Davis said.
“For me, it was important how these people were portrayed, because this is how I was portrayed.”
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience - the desire to show that the movement was not a “loud guide” but a community meeting – as Folayan said, he was the most open participant in the film.
As a result, “What Streets – surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as love and marriage with his wife.
“I felt like I was naked,” Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the finished linen.
“But I realized that the humanisation of this work and black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability.”
Moreover, Ferrelli’s story emphasizes and re-enters the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement who thought in social media in 2012 after the killing of Black Teen Trayvon Martin, the topic reference #BlackLivesMatter is homosexual.
“In the leading role black homosexual women have kept moving all over the world,” Ferrell said, “and this is precisely because we constantly have to fight on several fronts.
Black gay women have to wear this whole load.
Folayan agreed, stating that “the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women.”
However, he claims that “it is not a type of creation of equal opportunities – Ferrelli did not choose the center of the film because of his identity.
“He was a man who was flushing the right energy,” he said.
“But this is not a coincidence that he was directly located on the front line, because as a black homosexual woman living at such nodes there is much at stake.
Its energy can be perceived through the screen.
At the same time, news cameras from Ferguson have long gone, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
During the demonstration to Ferrell, the conditional penalty for blocking the road will last another 2.5 years.
He describes the social policy atmosphere in the area he calls home, simply as “a wasteful bomb.”
However, he still considers the mantra to be important, which he has eaten in memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson all three years ago.
“Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.
7 steps to get over from the north after the Weekend party
Some of the toughest guys find that after a nap party, it's also helpful.
Or based on the saying, “Always the north, stay drunk.”
But it's just an inevitable delay and a decent recovery for health.
What can you do to make sure that after today and tomorrow the Weekend trall - or another party - you feel better in the morning and get over the North as painless as possible?
Drink water.
Alcohol down and down, after a big party in the morning... or, if possible, instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid when drinking alcohol, it has to be recovered somehow.
In addition to water, minerals are also threatened from the body, and soap is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after squeezing, it is especially good if it is soil-free or simply lightly gasmed.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure it wouldn't cost you to go to your grandmother's house to break trees - it could prove fatally false.
But a light walk helps the body remember what it feels like to be alive again.
Licking in tents and lying out of the ground is a more time-consuming way of planning.
Give your body energy back slowly and carefully.
If you’re too drunk yesterday, it’s not worth trying to load a large fat steak.
For example, start with fresh juice, where the fruit sugars in your body are still in the market.
If the health of the south is already affected, you could try a wedding, for example.
And a little later on.
Get out of coffee.
This diuretic will release your body from the last water.
As already said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent the juice in the evening, your liver will also have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and lose performance.
That way, you will ruin your liver even more, and in the future, it will be worse.
In addition, painkiller does not persist in the body for a long time.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it with an empty stomach - it will irritate you so much.
Or if you don't have a partner, you get along well with yourself.
It affects around the same way as walking, but walking doesn’t get orgasm.
However, avoid too active pace and turnips - the physical effort should be moderate during the porcelain period.
You've got to be kidding me.
Make a stupid talk with friends-cuckolds, make simple nonsense and laugh friendlyly about yourself and others (stamps).
A joke and a laugh may not make fun of it, but it will certainly be more fun with them.
One day, the bay will go over anyway!
Professor Northwestern and employee at Oxford University are wanted as suspects in the murder
Police claim that the professor of Northwestern University and the employee of the University of Oxford, who have become suspects since the discovery of a man's body in one of Chicago's luxury apartments with deadly stab wounds.
According to the case-laws of the Cook County, the arrest warrants for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were issued on Monday due to their alleged connection with the death of Trenbolone H. James Cornell-Duranleaau.
According to the documents, a 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleaau died after repeated stabging.
According to a warning, the Chicago Police Department issued to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
Police got a phone call and found the Grand Plaza apartmentr when he arrived for a victim whose body had multiple stab wounds.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleaau was declared dead at the scene of the incident and the investigators refer to the killing, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a co-author of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Vice-President for Public Relations Alan K. Cubbage said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from work and is prohibited from entering the cities of Northwestern University.
“This is now the case with a criminal investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is working with investigators,” Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior in the financial department of Oxford University.
A representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: “We have been in contact with the British police and ready to help US research agencies in every possible way.”
In addition, it was stated in the statement that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
Director of the Chicago Police Department Communications Department Anthony Guglimeli strongly recommends that the suspects give up themselves to the authorities.
“Police has a idea where they are staying, but we are increasingly engaged in defining the exact location,” Guglimelim said.
According to Guglim, suspects can be sought by both local, regional and national authorities.
Guglimeli said that the police got a phone call from the Grand Plaza apartment manager who had just received a cryptic tip that the apartment no. 1008 had just happened.
According to police records, it was a good sight.
It is not clear whether the event itself took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirm the presence of Lathemi and Warren in the building.
“We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglimeli added.
The Grand Plaza’s management sent a letter to the inhabitants: “There are currently events working on the identification of the chronology and victim’s background and exploring different motives, including the possibility that it was a family village.
Businesses that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Árttt wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees in his e-commerce start-up company, but the polls were useless.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
“This system simply wasn’t consistent and objective,” said Edult, who runs an e-commerce company that sells hair care products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he invited outside people to help.
There are new types of start-ups dealing with human resources that help businesses find out what their employees are feeling.
In developing and licensing software, which is determined to measure employee involvement, they allow companies to carry out sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide anonymity and a hot line of complaints to employees, and in some cases allow language carriers to go through C-level managers and turn directly to the management board.
“Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit designed to monitor your health, but with Fitbit for your company,” asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO Redwood City in the start-up company Glint, whose software analyst companies use to measure employee involvement.
According to Mülett, he has been given a much better overview of what his employees think and feel in three years when he has been using Glint.
In addition to sudden studies and surveys on specific teams, it offers a corporate thermal card that provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to find out the reasons.
Companies have begun to realize that they need to keep in mind their working culture, so as not to become the next Uber, which has been incarnated in scandals since the former employee published a blog post that described the atrocious environment in which they were punished for those who dared to speak.
For start-ups like Glint, there is an overview of the desire to have a profitable business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance sector can be worth more than $111.7 billion by 2020, according to the Financial Technology Statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
In Denver Colorado, a start-up company, Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, observed this year the growing interest and activity in the background of Uber’s suspicious reputation.
Convertent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
As Glintki, the Convercent lets companies send customized pulse surveys, collect real-time confidential answers, and look at thermal cards from problematic areas.
It also offers an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And if the CEO is concerned, the complaints will go directly to the board.
“The opinion has been analyzed by the regulatory authorities,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if it is found that the company treats its employees badly or behaves unfairly, the company may face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, employee leaving and cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not interfere.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has used the Convercent for more than a year to ensure employee awareness of rules and activities and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the telephone number or email address of the corporate headquarters, file an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a painful and uncomfortable process, said General Counselor James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
However, now that the company uses the Convercent, there are potential problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that did not arrive in the past to managers who acted in offices in other cities or states, to identify and deal with them more quickly.
“I can get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of employees,” Vitrano said.
“And we protect our shareholders from disputes with our employees.”
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, i.e. after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in relation to Enron's scandal.
But only when “social media became mature” did companies realize that they could not stop washing their black laundry publicly on the internet.
“Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Converter provide their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity to approve venture capital investors who have been supporting both start-ups.
In February, the Convertcent financed $10 million of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the value of the capital raised to $47 million.
Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing the company’s total funding to $60 million.
Such investments will not come as a surprise if they take into account the link between businesses, culture and venture capital.
More research shows that modern workers expect more from work than before.
In competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the bets on the table.
Employees want to know that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy in the company, they feel that they are being listened to and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, who is the vice president of the general benefit and employee experience, LinkedIn, who uses both the Convertent and the Glint.
Investors earn income when their portfolio companies are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytics tools allow for increased employee commitment and involvement, it is no wonder that they will find support.
Having data on employee involvement is important, according to experts in the working culture.
However, these data are useless if the company’s supervisors do not do anything to them.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that there will be changes ahead.
And if change does not happen quickly or at all, it can cause disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
“When you ask about 4,000 proposals, you need to be ready for 4,000 conversations,” Kotter International President Russell Raath said in a consulting and business management company, who has seen how businesses make a mistake by relying on too much data collection.
“When things don’t end, the workers think, “Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?
According to Mattert, Madison Reed, who is currently conducting six studies among employees, has been able to implement the measures on the same day as the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees who were disappointed in the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to restructure several teams in the company and provide communication training to address problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, collects new data on employees and hopes that in the long run it will lead to long-term employee commitment in the industry, which is known for its high labour flow.
“If you’re not committed to ensuring transparency, you lose people,” Vitrano said.
“And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses.
The bright star of the euro area is Baltic: incomes are growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the incomes of Western Europe's wealthy countries, Bloomberg writes the European Central Bank's report.
According to the central bank, the total output of the economy per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania since 1999.
There is a low debt burden behind success, rapid improvement of institutions and business and free market-friendly policies.
“Baltic countries in one Slovakia are a few euro area countries where real-SKP per person is significantly closer to the EU average,” the central bank said.
Although the aim is to ensure that the total output of the economy per capita is equal to that of the richer Western Europe, in 2015, the total production of the Baltic economies per capita represented only 2/3 of the average of 15 countries belonging to the European Union before the enlargement of 2004.
Low wages have led the Baltics to look for a better salary from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy grows this year, the local residents are not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies are doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, this was thought by a little less than half of the respondents to their economies.
NCAA’s decision to cancel twice a day trainings that take place in Bruins’ days for a long time
It is almost 23 o’clock when UCLA footballers stop to chat on the edge of a new training course in the team’s campus.
Some of them have peeled off the shirt, revealing their first day of the workout camp's efforts to sweat back.
For most of the team, they offer a midday break.
In the summer courses, players will return to the final exams after three hours of training before they return to the Waserman football centre for meetings at 6.30 a.m. next morning.
“The next three days are a real trial for them,” said coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday.
NCAA’s decision to cancel twice a day’s workouts to reduce player’s workload, has actually made their days longer – at least until the final exams are received on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA’s first three workouts were scheduled to start at 19.15 to fit the players into a tight schedule.
The transition from two trainings per day means more than one training day - the beginning of the Bruins training camp was raised from the previous season to almost a week ahead and for the first time during Mora's six Westwood seasons during summer courses.
They will have up to 20 August 18 trainings before the official preparation for the opening game in September against Texas A&M.
According to Mora, he is in favour of the changes in the NCAA rule, although it adds another item to the close charts of players.
“They have a huge load on three or four days and this is a serious challenge,” Mora said.
“And they will break themselves through this trial; they will tighten, they will be fine young.
I think when it comes to Saturday and we have more time, it’s really nice –
Once the camp is finished, UCLA’s trainings will be closed, which is not an easy task, taking into account a clear view of the parking area close to their squares and the adjacent center of Luskin, a higher class hotel that has already been hit by footballs that have reached the gate post from the surrounding defense network.
Since this weekend, the Bruins players are taking over the hotel, but Mora admitted that problems can occur with free rooms during the season.
“We’re building security measures,” Mora said.
“It’s a real worry, and it’s not exaggerated to think people can rent a room and a workout.
If you have a recording of your workout, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we're using a security team in the parking lot and 8th.
We are doing the best we can.
I'm trying not to worry about it very much.
We have a plan in place.
The Savisaare-Ivanova Electoral Association, Kristiina Ojuland, and Maria Kaljuste, who is forced to leave the Reform Party to join the forces of Maria Kaljuste, was born to the Central Party, to show the creative selection of businessmen Tegus Tallinn - it seems that the electoral alliances created by the party's initiative will participate in the local elections this year at least as much as the political parties.
The chicks are considered in the autumn, and the key question is whether they are divided by sufficiently disappointed voters.
Who's with Savisaar?
If the support team of Edgar Savisaare has been reduced, it may not be possible to know the events organised in honor of his election union.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and present middle political parties and many unknown faces - will such be the composition of the electoral union?
And can the reason why some of Savisaare’s loyal followers and friends refrain from applying for a job in Tallinn be sought for the fact that the perpetrators’ list of Sasaares, which are in the first place suspected of corruption and corruption crimes, are becoming real?
The music video filmed on the roof of the city government to the Russian pop singer, in which the senior of the district of Lasnamäe participates; and in any sense, the original computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must, when driving the wheel, avoid the wallets and squirrels that hit the road - does the Central Party for the first time seek the votes of 16 and 17-year-old voters who are allowed to vote for election boxes?
We look forward to the idea of other political parties of a youthful election campaign.
If the Channel 2 or TV3 is viewing the black square from the beginning of August instead of the entertainment show, there are two options: to accept that it will see only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and French24 channels, or to hand over every month to some television operators.
There are probably also those who initially enjoy advertising-free television experience, but at the end of the day - even if they are reluctant - pay for telegraphs and advertisements.
The surrounding music, the noisy people and the ruins left on the streets are the unpleasant side effects of every major music festival.
If you don’t want to get a part of the noise, it’s worth going to the home to discover the country – and leave it to the festival guests instead of the pain of the head.
Washington changes the green card rules
The media release is quoted by President Donald Trump, who said there is a new U.S. immigration plan that changes the rules of the green card.
The plan foresees a reduction of the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people per year, more stringent rules on the purchase of temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The bill goes to Congress in two houses to discuss.
“This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money, as it changes the way U.S. citizens receive green cards.
The law reduces chain migration and begins to replace the current program.
The new application process benefits candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that come to our economy,\" Trump said.
The Siberian Seto young people move back to the city, the pensioners return to the country.
Jevseev Anatol continues the tradition of the once-in-a-a-day Seto of famous gold miners.
He works 140 km from home as a car driver at the Kui Square.
This is a hard job: two months in a row without holidays, 12 hours of work, and then only 10 days at home and again.
In the course of the three years worked at the Artelli, Anatol has seen only once.
“It’s a hard time: when you go in, you’ll be thoroughly checked so that you don’t bring the wine and go out so that you don’t take the gold with you,” Anatol says.
Mare Piho is talking to the local Seto Jaan in the village of Haida, who has told her a lot about the memories of her family in Siberia.
The still preserved archaic culture of Siberian Setos will also affect home-setos, as it is just so fabulous, thinks the most thoroughly distant sets of researched by Piho Mare.
Her first visit to Siberia will take 30 years this year.
During this time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many sets of people went out to Siberia in the late 19th century and the early 20th century to get land here?
This is an unsolved question.
I'm saying 8,000.
I calculated it according to Siberian Seto's men's stories, who have been thinking about it myself.
It is difficult to say exactly because at that time one group could come up to 30 people, but only a passport was granted to a man.
The passport was only given to one, but he had children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look how big this territory was here!
It was many times bigger than historical Setomaa.
It was necessary to educate, manage, in some way.
Sethoes came here as peasants, but their lives changed because here they came into areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (powdering), the gold mines, the industry.
For example, in New Pezers, many sets later worked in the classified city of Krasnojarsk-45 (you built the Soviet power of the uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the sets form the majority of the population at that time?
Yes, they lived in a compact way.
In addition, a long tradition of marriage and multiplicity remained.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How much does the culture of Siberian Setos differ and differ from that of the Motherland Seto?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same.
They brought a lot of folk clothes.
They did it themselves, but they always did the difference that was brought along and that was done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional clothing of the Setos, because it's colder here.
Food changed.
For example, meat was salted in Setomaa, but it was just frozen here.
Where are the villages of Siberian Setos, and what is the life there? / Graphics: Alari Paluots
The relationship with the motherland was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now Setumaa is going to give it back to it, and it's starting to affect them.
Those girls who have lived in this family have listened to amazing stories.
Piho considers the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to the village of Haida in early July for the day of the Seto kingdom and lived four days in the homes - J. P.
What's still here is amazing.
“It’s very easy to come and leave, because the city has a great location: in the railway station and in the crossing of roads,” says the Tapa Operaist Reigo Tamm.
The city is no longer just a military city, we have a lot of nature, sports and culture sites, and the pizza can be found in every corner.
Kill is a top-notch city!
There is a small island running through the city, where the killers tend to have a jaani party.
“This beautiful place doesn’t look like a train window,” Reigo says.
Anyone who is not afraid of cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of sources.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
On the water of the river, you can keep a picnic and just make romance – you can look at the river and think about life in advance and behind.
I've been walking with my brides too.
In addition to everything else on the riverside, the opera Tamm has been working on three bridges: “This place is at the edge of the city, no one may come up against you when his own stories are beating.”
“There is a wonderful view of Tapa on the ground, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter, and today, for example, discolf to play - the golf course has been made, the chains can be borrowed from the sports centre,” Reigo leads.
I mean, the old pros go there with their own discs, but I haven't been there yet.
I think Mr. Rasmus Kul will have to call a visit to Tape because he is an experienced discolf player and has discs.
He's gonna lend me!
Reigo and Männnikämägi were inseparable from the current opera saltist’s childhood.
At least during the ski hours.
There are many tears, disappointments, and you may be in my sports life.
Not to mention broken snails and skis.
“The entire city is now full of construction works, all this becomes unknown,” Reigo says.
However, the old and tired resort is a very attractive place to play summer discoveries.
I am pleased that in 2012, R.A.A.A.M. Director Märt Meos accepted my idea and came to make a summer theater with his theatre.
Although this year’s theatre season with Aleksei Karenin was just over, on 11 August, the railway station “Ellumination” is where the old blind house moves around in the 1980s.
“until August 11-13, the City of Tapa has been awakened by open cafes and cultural events, including the folk rally, the city of Tapa, who just recommends visiting the town of 91 years of age.
In a small yellow house on May 1st, the museum has been in 1994.
“The house is small, but the exponents are very much and the information is huge,” Reigo states the place full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on railways and warfare.
Reigo remembers that if you go through all the recommended places in Tapa, the stomach will be empty for a long time, but fortunately, the small city is filled with coffee.
“We have such good places to eat and sitting in coffee shops sometimes feel like you’re abroad,” he describes.
The trained and young soldiers who came to Tape spend a lot of time in pubs-coffees, which makes it strange to sit there that you are in Estonia and in your home town, but around them there is such an international community together.
I think it would be very exciting to listen to stories from French or American.
Soldiers, yeah, we're moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
The TV channel bTV cited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
On August 1, the police arrested a group of illegally camping people in the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation is currently being conducted.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV channel BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already introducing severe traumas for anyone who is missing by resting in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Dogs teach wolves to break sheep.
After the year, the Hiiumaa farmers must return to the wolves from their herds, “teaching material – apparently the wolves who have taught puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
I had only three numbers, one year earlier, 124.
The data from the Environmental Agency is also in sync with the fractures, that the Hiiumaal Wolfs were not born this year and the Hiiumaa Hunting Council information that this year two wolves have been fixed on the island.
On Monday, the wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna, Emmaste, and injured 18 surviving sheep.
On Wednesday morning, wolves broke one sheep in the village of Reheselja, and severely injured another who had to be killed.
The rules for the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft amending the GMOVS Act and the Plant Protection Act to the coordination circle.
The amendment to the Act will waive the creation of a separate database for both genetically modified (GM) crops and for operators, and will continue to be used in the register of plant health.
In addition, the GM farmer’s obligation to have a prior agreement with a person engaged in beekeeping within the prescribed radius is amended.
Although at the moment there are no genetically modified crops in Estonia, we consider it necessary to establish clear rules for the co-existence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least as long as it has not been decided to declare the Estonian GMO free,” said Sigmar Suu, head of the Department of Plant Health of the Ministry of Rural Development.
\"It must also be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden of both the private and public sectors,\" Suu added.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the data collection and handling training of GMOVS sites and operators of GM crops, lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and for the commencement of economic activities.
In particular with regard to honey, the GM farmer’s obligation to inform the honey bee of the start of cultivation of GM crops with the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with bee before the start of cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to examine it in the draft information system and, if they so wish, to present their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The proposed changes will affect in particular the persons, bee and the Agricultural Board operating in the field of plant production.
Only one GM crop in the European Union, including Estonia, is allowed to grow - maize MON 810.
Until now, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops.
The reason for this is that there is no corn pest in Estonia, the European varietal feed for which maize MON 810 is resistant.
The varieties of this maize line are also cultivated in southern regions, and this May is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies to detect potential GM organisms in the seeds of different types of summerraps, maize and soy grown in Estonia.
The analysis results of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and as a result it was concluded that the seeds of rape, maize and soy varieties grown in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that there is no conscious cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia and also that no accidental contamination has occurred.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United was recruited by Nemanja Matic in the form of \"genus\"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has recruited Nemanja Matic on the face of \"genius\", after the mid-range player against Sampdoria made his debut Wednesday night.
The player bought 40 million pounds of Chelsea in the last pre-season game of the United States in Dublin, before Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid in the first round of 2-1 wins on Tuesday, with an impression of a defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on the raids.
However, after leaving the Blues’ pre-season Asian tour, Maticul was suddenly missed by a busy match form and only held for 45 minutes. According to Mourinho, this must be improved before the beginning of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant mindset – he has the mood of football,” Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him achieve the form as soon as possible.”
Like Matic, the Aviva stadium began in the early stages with the other new recruits Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku, and Mourinho quietly began to place one of his initial men at the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho would still want to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed that the club had already done a “great job” by concluding contracts with three of his four priority choices.
“I am grateful to the club for being able to realize three out of four,” he added.
“I’m even happier than they can do four out of four, but they’ve worked hard for me.”
Another solo dog got a foot on GSM transmitter on August 1st and then Muhus.
According to Mat Martinson, a bird-watcher living in the desert, the first pick-up boy in the Sõrke, and this nest is already flying around, has left the nest and joined the large collection of nights in the Mullutu-Surlah.
This is because there is no crop field in Sõrö, the Saarte Voice writes.
On Tuesday, to ring the cucumbers, it was relatively late, and another curly boy got to the escort and it was on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
In the meantime, a boy named Matti GSM was supplied with the Sõrös Tyjul.
“He’s doing everything on the internet: how he went to winter in Spain, returning to the border of Germany and Poland for a while, and then he came to Saaremaa,” Martinson said.
The British inventor had to install a microchip in his body to get to the house and car with a hands-off.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed, so that he could open his front door with a hand-off only, get to the office and even run the car.
A 33-year-old Steven Northam had to install a small chip between his thumb and a fingertip and now offers this service through his own company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make it easier with their technology.
He has joined forces in the Hampshire County Royal Hospital with Dr. Geoff Watson to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
Technology is similar to that of a microchip installed on cats and dogs and only takes 30 seconds to process.
Northam’s company also replaces the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, asking for a lock of 300 pounds.
This married father of one child has now installed technology both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which will start when his hand is on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibit went to pay thousands of taxpayers.
According to the military documents published by TIME, the White House’s decision to fly a Navy helicopter last month to pay nearly $24,000 for the South Outdoor taxpayers for an American production event.
The green and white color Sikorsky VH-3D, called Marine One, was the central attraction of the American construction program that took place in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and the senior officials of the White House, renewed industrial products from all 50 states on their tour.
The helicopter built by Connecticut was exhibited together with the hunt from Maine, the firefighter from Wisconsin and the cannon support made in Mississippi.
According to documents by Marine Heliopter Squadron One (HMX-1) responsible for the operation of the helicopter, the presence of the White House Military Cabinet with the helicopter was required at least 36 hours before the helicopter was landed in the south of the yard for the purpose of the “unusual” event.
“I knew you’d be aware of this because it’s an unusually important event,” HMX-1 commander said a day before the event to his e-mail officer, a senior officer of the Navy in the field of aviation.
It was noted in the message that the helicopter would arrive on the south side of the morning of 17 July at around 5 p.m. and will remain there until the evening between 18 and 21 p.m...
It was added that if leaving the White House should stay, there is a need for another ekipaasi due to the limitations of working time.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the Eskadari security team remained close to the aircraft for the entire period of its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to read the documents given to TIME whether the other ekipaži was eventually needed or not.
The Hatchi Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether this event could violate this provision.
“We asked if it would violate Hatchi’s law, and we were told not to violate it,” the commander wrote.
“It seems you don’t have a choice,” replied the Chief Officer’s deputy.
The White House declared the event as an official event in America, and the Hatchi Act would not have covered it.
But even in official events, there are political alatons.
At the time of the event, the president supported the efforts of the health reform in the Senate and praised the efforts to keep government regulations under control.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them as a purely photo scene is unusual.
Trump was paid attention in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, was in the background of a president's plane, and his Twitter account piles up messages that complain about how his predecessor's president used his plane.
“The White House is very pleased with the exhibition “made in America” where the products were represented from all 50 states made from American materials by American workers,” said White House spokesperson Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 teams often try to train US President White House with centimeter accuracy around Washington and in the south.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, the HMX-1 White House organized 58 attempts to land in the yard.
According to the official, the flight was considered to be part of the \"American-made\" flight crew's standard of the month's flight.
The Eskadar helicopters also flew that day for 11 hours to non-president-related support missions.
According to the White House, none of the other exhibitors of this event charged the taxpayer's wallet.
According to the representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in the organisation of the demonstration in the south of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not keep the president's budget documents and the exact cost of the event is difficult to identify.
However, according to the annual prices of the Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017, the compensation rate for VH-3D is $24,380 per hour of flight.
The Eskadari documents indicated the length of the flight from its base to the Navy at the Quantico airport in both directions of 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is far below this amount.
“The calculation of payers’ costs based on estimated compensation rates is very misleading,” Walters said.
‘These estimated compensation rates include staff, maintenance and many other irrevocable costs to be taken into account for annual appropriations,
According to the 2015 RAND study, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include personnel costs, although they cover the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracts.
The former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the time of the event.
“The idea is to show you things made this week in America,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security and that hundreds are expected to exist if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have been working tirelessly on.
So, of course, it is right to highlight it –
It is not clear whether Trump was in contact with or not with the helicopter in the middle of the event, but he was behind the fire-fighting car.
Inside the White House, Trump Sikorsky turned to representatives, throwing fun at the media outlets over the company’s products in his personal aviation park.
\"I know Sikorsky very well,\" the president said, \"I have three products.
Grit Šadeiko - through tears came peace and joy
In 2011, Daegus hit Šadeiko in the last area, 800 m ran into the foot ramp and was taken from the stadium with the pier.
Just before that, he had become a zero on the universe held in China.
In 2012, the EMI in Helsinki had a low-cost injury, but at the debut Olympics in London, he was ranked at 6013.
However, the misconception continued.
After the opening day in 2013, Moscow MM received an Estonian remoteness leap of thumb in the chart of the Estonian record.
Two years later, he was ranked 15th in Beijing’s World Cup and filled with the Olympic norm, but he also wanted more to be disappointed by the athlete.
The toughest kadalpupu was passed by Šadeiko only in the past, when the original Amsterdam EM failed to get the result of the letter.
I'd just like to put together a good multi-party competition once or for all.
Once upon a time, Šadeiko held.
The worst was yet ahead: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was interrupted by the first truck.
Is it time to take off - to continue with seven competitions?
Is the effort of two days worth all this?
She thought for a long time, but found peace in herself.
I got my head clean.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I’ve been thinking that last season and Rio Olympia were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and to think clean.
“I knew I wasn’t putting the pill in the bag yet,” Shadeiko talks about my self-cleaning.
I was able to turn a clean page and move on with a new pace.
According to Coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the sufferings under the care, but he realized that in particular, the athlete had to find out for himself.
He was so buried by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
“Grit said he didn’t give up, and he wants to prove to himself what he deserves,” says Mägi.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He's doing this for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May, when Šadeiko erected a new Estonian record of 6280 at the Gothenburg Multi Contest.
In a high-level competition, he improved his personal peak mark by nearly a meter (13.89) and ran the barrier to record-close time.
Then, the multi-competitor felt that it was not the ceiling of abilities, but the erased only became the first stage of competition.
He has been guided by the mountain for years, saying that Šadeiko is a master’s student.
He's an athlete, he's good to train.
If something is wrong or wrong, he'll say it right away.
He feels his body and trusts his feelings.
That's what we need to do.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and we'll follow it.
A new approach has also been found by Šadeiko.
“I’m not the one who does the maximum in training, he’s talking and saying that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
Close baby happiness makes you happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Šadeiko by the blessing of the loved ones.
Both his former training companion Maris Mägi and sister Grete have recently become parents and multi-competitors have received support from new weather citizens.
“It’s been interesting,” says Šadeiko.
One drink that is equivalent to the brain – training –
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that he believes - with wine, the brain can be trained better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
In his words, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the process of “very active” wine taste.
By smelling the glass, turning in the mouth of the wine, enjoying it and realizing the aftertaste, we put our brains on to work to create a taste for the wine.
According to Sheperdi, wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but taste is created by the way the wine stimulates the brain.
It is a comparison of how the brain looks – colors.
“The taste is not in the wine, the taste creates the wine taster,” says Sheperd.
Things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender, and even the number of spits that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, insists that wine is not enough to drink full.
“There must be more in action,” he says.
If you take too much of the hips, the system is overexploited.
Excessive drinking of wine can harm the brain instead of profit - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental ability are at risk.

According to the UN, the role of Afghan democracy in politics depends on women.
On Wednesday, the Head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan said that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women are candidates in local council elections, three women are nominated as Vice President, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
\"It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of women's role,\" he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent and be credible only when women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The elections and presidential elections of the Afghan local councils will take place on 5 April.
Taliban has threatened by itself the electoral process that coincides with the transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes acceptable.
This year's elections will mark the first time that power will peacefully be handed over from one democratic government to the next.
According to Haysom, women’s strong role increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the independent election committee of Afghanistan, 1.6 million registered voters are 1.2 million women.

From the Philippines to the heart of the Moephant
Oil-plated bags are summer classics, which have become a separate hit product in recent years, which must be hung at the top of the hand by one of the right souvenirs, and which, despite its modest origin, the merchants have been able to boil up the price tag.
A bag of beads is probably one of those things that have existed every time in life and which has not been created by having special emotions.
It's just there, and if it's not, there's nothing broken.
But now the shoulder bags have made a real race, and the fashion fans have changed their fine design bags for summer months against the bags that were pulled from simple shoulders.
This is not just a beach bag, but today it is also so popular as a street bag, and braver women even walk to the office with it.
However, it is worth noting whether the summer loop like the boss still sits or pays the wet and the laptop to be pushed to a slightly more formal sumatan.
However, the wealth of mediation has made women’s true summer love.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing to see is that the fashioners raise the local market as a first thing on the holiday trip and buy a shoulder bag to which the rest of the rest of the holiday is rested and which comes along on the beach, the market and the city with friends.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a larger pile of bags from the market and sell or sell them to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that there is so much demand among the readers that in the real world women (and men!) probably go hand in hand to each other to become a happy owner of some bags.
In some ways, such madness is also understandable, because few are the times when some of the things that have risen into the atmosphere can be bought for just a few euros.
True, clever merchants have also discovered a simple possibility of financial services here, and thus sell finer luxury brands of beer bags for a few hundred and thousand euros.
Probably, in order for richer customers not to feel simple, who are promenating around with any cheap bags.
For example, Dolce & Gabbana can buy over a thousand euro-paying shoulder bags.
However, Chanel’s shoulder bag can be translated around €6000.
Unlike most fashionians, the shoulder bags did not come from some great fashion, but their story began more distant.
The shoulder bags are supposed to come far from the Philippines, where they have been widely carried.
The flowering of a bag of beads is, in particular, an exhibitor and locals are very often not seen.
It is said to be from the 14th century of the flowering equipment, and it is quite sharp with the usual corpuscence.
However, since the shoulder bag does not have to be as tight as the basket, they can be covered with patterns and other materials that make the bag more personal and more attractive.
For example, recently, there are particularly trendy bags, where colored caps or leather strips are packed in.
The letter of thanks may, however, be sent to the actress Jane Birkin, who had not been seen before.
He was able to fit the shoulder bag with all sorts of clothing and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
At the popularity of bags today, however, the fact that caring for them is a fallhead and unlike all other Finns, it is not necessary to care for them with special means, but also for water and wet towels.
As with trending, after the classic look, brands have come out with all kinds of interpretations.
For example, if you want to, you can buy a pendant or a small shoulder cap.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag will never go out of fashion, but it will be a shoulder.
But what is a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, it has been considered classic in a bag of straws that resembles a basket of its style, is open and short, as well as shoulders and shoulders.

GMB is worried about investing in McVitie's Glasgow factory
The company expects cookies manufacturer McVitie’s managers to confirm long-term production plans at the Glasgow factory.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has silenced the Tollcross object on the future investment.
In a factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products are produced, more than 500 people work.
McVitie's owner in Pladis said they have invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years.
The employees and the presidents of the trade union were hired when something changes in the operations of the factory.
In a letter sent to the company’s object manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie’s to “distribut concerns about the fact that funding is not used to modernize production lines”
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the object about the business needs and the investment plan of Tollcross, makes our members deeply concerned.
Here, several generations of families have worked and the workforce largely consists of the local community and the people around Glasgow, being essential to ensure a more sound employment in a region with high unemployment and social exclusion.
Thus, from the point of view of jobs, wages and well-being in the eastern part of Glasgow, and Brexit, rising living costs and the background of chronic decline in production urgently require a strong growing productivity company in McVitie
Pladis’ representative said: “The object manager of Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company responds directly to it because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between employees and GMB representatives took place in Tollcross, where several problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with our employees that, like all other highly competitive and precarious companies operating in the economic climate, we are looking at our activities in an ongoing manner - and this applies to all of our companies and objects - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: “In recent years, we have invested over £5 million in the Tollcross object, most of it has gone to production lines and to improve operations.
We fully understand Tollcross as a heritage of the production object and if any change in the activity of the object is to take place, the representatives of the employees and the trade union are the first to hear about it.
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about the approach to Neymar?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up his efforts to attract Neymar to his ranks, making an offer of 189 million pounds to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record conquest?
This grim approach has opened a summer transition window, and the League 1 club is ready to break more than double the world record of the current acquisition, which was erected last season by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for 89 million pounds.
Once the transition has been completed, Neymarist will become the most expensive player in the world and also the highest-paid professional athlete in the world who will receive more than 500 000 pounds per week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona is known to be angry about both the way it approaches and the free breaking of Neymar, although the close source to the Catalan Board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of its football player since the arrival of Santos in 2013.
But did the president warn the football world three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in the conclusion of a contract with Blaise Matadi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs thinking about recruiting some of the best players in PSG.
“I don’t worry, because they know that if they touch any of our players, we’ll face them and contact their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they are trying to sign a contract with some of our players, they must face the consequences.
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line, as the Spanish club has shown interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that they would not let the Italians leave on any terms and that Barcelona could get a kickback as a result of this interest by losing one of their precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
“Brexit is threatening to strike a grave between Northern Ireland and Ireland, the UK and Ireland,” Varadkar warned Northern Ireland on his first visit to Northern Ireland after his appointment in June.
“I can’t imagine who would benefit from it,” he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible for people and goods to move freely, Varadkar said.
“This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not boundaries,” he stressed.
He said that he would prefer Britain to be part of the European Union, and that, as it is not able to do so, he would remain a part of the European common market.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
The second option of making Britain's exit more smooth would be the creation of a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Prime Minister of Ireland.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: “We could definitely have such a deal with the UK.
An alternative to this would be a return to the customs offices, which would declare historical fragmentation and political failure.
“The barrier to trade, prosperity and peace,” the Prime Minister of Ireland said.
He called Brexit the challenge of our generation, and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland’s daily life.
The Prime Minister of Ireland met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when visiting Belfast.
The Märt Avand, who passed its first half of the triathlon: Ironman is able to pass everyone.
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltics was held in the winter capital of Otepää, when about one thousand triathletes from more than thirty countries took place at the semi-long Ironman competition.
The 70.3-mile distance consisted of 1.9 km from swimming, 90 km from cycling and 21.1 km from cycling.
Among others, the first triathlon of his life also ended with Märt Avand.
“I thought it would prove complicated and eventually it was difficult,” Avand said.
Despite the complexity, the Avand found that the triathlon was a forceful head for everyone.
“Not the distance will kill, but the pace will kill,” he said, pointing out that with a strong pace, everyone will come to the finish.
Except Ot Sepp: “It’s all right with physics, but he can’t swim.”
The Avandi had been working out a little bit since February.
At first 4-5 hours a week, later 10 hours a week.
At 05:34:12 he reached the 270th place in the overall account.
Although Avand lost both to Raiio Limit (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called ‘prominents’ in the class.
Last year, Tanel Padar lost to Avand in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
In Ironman’s series of Otepää stage men’s accounting was crowned by German John Moldan at 3:58:27, the best of Estonians was Ivo with the Great Time 04:14:09.
Among women, the Danish defeated Helle Frederis on 04:24:01, but from the Estonians Maria Jussi, who lost to Frederinsen in nearly half an hour, and by 04:58:58.
The opening passed a swimming distance of 1.9 km in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in 410.
