Emeli Kouki led Hurrikan to his home win in the opening - Savo Volley
Perät seven times in a row, the Hurrikani-Loima, on the medals of the men's volleyball, began the 2018-19 home win when Raision Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most effective of Hurrikan at 22 points.
There were a few tunes for foreign countries, but they didn't get it, and then they came out of Loimaa.
It was quickly settled, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Rumpunen played in Loimus with 18 points.
The most effective guest was Samuli Kaislasalo, a team searcher playing a match-by-party contract with 17 points.
The winning of the opening game is always important.
Many players also had experience from the opposite side, and it brought an additional display to the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but the continuation of the medal pipe is, of course, the goal, Kouki said.
Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Mättänen was 18 points the most effective of Savo Volley when the team poured out the Vantan Ducks 3-0.
Our game was a great game, especially at the end of the attack, but fortunately we got a bit of a win.
At least I didn’t have any knowledge of any different downloads when I played against my team, Mättänen said.
During the 3 series, Antti Siltala, who started her career in 2000-01, made 12 points.
Chief coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was a small, or atmosphere in the roof all the time.
Well, that's a good file for home opening.
Miro was the king, and Sil also played a good game, Tuvinen said.
The previous season of Siltalan in the league was 2006-07, then he won the silver in Pielavesi Sammo when he was the chief coach.
Thiago Maciel was the most effective 14 points in Ducks.
Mikkonen again Aka-Voley
During 2012-13 league score exchange, Joni Mikkonen has started this season strongly.
The hacker made 25 points when Aka-Voley took his opening victory after losing the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started well from its own point of view.
Today, of course, there was a loss, because we had a fourth loss in 17-21.
There was a victory, and the fifth one came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the most effective of the Tigers in the final matches was the 28-point hacker Edvarts Buivids.
Landman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported with 17 points.
There wasn't much of a pickup in the guy's search, Mikkonen said.
Finland’s human capital comparison with the world’s number one
Finland is at the top of the world in human capital comparison, according to the Scientific Journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was the number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands followed.
Later, the Netherlands was ranked one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, the worst comparison was Niger and South Sudan.
In measuring human capital, the educational level of the population, access to education, skills and health are considered.
The World Bank has directed human capital to economic growth.
Real Madrid Thibaut Courtois held under the control of Atletico, the local game ended in the goalless
Real Madrid’s goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched into a great train, and the local game of the Madrid teams ended in a goalless level on a late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest goal, but Belgian guard Courtois fought.
Courtois played in Atletico through three loan games while Chelsea was a player.
In the first week, the International Football Federation Fifa chose him as the goalkeeper of the year.
In Real, the best destination was Gareth Bale, but his shot was passed by the end of the opening half of the goal.
Bale was replaced after a break because of a travel injury.
According to ESPN, the disappointed Reali supporters shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, who moved to Juvenus.
The United States is now attacking abortion law - a powerful document tells us why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to find out if one of the top nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected by the candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by President Donald Trump.
In the Republican Party, many people hope that, with the decisive vote of Kavanaugh, a decision known against Roe against Wade could be repealed, which made an abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - The United States and abortion rights tell us how the current situation has been over the years.
As incredible as it feels, the subject is also present in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (your) has done a public job against a safe abortion and has received support from the majority of our country’s representatives.
At the beginning of the powerful document, Gynaecologist Collele McNicholas, who has remained the only abortion doctor in Missouri State, due to the tightening of the laws.
A clinic-armed guard says he's defending the American freedom of religion.
News videos remind me of the deadly attacks on clinics.
Let's move to the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the association of Lutheran churchmen guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasons for the interviewed pastor are good, but not even necessary, the photo of the woman who died of the abortion itself is enough.
Death in the United States was about 5,000 years ago.
The legalization of abortions was in particular the Republican Party.
In 1967, Governor Ronald Reagan signed an abortion law in California.
Later, Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, began to reversely confuse religion with political voters.
His abortion was also driven by George Bush's parent.
And so did Donald Trump.
The document of the deeper core of the matter reaches the ground for the politicalisation of abortion.
When tax-free religious organizations in favour of racial separation were denied, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a fucking horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary bonds to politics.
In writing this in the United States, there is a situation in which the voice of the religious right as an abortion has been challenged by the sek, but the president has chosen the highest court as candidate for sexual harassment, which many women now now blame for sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh can obtain the power based on a horizontal position to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israel's army shot seven Palestinians, including two children, at the border of great protests.
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in half a year when Israel has fired protesters in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians on Friday in the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children: 12 and 14-year-old boys.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded from the bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike in the border zone when the protesters threw the Israeli forces with stones and explosions.
The army says that they have started using force, that protesters do not break the border fence or pursue it on the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in the protests of Gaza since March, when the Palestinians began weekly protests at the border.
According to the UN Human Rights Commissioner, 12,000 are injured.
The protesters called for the Palestinian families to enter the territories where the Palestinians had to leave when the state of Israel was established in 1948.
Palestinian snipers have killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosions from the Palestinians and helium balls have set fire to forest areas and farmlands in Israel.
Teemu Puki got the punishment kick - he couldn't shoot himself.
Wigan's top partner Chey Dunkley seemed to have poured him behind with a hit-and-run area.
The Ertuomar Calvin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the guarantee was clean.
Teemu Puke couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation remained in trouble with the extermination judge Ward, who condemned Norwich for a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Puke was poured.
Ward looked like a penalty cloud, and Mario Vrancic starred 1-0.
Santa has made five goals for Norwich in the Championship series.
The previous was born last Saturday against QPR in style with breast muscle.
The work was delicious again for Puk.
After he lost the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created paints and defended himself untied.
Norwich had the fifth match in two weeks.
The team will continue in the league.
There are five winning tubes behind.
The pedophiles aid service was filled immediately with reservations - around 40,000 people in Finland are interested in children.
According to the estimates, two percent of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in their ancestors.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
So far, children or young people who are sexually interested have been difficult to get help.
The joint SeriE project between the Criminal Care Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals to meet pedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, an e-mail flight was started in Sexpo providing advice and therapy, and the meeting hours were booked very quickly, Yle says.
However, they are promised to be released during the autumn.
Sexual preference for children causes many to be ashamed.
Most of the pedophiles themselves have not carried out their fantasins or thus committed any crime.
However, the opinion is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and depress them.
They also complicate normal life, says Ylele's sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who works as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if one child is saved from sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Core Leaders or Congonic Gynaecologist?
As the winner of the US President Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may suddenly sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest winners of the prize.
Trump has a role to play in obtaining North Korea, at least at the level of speech, to commit to nuclear pollution.
The greatest favorites to be the recipients of peace in Nobel have been Kim Jong, head of South Korea's President Moon Jae and North Korea, who have met three times this year and promised to reach a peace treaty between their countries.
Warming between the Cores is remarkable, as the last year was a hyses.
Yet, for years, the reward of Kim, which leads to the threat of nuclear weapons and its country, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and on Friday the most attention will be paid, i.e. the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not awarded to participants in the Korean Peninsula diplomacy, one of the top candidates for the Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
The esteemed gynecologist has treated thousands of women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as victims of mass rape and has become a leading expert in its field in the world.
Mukwege has worked to pay attention to sexual violence, which is a harsh byproduct of many conflicts.
A strong candidate was also considered the UN Refugee Organization, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has said that this year, there are 331 candidates.
The names of the candidates will not be disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if he had a Nobel.
In May, the journalist asked him in the White House whether he felt he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself, Trump said I smiled.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, and the President continued with reference to North Korea's negotiations.
However, there are some things that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the award, has often given recognition to individuals and organizations representing liberal democracy and multi-polar world order - precisely the international cooperation that Trump has seen as opposed.
In the 21st century, the prize has been awarded by three American politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
To reward Trump, then, would require the Nobel Committee for an ideological full translation.
Fire alarms in the tunnel: Carers behaved like adapters and drove in the wrong direction
Traffic congestion occurred on September 8.
Transport in the tunnel area was interrupted due to the notification both in the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
When it turned out that this was system fault, the fire department tried to make the traffic normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Center said it couldn't be opened because there are drivers on the road with a hat blind, and they drive how it happens, the head-to-head firefighter Pasi Kääriäinen told him at the time of their freshness to the STT.
At that time, the highway was driven even in the wrong direction only after a moment of waiting.
When the first starts to act against the traffic rules, some others often follow, the traffic safety contact manager Tapio Heiskanen confuses.
According to traffic regulations, motor roads and tunnels must not stop as for mandatory reasons.
Transport safety reminds us that in exceptional situations, traffic cannot be compromised by sudden solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always be allowed to travel as barrier as possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the highway is particularly prohibited, as well as making a U-translation and cancelling.
The same prohibitions are also valid in tunnels, in addition to which the driving lights must always be switched on.
Stopping without compelling reason is also prohibited, as is the case with parking.
There have been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to get snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and the time for the operation in question, Heiskan says in the traffic safety statement.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebration even if the ship was caught in the lake base.
The Ilves fans carried by M/S Tampere would have liked to remain on board to continue their victory party, even though the ship had been caught in the lake base, says Juha Syrja, the ship’s leader at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, traveling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, ran off the road late on Saturday night and was stuck in the bottom of Vanajaves Aka.
There were 19 passengers on board and five crew members were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was injured in the men.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue to celebrate on board until morning, but it was certainly more reasonable to send them to the fire station by boat to the port and bus home, Syrja said to the STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the game of Ilves and HPK, which ended in the 4-3 win of Ilves.
According to Syrja, Saturday's buddy was due to the fact that the surface of the water in ancient water was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrja, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest sign was covered with log waste, which is why its reflectors did not normally appear on the dark bridge.
No more mention of a collision
The guy happened on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalme shortly after the ferry route had submerged the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
There was no greater drama in the case, according to Syrja, because the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the event and the impact of the base caused a more marked collision.
According to the Syrja, adherence to the bottom has not caused leaks or pressings on the ship, and the cruises of the ship are normal.
The diver went on Saturday morning to check the ship's proper before the ship was pulled off the carpet.
Because of the certainty, we're still at the shipyard to check that there was no damage, Syrja says.
Syrja believes that the next cruise to M/S Tampere, which was completed next weekend can be handled in an agreed way.
The cruise period of the ship will continue until the date of independence.
No use for ambulances
The rescue facility was alerted on Saturday night a little after midnight.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viila to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for the ambulances.
The day-to-day fireman Matti Willman told me late in the evening that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to darkness and a rather severe wind.
The rescue facility in Pirkanmaa announced half three days after Sunday night that all the crew had been evacuated and passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser built in 1957 has been built in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump’s candidate for judges accused of stumping and drinking may remain unsupervised.
Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court of the United States, may well remain unsolicited for his post, according to Mika Aaltola’s Foreign Policy Institute.
To date, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during their studies.
According to Aaltola, the doubts have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump can end up in office with someone else.
In the United States, at times, there has been a lot of conflicts between the President's candidate for the Supreme Court.
In this case, the judge has usually resigned, says Aaltola.
This is how the President has been able to keep his face.
The name would be a hundred Democrats.
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the election of a new judge has become a politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will probably be taken by Aaltola in the future interim elections of the Congress of Democrats.
It would raise the vote among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge in the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
There is no opportunity to name every presidential period, for judges of the Supreme Court in the United States will be appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of about 70-80.
Some Republicans even hesitate to name
The U.S. Supreme Court judges are normally subject to a background check, says Aaltola.
Even though Trump has only ordered a week deadline for the FBI's further investigation, it can still bring something relevant to Aaltola.
It might bring it.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, it is certain, at least, that the properness of Kavanaugh or the inadequacies of the office will be discussed in a very difficult way before the Senate decides.
Republicans have a majority of 51-49 votes in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators think they are suspicious of the name of Kavanaugh.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the term would be put to the vote and the Republicans would lose.
She recognized Salisbury as a military intelligence agent.
The Russian woman has told the BBC of the Broadcasting Company to recognize Salisbury's poisoning as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
According to the photos, the woman said it was military intelligence with the Anatoli Tshepiga working in GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia said they had previously revealed the other poisonings from suspected men to Chepiga.
Already before, they said they had found evidence that the present personality of men is a cover of personality.
The BBC group traveled to a village near the border of Russia and China, where the Czech Republic grew up.
The woman in the village recognized the pictures published by the young Czechoslovakian Bellingcat.
He recognized the same man from the British police photos of a man who called Ruslan Boshiro today.
Russians are suspected of poisoning the former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter at Novithok in March.
Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded, among other things, by the Russian hero's honour mark in 2014.
Russia is still denying the suspicious GRU connection.
In September, the men suspected of poisoning told Russian TV that they were in an interview in Salisbury as tourists.
Old people in garbage bags in war news
There is now a live example of what the Sote Reform limit, defined by the Sipilä Government, actually means.
My birth municipality’s Vaala’s social services are produced by the Oulunkaari Municipality, a former regional director of Attendo, who has been elected as head of health services in 2016.
The leaders of the municipality warn the delegation of the change limiter.
If the military expenditure is rising now, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The central decision makers of the municipality were scared, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would end the unit of institutional care and small memory hospitals in the health centre.
Home care would be added, which means that long distances in the Vala area, the fact that the elderly in the suburbs of the suburbs are being treated as a health centre by their roots.
Attendo trusted that the municipality would pay its customers.
The Left of the whale did not eat bad preparation, but organised a good public event with many relatives, nearest nurses and also other parties authorized.
I presented the preparation of the Sote County on the sofas of how the Vaala municipality is treated the elderly at home at the moment most in the entire North Ostrobothnia region.
It was also authorised by the neighbouring country, Carina West.
The local newspaper made a big deal about the opportunity, and again it brought the Oulunkaari to its back legs.
Sote manufacturers do not write in any paper that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting for empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
Manufacturers are only talking about the service code, but do not tell us what level of care it receives or what kind of staff structure Attendo will treat the elderly until the harvest.
Without a nurse?
As a result of the absence of a doctor’s night care, the facilities of the health centre will be discontinued.
Attendo will also resort to doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
An example of the whale shows how the central officials rotate the authorized missing data and the authorized points against the back wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the Central Party clears the inhabitants of Vaala, for who will remain safe there to live voluntarily if there is a chance to move away.
Was there a statement from the centre that the whole country is considered to be inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opened the Great Mosque in Cologne
In Germany, thousands of people in Cologne showed their minds when the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened the largest mosque in Europe.
Several hundred people had been gathered on the shore of the Rhine since morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read in the protesters' signs, and was convicted of fascism.
During the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, several demonstrations have been held, and security measures have been tight.
In Cologne, around 10,000 people were expected to protest on Turkey’s human rights situation in advance.
There were also Erdogan supporters near the Great Moskeja.
However, the police had isolated a large area of the Mosque from the environment for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan congratulated the German visit and assessed the relationship between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdoga and Merkel swore on Friday that they would rebuild their relations with countries that have become significantly worse since the Turkish Revolution in 2016.
However, Merkel stressed that there are deep differences between countries, including with regard to human rights issues.
Reviews surrounding the visit
Both Cologne’s Mayor Henriette Reker and the Prime Minister of Nordrhein-Westfalen, Armin Laschet, withdrew their participation in the opening when the review of Erdogan’s visit accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, told me that he had come to a protest against Erdogan in Switzerland.
I want to be a voice to those who cannot go to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, anything different from his own thinking is terrorism.
During the last phase of Erdogan’s German trip to Nordrhein-Westfalen, a significant proportion of the population is Turkish.
Three charges for the murder of a journalist in Slovakia
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the prosecutor told me that three people were accused of the murder of Kuciak and this engaged bead, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them were released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his bride and groom at his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between the politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police have been suspected of murder related to the Kuciaki investigation.
The case and the article published by Kuciaki have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
Karelian distribution may have problems on Sunday in decentralised areas
Due to the error of printing, the Sunday Karjalainen is also required to post as an addressless.
This may be seen in the magazine distribution of decentralized areas where the distribution of shared boxes is required to be carried out from the outside memory.
The situation was the same on Saturday, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Posts put extra leaf bouquets in the county.
Other Finnish subscribers’ magazines are only posted separately on Monday.
The distribution of these magazines is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
The journalist, Mr Nyberg, is interviewing Vesa Heila in his upcoming discussion programme today.
Vesa is in the studio telling about her upcoming space trip, which she already booked by Virgin Galactica in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which was required to pay a bank loan.
If the original plans were true, Vesa would have been in space a while ago.
However, the departure date has been delayed year by year.
Now it seems that after the unlucky test flight, which occurred in 2014, and the death victim, things are in order.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or no later than next year.
The number of Vesa's flight is 300, i.e. his journey is about one year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and the weightless condition is 5 minutes at a height of 100 km, the Finnish astronaut tells about its future home page.
At the same address, he also backgrounds his longing for space.
As a child, I read a comic book called Space Travel and saw Star Trek on television.
Star wars have been seen, and the idea of it was to be able to...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a dull host
Manchester City continued its lossless journey in Valoliiga when it fell on Saturday on its homefield in Brighton's land 2-0.
The sixth victory of the reign of the dominant team is guaranteed by the finish syringes Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to guide the fourth hit of the season to an empty goal, when Leroy Sané found him in the back of Brighton's goal for 30 minutes.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he saw the Brighton defense with Sterling back on the 65th minute.
The Argentinian was able to invest 2-0-ends of punishment easily from the point of the penalty.
With six winnings and one draw, City will lead to Valolioliiga with 19 points in the halls.
However, Liverpool, less than one match, is just a point away.
Liverpool meets on Saturday night in her seventh round in her match with the three of Chelsea.
Youth clubs chose new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Associations elected new decision-makers for their next three years for 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen was elected president from Ylä-Savo and Vice-President Petra Mäkeläinen Häme.
40 members and 40 alternate members were elected, the Finnish Youth Associations will inform on Sunday.
The youth club meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
The Youth Society meeting in Joensuu gives three promises in its three-year action objectives: We keep the doors open to everyone, and we organise equal activities regardless of location and background, and we support volunteering and people on their own path to growth, Finland’s Youth Associations tell us when it comes to information.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and confused Ferrari: \"He's leaving a very important driver.
In the interview with the Britishist of Mersu, the Swiss newspaper Blick asked him to believe that the release of Kimi Räikköse from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the rest of the year.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver to Sebastian Vettti with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago Ferrari told me that Räikkönen would not continue in the garage next season, while Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, doesn’t think Räikkönen would hit gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kim's going to change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional, a fantastic driver.
He stays as one of my favorites and I am convinced that Ferrari loses a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has said that Räikkönen has been one of his first images.
I don't know if Kim knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of the formula one, I played the F1 game at PlayStation for all days.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian competition.
In the race starting at 14 p.m., Mercedes Valtteri Bottas starts.
The evening magazine follows the race at the moment.
Football A-young SM Series Championship became a full farce: only 7 players arrived.
The top level of football boys ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
The starting points for the championship campaign, which began before 13 o’clock, were clear: FC Lahti Academy in practice has a point against the Left IFK.
In order to reverse the situation in the last round, the second in the championship struggle with the Second Ilves must win PK-35 and hope to defeat the Bayans.
However, the Lahti championship was practically confirmed before the start of the game, because the Vasa IFK had only arrived in Lahti with seven players.
If there had been one less, the game could not have been started.
The FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
In the meantime, the Bayans led 7-0.
One reason for the raspberry player roof is that the team has played in part the same players with the A-young SM series, the P20 series and the men's 2nd block C.
The left IKK has played against the fall of the whole season in the second in practice.
On Saturday, in the second round of the final round, Vasa IFK is forced to win the JBK in a guest match and, at the same time, hope that Tampere United will lose its own guest match against KuFua in Toival, Siiljärvi.
The car ended up on the roof in Eno, according to the rescue facility, happiness was involved.
The passenger car ran out of the road and ended up disappearing in Eno on Sunday at 9 a.m.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were mildly injured, the rescue department informed.
Good luck, the news says.
According to the rescue department, the road was wet from the rain.
The police department went to the scene of the accident.
Supo is looking forward to new ways to investigate: hardware procurements and recruitments already carried out, the planned foreign activity is not delayed.
According to Mr. Antti Peltari, the chief of Supo, the intelligence panel has been prepared by making equipment purchases and training staff.
As soon as the Bills entered into force, the budget of the soup should be permanently increased by approximately EUR 10 million.
The office of the Defence Police (supon) on the Helsinki Ratatadu is already preparing a full head for the entry into force of the intelligence authorities.
Supon’s meeting manager Antti Pelttar tells Western Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence.
Serena Williams makes a video in which she sings in top-notch - campaigning for breast cancer awareness
Tennis Superstar Serena Williams will meet again.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video in his Instagram account where he sings only his hands in front of his breasts, says AFP.
The title is The Divinyls' 1991 Hit I Touch Myself.
On the video Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Society.
“I voted for The Divinyls’ global hit to remind women to make regular self-controls, and Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in an area of discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women regardless of the color of the skin in the world.
Early detection is all a and o - it scares a lot of lives.
The second author of the Divinyls song is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, made to honor Chrissy Amphlett.
\"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put his health first,\" Williams said.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was released early on Sunday morning.
In the video comments, Williams is praised for courage.
Williams left Beijing tennis earlier this week.
There is a point in the open tennis scene in the United States three weeks ago.
Williams came to the head of the match and claimed, among other things, that men would be accepted a lot more violently than women’s players.
The Chinese restaurant is not suitable for high-rise people
In addition to traditional Chinese cuisine, the restaurant serves wonderful landscapes.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the province of Zhejiang in China.
It is literally located in a rock language.
If you want to look at the forest below, you can.
Jylhät landscapes at the heights allow restaurant visitors to bark at their lives in the Longquen Mountains.
Getting to the restaurant requires hiking in the middle of the peach trees.
The restaurant opened for visitors on 19 September.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant bathroom is located.
Traveling to the restaurant requires good basic condition, the place is told.
Korpela's alley runs out today: that's how it all ends.
Everything good ends in time.
Today, this is what happens to the domestic country drama of the Korpela valley, which has been quite kept.
The third production season has gone like hot stones: last week, 722,000 Finns were first seen on television.
The top classes themselves no longer have any practical significance, for the Heikki Creative and Jukka Mäkisen series is not going to continue.
During the final period, in relation to the Pacific and Mirku, the idea is again taken forward, and the mother of the Pacific seems to be the first to know what I’m going to consider.
Between Anss and Miisa are also warm, in the light of recent events, very romantic, but then again, there is a thin one.
The police are also suspicious of the man.
However, no one knows how to determine the fate of the ship in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, gets to hear amazing news.
The last will of a long distance will be revealed, which will bring a woman to the brink of tears.
After a week in the Sundays, Sorjonen will continue in the new season.
Today, I'm going to take a turn on TV1 at 21.05.
Do you want to go to work in a small cold tomorrow?
Here are the facts for and against
The Fluns season is hot.
Many people stay home or not.
However, it is worth thinking about whether others should go for the infection, because the disease can be contagious even if their symptoms are minor.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly attack, sometimes they appear in the hips.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your symptoms seem small, says the Prevention publication.
Is it worth staying home?
Prevention said the flu is contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus will take a day before the symptoms start and move forward from five to five days a week.
Children may become infected longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can return to work when coughs are resting and there is no fever anymore, says the professor of medicine Gregory Poland.
Training should also be avoided.
Too fast to return to the hall slows down recovery.
In addition, remember to wash your hands, put them on your nose and throw your towels in the garbage.
You're gonna get sick, though?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not control viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then the fingers won't be put in the nose or mouth, Poland says.
The thoughts are also limited to the mask.
How to avoid infections?
The best way is to still wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
For example, in the United States, average human beings touch their eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Suomi repeats the missionary tradition: “My husband is a ice hockey player.
Ice hockeyer and misses are often combined.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
The 2018 Miss Finnish Crown is home to the dogs of Pertunmaata, Alina Voronkova.
She now lives in Lahti, where she moved when she was 15.
Alina's mother is an Inkerian and her father is Russian.
My father's Russian was bullied at school.
My mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied for my Russian reasons.
In Pertunmaa, I had no friends at all, Alina tells me about the publication of the Miss Suomi semi-finalists.
After high school, Alina decided to start from a clean table and change Lahti to go to high school.
Soon, the missionary found new friends, and the archaeologist left to roll.
At the age of 15, I think I was an adult, but I really wasn’t thinking after that.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Jonas Hurrin, who is familiar with the Pelicans lines.
The ice hockey player has played abroad since his career, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was in the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Championships.
In the early days of a relationship, the couple lived almost a year in a distant relationship, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get to the winning third and that would lead me to a career, I don’t want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even though we would have to live separately, our trust works well, and in the distance, it is the good thing that it is the beginning of the period, Alina stepped up in May.
Continuous growth with joy, death with our kinters
Almost everyone is concerned about the sustainability of the earth.
But we don’t want to give up anything.
Sustainable growth is being sought for sustainable options, but the theory of a reasonable economy also runs into major problems.
During a few generations, economic growth has brought to ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living, before which only dreams could be found.
However, the long-term overcoming of the global capacity and climate change make this market economy's stone chain arbitrarily shrink.

The restaurant ship M/S Tampere hit the bears in St. Petersburg – tightly caught by the rock.
In-water M/S Tampere took the kari on a late Friday night in Aka Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue facility was alerted about the water traffic accident on Friday night after midnight.
The 30-metre ship M/S Tampere is driven to the cartoon, and is firmly attached to its bow with a stone, described by the sun-friend firefighter Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the rescue department, personal injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they're being moved by bus to Tampere, Captain Jari Nieminen told STT at 1 p.m.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viila to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship traveling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had driven off its route to the west of the narrow Jumusensalme.
The police will find out the reason for the events.
The day-to-day fireman Matti Willman told me earlier in the evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult due to darkness and a rather severe wind.
According to the rescue facility, the fate of the ship is unclear.
I don't think the ship's leaking.
After an evacuation operation, the divers will check the situation on the ground.
M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is an inland vessel currently operating as a restaurant ship, with the maximum number of passengers allowed.
The ship also has a private meeting room for private use.
According to the ship’s website, the cruiser has been present in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
A boxer Robert Helenius's evening match against Erkan Teper is shadowing the money gap.
Today, the evening-Sanomat announces the challenge of the boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and the deputy judge Jussi Kokkila, in which he will be charged with a total of EUR 80 000 outstanding manager fees from Helenius with the delay rates.
According to the application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helen on 15 April 2014-30.1.2015.
We've tried to reconcile, but there's no other option.
There has been a clear mandate here, and the work has been done very much, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanom.
The current manager of Helenus Markus Sundman sent the evening magazine in exchange for an account of the events of the boxer’s view.
Helenus denies being obligated to pay the required amount.
According to him, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services financially in a difficult situation and promised to be able to arrange for him games and sponsorships.
It was said that Helenius was obliged to pay only percentages of his matches.
Again, it was assured that Helenius did not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they arrange.
This is also a normal and only practice for professional athletes in manager activities.
It has never been agreed on and would have been absurd in the situation of Helen, Sundman, in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
In addition, from the beginning Helenius would have liked to agree to the distribution of income in writing, but Kokkila and Sundman did not receive the draft until the end of 2014.
He stated that the proposal was bad and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius did not once engage with Kokkila and Helm.
The year after the end of the cooperation, Helen had been shown to be an inseparable but massive reduction in the work of the manager.
This year, the same claims have been raised.
Helenius considers the subsequent activities of Helminen and Kokkila to be degraded, in return.
Helenus meets today at the Erkan Teper's Stuttgart on the 7th IBF Heavy Series Challenge List.
A hearty man and a good journalist
The entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka – Ile – Vainio knew the last radio driver and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
The long-line radio transmitter and supplier Erkki Pälli died at the age of 83 for an incurable liver cancer.
The death announcement was published on Sunday in the Sanomas of Helsinki.
The report reports the death of Päll on September 3.
Pälli reported a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
At that time, the publication also saw Ile Vainio, whose knowledge of the familiar fate died.
On Facebook, he said goodbye as before, Ile Vainio says.
Vainio considers Erkki Päll to be a multi-talented player from which he became a great journalist.
He reminds me that Päll was a kept person with fast hoxots and funny stories.
When I was a little boy, Erkin, when I first went to Finnboard at the age of 12 and started there as a stockman.
Then we met Erki.
He was then a Finnish record informant and in different positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I was going to make albums as a music producer, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Päll was a standard editor in all the parties when he was doing things about artists.
He was always expert and I saw how great the fire he had for comfort, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, she got directly to the skin she interviewed.
He was a hearty man and a good journalist.
For many, he became familiar with the reputable Yle as a radio driver, but he also wrote great journalism.
Erkki interviewed me many times.
He was good to talk to you, Vainio compliments.
Over the decades, Pälli worked in addition to the journalist's work in Fazer's record with Toivo Kärje.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
However, the greatest passion of the day was radio work, where he had a unique style.
He worked radio since the 1960s and became familiar with numerous audiences in Yle's ether.
The day was retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the financial year ended in May showed a profit of about EUR 450 000.
The alliance describes the experienced and full version of its economic situation, although the economy is burdened by the significant debt in the balance sheet.
Mika Kulmala, Managing Director, welcomes rapid response and strict financial discipline.
Last fall, we reacted to the situation as quickly as possible by taking adaptation measures.
The careful planning and economic management of the operation has been hacked through our entire organization, Kulmala says in the newsletter.
We have also managed well in partner procurement, and in addition, world cup returns were the maximum in the past competition period.
However, in the future, cost management must be accurate, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financial models.
I heard my wife scream for help, but then there was silence.
Ten bodies lie in the back yard of the hospital Please, on the island of Sulawes, Indonesia.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been collected for the purpose of assessing the need for injury and treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors due to post-circumstances.
One of the people moving in the hospital was a 52-year-old returnee Baharuddin who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he only uses one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
I spoke to him the last time he was going to school, Baharuddin told AFP.
In the area of the army hospital, Dr. Haris lay, who has suffered injuries to his back and arms.
He was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter at the start of the quake.
The family was invited to a wedding party in Paluu.
I probably had to squeeze under the wall.
I heard my wife scream for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe, told Haris news agency AP, according to the British media.
Small trades are robbed
At an evacuation center, a 35-year-old baby's mother, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm down her hot baby.
He described the atmospheres in the city as passions.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, said Kusuma.
Many of the inhabitants of Please have slept outside or in temporary bamboo rivers.
Even if the house is still standing, any post-conceptions could eventually destroy it and bury its inhabitants.
According to the News Office AP, more than half of the prisoners who were in prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
The prisoners were known to be about 560, so there may be about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners of Donggala prison have also escaped, says The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners became angry and lit the fire of the prison after the guards had banned them from leaving to seek their relatives who were suffering from earthquake and tsunami.
The airport has been re-opened mainly for assistance flights.
Among the first ones, a C-130 aircraft landed in the field, which brought back supplies.
Commercial flights Please allow only limited flights to the airport.
The pilots must land on the ground without the assistance of the air traffic control, for the air traffic control tower was damaged by a bad earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
The whole country spreads across the country on a long rainy night from the west, according to the Finnish Institute of Air Science.
Rain is mostly water, but it is expected to travel or snow in Central and Northern Lapland.
The previous night's kits are not repeated because the temperatures below the cloud cover remain higher.
The darkest night holds the lowest temperatures quite efficiently.
In the west you can visit the packaging side at a moment, said the solar-friendly meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainy area runs eastward as it is morning.
In the south and west there are puddles or half clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures are always moving to the height of Oulu at 10-13 degrees.
The beginning of the week seems similar for the temperatures in southern and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
There are wind and wave warnings in the sea.
Real sympathies are not expected for the next few days, but otherwise there is a typical autumn variation in the weather.
Yes, it's going to be a big start in the autumn, Ilkka said.
Miss Suomi is not seen on television
IL-TV allows you to follow Miss Suomi's red carpet glamour and sparkle.
In IL-TV, IL-TV has direct broadcasts from the red carpet of Miss Suomi.
The broadcast starts at 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday by ten finalists.
The Miss Suomi 2018 final is held in Billnäs in Raasepor.
Before you start the final, you can follow the atmosphere from the top to the IL-TV live broadcast.
The live broadcast starts at 6:30 a.m. and continues for about an hour.
This year, especially the Miss Finland winners of previous years have been invited to the final.
In the jury they will be represented in 1998 by Miss Suomi Jonna Ziprus.
Other representatives of the jury are the welfare entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammuda, CEO of the joint shop Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Légka news producer Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping he could get to the university before he went to the music fairs.
Russian Dimitri's father and mother Svetlana believed their daughter was successful in Miss Suomi.
New Miss Alina Voronkov’s parents Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkov followed their daughter’s first-time crown as proud.
They smoked the public from Pertunmaa and planned to drive back home after the final.
It's a lovely atmosphere!
We believed in Erik all the time, but half an hour before the result began to be exciting, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an inker and Dimitri's Russian.
In the beginning, there is a fluent Russian, even though he has lived throughout his childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than in the career of miss.
It was often said that when she was so pretty that she should be a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio transmitter.
Only later did Alina get excited about beauty competitions.
The parents’ wish was that Alina would get to the university before she participated in the Miss Suomi competition.
This is what happened, and eventually Alina wanted to do a bachelor's degree before she was a missionary.
We asked him why he wasn't involved last year, but he wanted to finish the deck.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because there is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He plays a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be present, it shows.
Alina’s boyfriend, Jonas Hurri, is working in Japan and has not reached Finland to encourage his love in the final.
Alina’s parents believe that the relationship between young people lasts a year.
Yes, that's what I'm going to do!
The parents hoped that the daughter would be able to visit soon.
There has been such a long break in the visit because of the missionaries.
I miss it, even though there are messages.
A young man died in the middle of Lahti, and a police officer caught three people.
Police say three people have been arrested for the incident.
On Saturday, the Hämeen police did not comment on the course of events, nor on the possibility of an over-the-counterness of the investigation.
The police also did not comment on whether the people who were arrested and the man who died in the outage were aware of each other’s entities.
Further information on the case is available at the beginning of next week.
Sari Piippo left his career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - he remembered the idea of a cartoon: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
At the time, the organic bomb began from my husband’s speech, where he suggested it as a person in the story I developed, says the espoola serial photographer, housewife, and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says that he was an EU translator in Brussels for economic and legal matters until after the fourth child became a returnee ten years ago.
I'm really comfortable with my housewife.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to mind what it would do when the little child started to be big.
Then the 2014 photo became a cartoon.
Piippo says he had never dreamed of making a cartoon, even though he had read Aku Ankka, Tint and Asterix on a small scale.
I had recently drawn it as a child, but when these organic manuscripts began to be born then the situation changed.
I first made dozens of manuscripts in the table box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled artist, but I did not get her attracted to it until summer 2016, when I donated Vivi with the help of a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying himself, laughing at Piippo, which tells him that the drawing plate was a great incentive to him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something early.
I didn’t even try to draw the paper, says Piippo to draw his relationship, which he usually does in the evenings.
The script is constantly popping in mind, but I usually don’t do it at once.
One of the three square strips takes up to several hours.
I might make a square at a time and I'd love to play with the colors.
Getting started is always the hardest because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates newspapers from today’s series of pictures, including Scott Adams Dilbert.
As a natural person, the L-teama is a shady carrot-haired mother with salad-haired hair.
Other people are Men, Piss and Twins.
In the world of nature, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from their own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer an obsessive shortage, even though there is an intrusion between the organic atmosphere.
He says he reads his series with his husband and children.
It is such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon that you're drawing and says that I've done this today.
And there are enough challenges for the housewife!

A lot of millions of pot left to shine - these were the real numbers.
There was no fullosom on the round 39/2018.
The biggest winnings of the evening were seen in Lauantai-Joker, which brought 20,000 euros to Vantaa and Vaasa.
Next week, Loton's pot is €3.6 million.
There were two 6 correct results found in Saturday Joker.
Another €20,000 win goes to Vantaa at the S-Market Tikkurila with the Veikkaus Card for the winner.
The other one caught a raspberry online player.
Indonesia's earthquake: The pilot sacrificed himself - did not leave a cracking tower until hundreds of passengers were safe.
Indonesian earthquake hero Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old flight leader.
Agung remained alone in the air traffic control tower until he was able to safely carry hundreds of people to the passenger plane from the affected island of the earthquake.
The young man was in the air traffic control of Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport, which was in the city when the earthquake struck on Friday.
In the other escape from the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his place before he was able to steer the Batik Air passenger plane off the runway to the air.
Thus he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian aviation administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower sank and broke.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping out of the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke, and he got serious internal injuries.
Agung was thanked in a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported to a helicopter for a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the arrival of the helicopter, the aerospace agent told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify the flight, and its strength was eventually measured by 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
Indonesia’s aviation administration has respected Agung’s heroism in social media.
Rehn will consider the end of Europe in the trade war: \"We must look at the following tweet:
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
In all Europe, growth forecasts have been calculated, and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth assessment.
The CEO, Olli Rehn, said in Ylen’s first report that, although the intense tension has no direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn reflects the investment decisions of companies.
The situation also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
Mr Rehn believes that Europe is still well bakery.
It has been able to build a peace of mind with the United States and has also contributed to calming the situation with China and Japan.
Europe does not seem to be cooling to the feet of the trade war.
We need to look at the next tweet and evaluate after that.
We have a rather unpredictable partner in Washington, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest national economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most debt-driven countries in the euro area and the whole Western world.
Yesterday, the Italian government responded very harshly to clearly present a deficit budget on Thursday night.
The deficit for the next year is more than 2.4% of the population.
Rehn considers the situation in Italy to be worrying.
Five per cent of the country’s loan portfolio is problem credit and there is more than 10% of the unorganised credit.
In addition, its public finances are in weak positions and the country seems to be once again beyond its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be possible to paint new crises, Mr Rehn said when asked if Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another thing that challenges Europe is the difference between the UK and the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be in a row.
The difference would be much more negative.
Rehn began as Director General of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), withdraws after a fair year.
The debate on his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen's name have flashed in the speeches.
I don’t think it’s a problem if the Finnish names are included, Rehn said and added that he’s not going to comment on the matter beyond this.
HS’s super-advised Black Box performances will continue again next week - the last tickets to Helsinki will be for sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by the Helsinki Sanomas will continue again in the week that begins.
Other presentations will be seen at the National Theatre on 2nd, 8th and 11th October.
On October 23, the Black Box will be visiting the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets to the National Theatre for sale.
The Tampere show is sold out.
Tickets for sale in Lippu.fi.
Suppliers and photographers on stage during the evening will tell a long story they have prepared, which has not been published in any HS instrument before.
There is something else that no one has ever heard.
“There’s a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, your impressive report on the other side of the earth and talking about a very current health issue,” says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the public has the opportunity to meet the HS suppliers and photographers and to continue the debate.
Helsingin Sanomat has been organizing live journalism for three years.
They have been popular and often sold from the beginning.
More than 15,000 people have already been visited.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier Gala as a year of journalistic action.
Prizers thanked new ways of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
Spring 2019 Black box is seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The show is also available in Tampere and Turku.
At that time, the presentation contains different content than in this autumn evenings.
The missing funguser was found due to an unprecedented experiment.
The Finnish police’s drone skills are the world’s top: “We are asked about trainings.
According to a police officer at the University of Police, the police can use drones in addition to missing searches, for example, in criminal investigations and intelligence tasks.
Oulu's police managed to find a drone that disappeared in Raah on Tuesday in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, head of police college, tweeted on the case and mentioned, among other things, that, through unprecedented experimentation and effective training, we are also at the top of the world.
Drone is a very new punishment, and it's more recent in police duties.
There is no statistics that Finnish police are the master of Drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong idea that this is the case.
This has been clear, for example, when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported at international events.
It is very interesting to see it elsewhere, says Himberg.
It would be hard for visitors to visit the Finnish police’s drone activity.
We are asked for training.
Further generalization
Himberg reminds us that finding the missing person in Finnish winter is very important as soon as possible.
As noted, in the case of Raahen, the lost ones were found with the help of the drone only in a couple of minutes.
The Finnish police have trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are to be trained for more.
Already the drone is being used in police duties a lot, and their use becomes more common and will increase in the future.
That's what I'd dare say, Mr. Himberg says.
In addition to searching for missing persons, according to Himberg, the police can use drones, for example, in an accident or crime scene investigation and in certain types of intelligence tasks.
For example, we already need to check some area a little further away, where there may be fears that violence will be faced there.
Drone can then be used for preliminary intelligence.
Karelian Rugby
Karelian Rugby celebrates the victory of the 2nd Division in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuns were still in the middle of the game with 7-12 losses at the Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second episode they found a plot and whispered to the south guests from 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew that Karelian Rugby had a historic rise to the 1-division.
In the past, the club played in the first place, but at that time the Finnish Rugby series was divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-block 1 division.
The club is going to take the show, but it will know a lot of work next winter.
The current nearly twenty players' roster must be raised to 25.
1-division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer gaming trips, so the purchase of funds must also be in line with it.
Kotkaniemi starts the season in Montreal, strengthens the head coach
The head coach of Montreal Canada playing ice hockey at NHL Claude Julien confirmed the club on a Twitter account that Finnish economist Jesper Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal made a super promise at Kotkaniemi, 18 in the first round with a number of three summer bookings.
The attacker joined Montreal’s training strength from the end of the summer and has presented strong extracts in September exercises.
Kotkaniemi managed to finish the goal at the first time.
Chief coach Julien congratulated the Finnish people on having taken large stages of development to the income camp after their arrival.
The NHL body series begins next week on Thursday night in Finland.
Montreal meets in the opening round Toronto Maple Leafs.
What is a good leader?
This week, a lot has been said about leadership in Finland.
Risto Siilasmaa, chairman of the Nokia Board of Directors, said in an interview with HS, in her book Paranoid Optimist, in which she illuminates leadership of her philosophy.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but the previous Nokia reports have also discussed the inability of managers to act as a team; fear and inability to speak about the crash of mobile business.
The risk-taking capacity and agility of the company's uplifting phase disappeared.
During the week in Helsinki, a giant business event was held in Nordic Business Forum, which led to the Fair Center in Finland.
In addition to Barack Obama, Lavalle rose from 12 business stars.
The word for good leadership was enough.
Gary Hamel, the legend of leadership students, said that a good leader should dare to take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally bound to past decisions.
John Mackey, founder of the Three Foods trading chain, known as the wide-ranging organic selection, said that the manager should be able to communicate with the entire staff the purpose of the company.
And that goal cannot be simply to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, a writer of the Introverts of the Success book, said that the most successful leaders are undergraduately humble.
They act calmly, quietly and determinedly.
They are often introverts.
Aswath Damodara, a financial professor, recalled that the characteristics of a good leader must be hit by one of the steps of the company's life cycle.
At the beginning of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the company’s future is based.
A mature company needs a manager who knows the numbers.
In the Nordic Business Forum, 7 500 visitors listened mainly to Finnish leaders.
They had a threat to information.
A good leader is required a lot.
That’s why leadership goes so often wrong, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They were talking to each other at the scenes.
However, they hardly wonder if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to evaluate.
Sara Chafak arrived on a magnificent red carpet directly from Los Angeles - spends most of his year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the Missifial in a wonderful black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finnish dress also featured a laced patch.
A bit of a pode jet lag.
I'm back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak says.
Chafak says he's going to Los Angeles for experiments.
He's been doing advertising shows, among other things.
In the United States, he describes it as interesting, as well as similar to in Finland.
However, work needs to be done even harder, as the model can always be found in replacements.
You have to dress harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.

The award will be awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group working in the field of live art art.
The Danish police found a large Volvo in the operation: \"We can't tell you where...
The Danish police's extensive searches have produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the bridges of the Jewish Iron and Ison-Belt.
All land and ferry transport from the island of Sjärland was closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
Police are looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS has reached the Chief of Staff of the Copenhagen Police Media Center.
Found the car.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet, Henrik Storm's report to the Copenhagen police will tell East Sanom.
According to Storm, the black Volvo looking for no direct contact with the police.
He said the greatest danger is over.
The Danish extra Bladet told the police on Saturday.
Detective Director Jørgen Bergen Skov was on the run of the Pacific operation.
He didn't want to tell me what the crime name was.
Skov said, \"It's a serious crime.\"
It was a threat to the spirit of people.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
The police won't tell us if they're already caught.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been withdrawn.
The Copenhagen police also followed the events with their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, there is no longer a cause for concern for the general public, as the threat affected certain people.
Macedonia's name has resulted in decades of controversy - now the people vote on it in a controversial election
Macedonia in the Balkans is currently voting on the proposal as a new name for the country.
According to the agreement between the Governments of Macedonia and Greece, the Republic of North Macedonia would be named.
To date, Greece has prevented Macedonia from becoming a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but I ask whether the voter is in favour of the EU and NATO membership of Macedonia by adopting an agreement.
The vote started online at least at a school in the centre of the capital city of Skopje.
A retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted at the school, hoped for support for the agreement.
The referendum will mean change if it opens doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been used in official contacts.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the adoption of the agreement.
The national right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for the referendum to be boycotted.
In addition to the result, it is enough to see whether voting growth will rise by more than 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but yes, the victory of the vote would allow the Mandaat to change the Constitution.
The amendment of the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority of Parliament.
The Greek Parliament must also adopt an agreement.
The voting venues will be closed at two o’clock in Finland.
That's a good win!
Robert Helenius attacked Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius met late on Saturday night at Erkan Teper’s heavy-duty professional boxing match in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finnish man took his 36-year-old German opponent at Waldenbuch, Stuttgart.

Musk has agreed with the U.S. authorities.
At the same time, Musk has imposed a fine of $20 million on his twelfths that he would have ensured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock market.
The U.S. Securities Commission (SEC) has accused Muskia of securities fraud.

Canada fights against time to reach agreement with the United States
Time is threatening the end of negotiations between the United States and Canada on the free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set the limit for Sunday, and the country’s negotiators have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's chief adviser, Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to concentrate on trade negotiations in full.
On behalf of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations around a year ago to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement to Nafta.
At the end of the film, Mexico and the United States reached agreement with each other, but the agreement with Canada has not yet been reached.
The United States and Mexico wish to enter into force before the Mexican presidential elections won Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will enter into office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada’s involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that it is planned to sign an agreement at the end of November - Canada was involved or not.
Due to these timetables, the United States-Canada text should be ready on Sunday so that the U.S. Congress will have sufficient time to evaluate it.

Police captured 11 people after the Honka-HJK match - a wreckage in the field and in the subway station
Police captured 11 people on Saturday after the Honka-HJK football league in Espoo, the crime commissioner Teemu Värtinen of the West Uusima Police Department confirmed the STT.
The reason for attachment was protection from crime and disorder.
The interest was released after the situation was calmed, Värtinen said.
About the interest they told me about the night-to-day.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final misconception, a large number of viewers rushed to the field from the sight reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to push-ups and fist fights between team supporters.
In order to end the situation, there were, among other things, horse police.
In addition to the field, the explosion occurred in the area of the nearby metro station, where some of the arrests occurred.
I wasn’t there, but what I saw in the pictures was so unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the explosion in the field.
According to Värtinen, no criminal reports have been made as a result of the events.
Pöytävi has been embroiled by a butterfly in his SE time in the world cup, Laukkanen also swims to the finals.
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkivi have reached the finals on the day of World Cup 3/7 in the Netherlands.
The races are swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
The HSS's Tablestone was shocked by Finland's record in a 50-metre butterfly shower, where he was the second time of the first time in 22.82.
Previously in September, Pöytävi swims in Helsinki on the trip to SE on 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, a representative of Cetus, was a butterfly 24s at the time of 24.68.

In the beginning of two hundred meters of confusion, Laukkanen was 15 in the 15th time of 2.14,25.
Students play a rare touch: ancient tragedy - a mere Oresteia affects their visuality
Ancient tragedy is rare in Finnish scenery.
For example, the National Theatre has recently seen an ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Philoctes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre High School brought an ancient play trilogy, Aishkylos Oresteia, the only one to be preserved.
In 2015, the Acts open! projects, the Actor School Actors work together with the professional supervisor internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
His international premiere was awarded to Oreste in Berlin in April.
Roiha’s Reconciliation of Orestee is a report on the termination of the blood of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law, a worthy hour for twenty minutes, especially by increasing the proportions of the choir.
The work manages to be very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simon’s great Finnish (2003).
Dramatic lights and theatre pages reveal the presentation highlight the mere and bright scene thought.
Its centre is the dynamics between the performers, the performers, and the performers, who emerge from the choir.
The presentation uses both dual and triangular interpretations of the name roles.
The actors do not leave the scene, so, for example, the Agamemnon, who is returning from the Trojan War, and the murder of Kassandra in this military hall, is shown at the scene, unlike the antiquity strategy of the ancients.
Of course, the performance does not point to being loyal to ancient performance strategy.
In the eyes of the viewer, a modern, authentic interpretation of the text is created, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has succeeded in providing a close group of Master’s in Actors as a group, as an organism, a group of rhythms.
Particularly in choir sections, highly expressive, sculpture-like group formations, actors tend to get their rights bare, only by decorating the white curtain, at the scene.
That's impressive.
The Orestean tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen load
The news begins to appear in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyinda and H2 Energy, Switzerland.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the Hanover IAA Benefit Vehicle Show, Hyundai delivers a thousand car batch novelty models for the use of the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing on the market a fuel-powered truck Hyundai will continue to use the Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models as a reference to the road vehicle manufacturer.
With this quality in the world’s first project, we will take fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by following the development of the tank network, Hyundai Motor’s Vice President In Cheol Lee said in the publication of the contract.
The fists whisked several times in Kajaan
A little over 30-year-old man abused three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaan and represented it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, which resulted in him being removed from the place.
Outside, he would push another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the abuser still hit him.
The police caught the abuser.
At the police station, he continued to act aggressively and kick the other police into his leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to the pub to calm down.
The matter is examined as three assaults and as a violent opposition to the official.
In the middle of Kajaan, there was also another assault on Saturday morning.
The victim was abused by two men.
At first, a 20-year-old Kayan man hit the victim.
A little later, the other man poured him down and the man who hit him was still beating the victim.
The outsiders pulled the abusers away from the victim and called the police.
However, the authors had to leave before the police arrived.
The police will ask the witness to contact the Kajaan police by phone +3585 416 520 or by e-mail at investigation.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Long line radio transmitter Erkki Pälli is dead
Ylen as a long-term journalist, Erkki Pälli died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio transmitter Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of an incurable liver cancer on his Facebook page in March 2018.
This is going to be it.
The doctor also said it, I live on a day at a time, he commented on his situation in the evening paper a month ago.
Safety of trade aunts and sediments must be guaranteed
I was hired for the first time in 1984.
When this year’s rings are surprised by something, it’s usually about big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and, at a time, even a little bit angry.
I also spoke about the case with the Ministry of Services (PAM) working environment expert Erika Kähärä.
He says criminal statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, claim something else.
The police are only aware of the clearly serious cases and many of the right violence situations are not reported.
“The companies have, of course, the obligation to keep statistics close to their situation on the basis of the Labor Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and are not collected anywhere,” he said.
Spiritual injuries do not end up in statistics.
There has always been a problem in violent situations that they do not always cause physical injuries.
However, mental traumas can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between a violent situation and a violent situation is difficult to pull when a certain level of aggressive threat must be counted as violence - even if it is not the case.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, even though the real thing does not happen.
Some areas of residence are restless.
The store has purchased security.
When the opening hours of the stores were released, the time of the media was also great about its impact on the safety of the sellers.
“In the meantime, many employers held security services at least to prevent nighttime emotions and work alone,” Kähärä said.
When nothing happens, a false conclusion is made.
This would seem to have had an effective impact, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When the alarms were well maintained due to security, the perception was born that the guard would be unnecessary.
Now many places are trying to find solutions that could remove expensive security services.
A minor abuse is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that a seller who has been abused does not want to make an appeal for a criminal who usually lives in the vicinity of the trade.
But the same, according to the 2011 law, minor abuse becomes subject to the prosecutor if it occurs at the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time a trade aunt or uncle is being abused, the police should investigate and the prosecutor will blame.
When the court puts a few abusers in prison, and the sentence from there, from the harsh end of the penalty period, the practices would be refined.
A society in which food trade should be open for almost a night in small municipalities must ensure the safety of trade workers.
Heidi Sohlberg tweeted to the Miss before the start of the direct delivery - Sara, Iiro is married then.
Missi’s crowning is not seen this year as a traditional way on TV, but as a broadcast show on Viafree.
The broadcast is hosted by the former Miss Suomi Heidi Sohlberg and Viasat and Viaplay NHL and KHL studios Iiro Harjula.
The backstage and the red carpet are part of Janni Hussi.
Before a direct broadcast, the co-founder informed the invited guests and media representatives about the cost of the shipment.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a fresh hand.
Now all women race!
Take a look at this, Sohlberg cheered up his colleague in the audience.
The first race is followed by many previous years in Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Siepp sat next door and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg would read in front of Sara.
The more probably Sohlberg referred to the newly divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comments, even though it seemed confusing at first.
For the first time, Siepp spoke about his divorce in the late afternoon of the evening.
Missikaunotar said that he did not want to open the reasons for the difference in the public, because it is a matter between him and Roope Salm.
He said he didn’t have a hurry for a new relationship, but he’s going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own things, and especially on my own life, Sara Siepp said.
Harjula’s marriage status came up at a later stage when Sohlberg accidentally erred to call Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula as a parrot.
The three of us laughed at the mess.
Iro was married or how did it go?
Janni Hussi whispered.
The northern man tortured his open mouth by cutting, burning and feeding the mighty sauce.
The District Court of the North has convicted a 34-year-old man who lives in Kokkola for three years in prison.
The crime tool included belt, cable and zippers.
The court condemned these objects to the state.
Rank's accusation was about a violent rape.
However, the District Court rejected this accusation.
Four crimes, gross abuse, forced violence, illegal threats, liberty, gross liberty, and two assaults were considered the cause of the Kokkolainen.
The crimes occurred between 26 March and 24 May last year.
In the end, the man was arrested and captured a few days later.
On Thursday of the week, the Supreme Court of the North gave its judgment and ordered a 34-year-old to remain in the prison of Vaasa.
No evidence of rape
A 34-year-old was also accused of two gross rapes and a violent rape on May 22.
However, these charges were dismissed as unproveable.
The case was dealt with in court behind closed doors.
However, the judge gave a public statement of the judgment.
According to the District Court, the accused had directed to his spouse violence, threats, and sanctions in situations where this had been committed.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, burned with tobacco, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
In his judgment, the court ordered the state to lose the crime equipment: the belt and cable, the bundle ties, the bathtub belt, the knife and the boat.
Four Witnesses
According to the case law, the parties continued to live together between the actions.
It is clear from the judgment that a large part of the most gross acts took place at the end of the criminal period.
Four Witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
A 34-year-old victim should pay a total of EUR 5800 for pain, shine, suffering and temporary harm.
He hardly has that money, for the convicted has already been held debt in tradition.
Prisoner punishment is not the first man.
The newspaper does not mention the convicted name to protect the privacy of the victim.
This is not the case when it comes to writing law.
Europe’s four-point lead Ryder Cup solution
European golf professionals captured their lead on Saturday in a traditional slot game against the United States.
Europe is leading the Ryder Cup to play in Paris at 10-6 when there are still twelve games to play on Sunday.
Europe won three out of four of the four-day four-ball games, and in the afternoon four-game the winnings were equal to 2-2.
European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four pairs of games on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, none of the European couples had reached the same.
On Sunday, two more people strive for history.
No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and no American players like Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
The HJK condemns its supporters in the Honka game of a violent harassment: “The government is not part of football.”
The football betting team HJK released a statement on Sunday in which it condemns the interference of its supporters in the Saturday FC Honka match in Tapola.
“We’re planning events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters,” the statement says.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field, and some seemed to try to challenge Honga’s supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
Organizers were not able to calm down the situation, but police and cavalry were needed.
HJK reports that the team’s players and players are shocked by what happened.
The events after the match are not in accordance with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
“We are strongly disengaged from any action that endangers the safety of the events of the match,” the statement states.
HJK promises to help authorities and event organizers identify safety-threatening factors and eliminate mild phenomena.
The culture of support is part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We all support positive, joyful and encouraging activities in football theatres.
“The power does not belong to it, it is stated in the statement.
A Philippine inventor flies by a drone car - this is how to avoid traffic congestion
Mendola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Pelton.
He now belongs to a growing group of people in the world who swears he invented a flying car or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
Mendola does not believe in mass production of its device.
According to reports from the world, a man has used a large part of his property to build his dream.
He started to fly his car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight - he flew on his device at a height of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope the device raises positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendola said according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL forecast: Work-fighting activities will begin tomorrow in children's day care and social and health services
In public and welfare areas, the bans on overwork and exchanges will be reflected, in particular in social and health services and in the day care of children, JHL’s President, Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be extensive, and they will certainly appear in the way that there are not enough staff available.
Everyone has to think about how they apply for their children.
The employer’s task now is to ensure that the services are played and that no one’s life is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Leminen, the shortage of workers was also seen at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were in overwork and exchange bans due to contractual negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, that the staff has not been hired, but that the workers have been overworked or changed.
This is not a work struggle yet.
It is a standard that every employee is concerned about regular working hours and is only doing them.
JHL opposes the government's intentions to reduce the protection of small businesses.
Markku Jalonen, head of the labour market of municipal workers, does not undertake a preliminary assessment of the effects of overwork and exchange bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very transformative, although services can be weakened.
Employers from all over Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations for what is to be done.
The area is so vast, social and health care activities and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The effects can vary greatly by industry, region and employer, Jalonen said to STT.
Jalonen says that last week experience has already been gained, among other things, from the related activities of the Middle and Basic Nursery Association of Super and the Social and Health Professionals Agency, which lasted three days.
Their effects were rather low.
The ban on overwork and exchange of exchanges between JHL concerns, inter alia, localities, church, state and private social and health workers.
For example, family day care providers are excluded.
At this stage, the fight concerns nearly 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Lame, JHL may take a long time.
The Alliance is also prepared for other work-fighting activities if the preparation of the Withdrawal Act continues.
The government should now admit that here we run into a wall and hard.
Jalose believes that both the Ay movement and the government have to face up to.
It’s special here that the hard ones are already in the barrel, even though the show hasn’t been given yet, Jalone updates.
Great Coralirity is born with the power of children and adults - in the fitness circles of the performance, studying the passion and sea horse gestures
In other areas, the Great Corallirus of the College received its first evening in Hamburg last spring, and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kannelhouse.
Like the previous works of the group, Great Coralirity is a work that is built from the beginning to the end together with the public.
This time, however, a clearer presentation will also be built, which will refresh and thank the observations made in the initial exercises.
There are also hundreds of magic in theatres for child participants.
The child’s point of view has already been included in the preparatory phase of the work.
However, high Coralirity is not a performance for children, but a performance by adults and children in cooperation.
It provides adults with information and observations on the way children take information and make art.
Children’s ability to throw into practice and joint games also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coralirity is similar to some kind of random ballet, fitness circle, and nature-related intelligence, but ultimately it is tuned in different, non-human conditions around the visits.
The great coral reef begins with the familiarization of corals and coral reefs and the business lines of living organisms and fish.
In six different areas of fitness, there are, among other things, the works of the race and the sea horse.
Finally, a less than an hour’s presentation, where music, light and shiny paints and dresses help to explore the life of coral iron.
There are both diving people in the Great Coralirita, who observe the life of coral reef and corals that are considered.
There are also corals looking at organisms.
The views and observations shown in many directions make the presentation dense and life-scratching.
Whether it's the landscape of an organism, the landscape that looks at it, and another organism or landscape that looks at it, and everything at the same time.
For children, it doesn’t seem so difficult.
In other areas, the group aims to practice the boundaries of thinking and action, where access is made up of both children and adults, is challenging.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, Sitrator will have a quiet demonstration on behalf of the endangered corals.
Man’s understanding should not be forced to overthrow, even if it may be difficult to understand the significance of his compassion in front of the visions of destruction.
In other areas, it has built its works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also through political life.
There are other generations, there are different types of consciousness, other species, and future generations, whose wonders and jaws it is a fresh space.
Children grow up too fast - I am happy that my childhood had no smartphones
Today’s children and young people are even more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking tobacco and drinking all the time younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood, and not mess with their lives because of drugs and sex, because others say they do.
I was shocked when my friend told me he had to get his fifth-class sister out of the weekend.
When he came to get his drunk sister, he told me about his sex experiences that night.
I can’t imagine my sister in the same situation because we’ve been told and warned throughout our childhood that we shouldn’t be exposed to drugs and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today's children will be able to live a decent childhood, and they wouldn't need to grow up too early because of the group pressure they create.
I constantly see younger girls in Instagram who are wearing makeup on their face and reveal their clothes on their head.
Snapchatt is used to take and send images that reveal tonight.
It's harder for girls to guess what age they are.
Modern 13-year-olds can easily look 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad my childhood had no smartphones.
I got to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what others think of me.
Yle: The authorities told the government that the case of Airisto Helmi did not involve national security.
According to Ilkka Kanerva, the Defence Police and Defence Forces interviewed Yle were working to inform the Defence and External Affairs Councils earlier this week.
The Finnish Head of State has been told that the Airisto Helme investigation is currently not related to national security, but to organised crime, says Yle.
The information of sources that were anonymous was confirmed by Ilkka Kanerva (kok), chairman of the Defence Committee Yle.
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Defence Police went to the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily economic crime.
They were very strict that they did not speculate that there would be other, Kanerva commented on Yle’s interview.
According to Ylen data, there has been no evidence of a connection to national security so far, but the investigation is still ongoing.
We cannot yet know what can be revealed from there, says one of Yle’s interviewers.
A week ago, extensive domestic searches in Turku and the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is a mere economic offence or a threat to the internal security of Finland.
This week, the evening magazine made up a case in which there are claims both for and against.
Video: Dream paint saved Liverpool's lost series
Liverpool’s 100 percent Valeoliiga’s start came to an end, but it was still more satisfied with the team’s 1-1 match on Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran to 1-0.
Then the combination of Pep Guardiola sent the entire Valolioliga signal that City was serious now.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And surely the Liverpool Manager Jürgen Kloppi arrived with the same idea in West London.
The Reds had started with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool began stronger, and in particular the Virgin van Dijk seemed to rule alone at its own end of the field.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a Wednesday fine league from Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard rose from the exchange bench to solve the match with a wonderful individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved from the very beginning.
At 25 minutes, he first balled in a small space with three-arm Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
In the end, the croat saw the Hazard rushing forward and sent it a fully weighted diameter.
Hazard was a bit on the edge of the penalty zone, but he bombarded a full left leg in the back corner of the bet.
Pool's brass officer, Alisson, was a little slow in his fight and didn't get his finger on the ball.
The club certainly felt the defeat position lightly unfair because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger dropped the target line of Mo Salah's direction.
In the second period, the Chelsea Vessier Kepa got into the real thing.
The Baskivah reacted quickly to the Salio Manén bet and pushed the ball from the tortoise to the corner.
On the other hand, Alisson was zeroing his drive through Hazard.
The best place for guests came in 72 minutes when James Milner found his focus on Bobby Firmino.
However, the Brass Star suit was directed towards the teammate David Luiz, who saved the host's command.
It didn’t last until 89 minutes when the exchanger Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot at 25 metres.
Sturridge played with his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it in honor of his inviolable bet on the upper corner.
Liverpool’s 100 percent league initiative came to an end with a 1-1 game, but it’s still too far ahead of you, along with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the championship with two points behind the top.
In the clock transfer discussion, the poters are deep
I remember a decade ago when a magazine asked various Finnish influences, which divides the Finnish people.
The only answer to Juice Leskisen was the Nen ending.
Some people have their last name, and some don't.
Jakolinjoja can be born anywhere, and here was one serving.
In the EU, Finland has made it possible to give up the annual shift.
A lot of people agree that two times a year has been a fool's job and caused a wide range of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The hardest thing to do now is to figure out what time the clock will end: the current summer or winter season or another time zone.
This also allows the people to express their opinion on the Otatkana.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open on Friday 12 October.
The debate is going to be a good thing in coffee tables and social media, and everyone has a say.
Winter time is defended by the influence of the morning light on people’s well-being and summer time by the influence of the evening light on people’s desire for outdoors and their well-being.
Both sides have strong supporters and good reasons.
According to research, the morning light rhythms the day of the human being and gives comfort.
On the other hand, if not particularly suffering from awakening in the dark, the light will increase the movement of people outside and give more opportunities for autumns, for example.
The amount of additional light after the normal working day has already been calculated to an hour.
I would prefer to take both of them, but bad for us to sit in the northern corner of the earth, we can't do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many anyway.
A typical discussion on the subject is that your own view is driven and the view of the other is very strongly opposed.
The argument of the opposite is not very much to listen to, because the most important thing is how it feels about itself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion about it, it is somewhat unnecessary to try to turn the other’s head.
It burns the square to waste.
The subject is an extremely easy debate, because it does not require a big effort and a mutu feeling as a justification.
In general, similar types of things are disputed more sharply and equally infertility.
It's a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but it's not the same.
And it always offers an appropriate scapegoat if life feels so bad.
Josba fought for a guest win
Josba’s first guest game in Salibandy Divar produced the perfect three serial points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went home from the Seinajoki to the joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory with him.
Nurmo was still painting at the beginning of the third round, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In the time of 50.47 the brothers Eedu and Juoso Lehtiniemi plotd a 6-5-powerless wall.
In the ice creams of both teams, decisive minutes were played on the level.
Josba’s most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The 2nd chain was also fire-powered when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonenkin (+0) played his goal at the time of birth also in the second chain.
After three series, Josbal has six points.
Next, O2-Jyväskylä will be visiting in two weeks.
Eno Church on Sunday 200th anniversary
The Eno Church’s 200th anniversary will be held on Sunday partly in a very sad atmosphere.
The burning of the church of the mountainous savaara a week ago was a shock.
The church of Eno was guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is the place of the celebration.
Although no one would like to do so, the Church of Eno is now the oldest church of the Joensuu Church.
The church in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the municipal and other alliances in the world.
The family fair begins at Eno Church today at 10:00 a.m.
Then we move to the church house next to the cattle table.
The program has everything inside and out all day.
For example, the church building can be seen with the guidance of Ari Räsäne, who retired 37 years as a church master.
The birth feast of the church also means the end of one era.
The already removed church house built in 1982 will keep its doors open for the last time today.
We are now in the outskirts of the former county house, says Kappaist Markku Koistinen.
The church house destroyed internal air problems, but the church has been standing healthy for 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns from Tesla's speech to the head of the government - Petros' accusations were agreed with $40 million
Tesla and Elon Musk, CEO of the company, have agreed with the SEC of the U.S. Securities Market Supervisory Authority.
SEC suspected Musk was guilty of fraud, and Musk was in danger of being left behind by the company he founded.
However, Musk can continue as Tesla's CEO.
Instead, Musk will have to resign from the seat of Tesla's Board of Directors for three years.
The company will have to hire the president of the external government.
Musk is also subject to tighter supervision.
According to the agreement, Tesla needs to hire two independent managers and monitor Musk's communication more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk pay both $20 million (around 17 million) to settle the case.
“It is intended to prevent new market failures and the disadvantages caused by Tesla’s shareholders,” says Steven Peikki SEC, Director.
The case started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company’s financing was secured.
The TV temporarily raised Tesla's stock exchange.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of fraud.
According to the Agency, television was false and misleading and Musk had not spoken with other directors or potential donors of the company.
In practice, the agency accused Muskia of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that it was suing the company and Musk.
The SEC claimed that Musk would be convicted of fines and refused to act in the management of the stock exchange companies.
The SEC’s challenge was to scare investors, and Tesla’s share went into a strong fall.
More than 800 people died in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis
In the Indonesian earthquake and following tsunamis, the number of deaths has risen to at least 832, according to the AFP news agency.
The number of deaths is expected to continue to grow, as the destruction is still ongoing.
According to Vice President Yusuf Kallan, the final figure may rise to thousands.
The historic earthquake raised the tsunami, which attacked the city of Sulawes on the island of Sulawes.
A warning was given immediately after the quake, but was quickly canceled.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are at least from Palus.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the area in Donggala, which is close to the centre of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to have died.
Requests for assistance
The Indonesian Army has been alerted to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widododo, who arrived in the extermination zone today, urged soldiers to continue their rescues without losing sun and night.
One of the main points of the rescue is the hotel in Palu, which is thought to be 50-60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, Head of the Finnish Agency for Rescue, said that one of the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel’s most popular business travelers was made alive at night.
We also heard people's requests for help, he told us.
According to Syaug, the quake and tsunami area would quickly be used to dig heavy-duty equipment.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their loved ones.
Help me, you in the fire and in the vicinity.
My friend’s family members are still missing, one writer appealed to the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of disruptors in the UK
Many British politicians were subject to harassment when their contact information leaked due to the shortcomings of the app's encryption.
Among other things, the bullies got to the minister's phone numbers.
This was the application used by the British Conservative Party in the Government.
For example, the Minister of Environment, Nutrition and Rural Affairs Michael Gove, and the former Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson, were subject to harassment.
A number of MPs have received alarming calls.
Due to the lack of encryption of the application, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians that were a conservative party in the mobile app of the annual meeting.
The public was able to access profiles using a political e-mail address, which was easily available online.
You can view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson as a profile picture of porn and title for a moment.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed to mediamogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian's columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows for the login of other people's profiles with these e-mail addresses.
Then the loginer can view the contact details of the profile person and, for example, send messages in this name.
The meeting application made each supplier, politician and participant in the telephone number of the public, Foster appreciated.
The Conservative Party spokesman apologized for the data leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application is now safe.
The British Information Authority (ICO) supported the data leak.
The application was developed by Australian Crown Comms.
The Labour Party in the opposition criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Suomi audience has a large number of Polish populous visitors every week.
The exact viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Suomi.
The Wall, a rapidly spread American format in the world, landed on the English version of Nelos on Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen is described in the same studio in Poland, where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the possibility of photography was exceptional, as the size of the format was 12 meters high in the playing wall required space.
During the initial period, the social media highlighted the programme’s studio audience, which was cast into Polish.
On Twitter, there would be a debate on whether the Polish people in the studio might understand anything about the game to be played in Finnish.
Unne Ringune, head of the National Programmes of Four, illuminates the issue to the Evening Journal.
He says that the studio audience has close to players, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as Polish viewers.
The public consists of international killers in Finnish production, just like the generals of the The Wall periods described in other countries in the same production mode.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, which go through the descriptions of different programs, the ring background.
He reminds me that following the game itself is not so obvious, even if he did not understand the language to play it.
Red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to separate.
However, there are interpreters in the guest-language studio that handle the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret the events throughout the studio as a simultane interpreter.
And the studio director then instructs the public and tells them what kind of plugs are being thrown there, and what's going on,\" the Ringunen says.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff and David Hasselhoff worked in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was a few years ago involved in Talent Finland's descriptions of us in Finland.
He always had a simultane interpretation of the ear, and he knew everything he was talking about in Finnish, the sum of the ring.
Japan’s South-South brawl typhoon is moving towards the capital – the authorities warn us of the earthquakes and floods
The authorities also warn of potential land strikes and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Taifune Tram, but according to the authorities, major injuries have been avoided and so far there is no information about the deaths.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so hard that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK general radio company, people have been evacuated to shelters, and more than 300,000 households have lost electricity.
Over a thousand flights have been cancelled, and the bullets are in place because of the storm.
The storm is expected to hit Osaka half a day near the time of Finland.
The capital of Tokyo is not directly on the storm's route, but there are also heavy winds and rains.
Trains have been canceled today in Tokyo.
According to weather scientists, Trami tortures Japan until Monday.
The Sky of the Aces
The beginning of the music has been bad.
The sky was darkening almost as long as the team lost its 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) on Saturday, in its homefield, to Vaasa Sport.
The porridges now have five successive losses, and there are two points in total from six rounds.
No player or two lower chain players have yet made a goal.
The hair also grows all the time.
Against the sport, the audience will smell as far as you can when the game was almost half left.
Six games are only played and, of course, there is no reason to give up.
We have to be careful, because that is how weak we played.
In particular, the second batch was a shame, and the Ässi’s power 1+2 did Jarno Kärki.
Of course, the sport won.
The team had a game on Friday, so it would have been thought to be visible.
Maybe it did, but the Aces didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors to the day of the bread continued to increase
Pirkko Härinen, the mother of the bread day, wonders the audience of the event at the big hall.
In some ways, he thought that maybe this year he wouldn’t be so much of a crowd, and he’s thinking about it in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017 the SM competitions were held at the same time as the Bread Day, so perhaps the expectations would make it possible for the audience to decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, it was different; the corridors were already rescinded just before ten, the sellers told the end of the products, the news pores were sold more than 500 doses before, and even in the number of cars, the Hearer heard that there was an increase.
An estimate of the number of visitors has been around 6000, says Jõrinen later in the afternoon.
In the morning and afternoon five hours, there was a lot of program for families with children, which may have attracted them to a record list.
He also estimates that the event will get even further.
The sellers also map the Liper every year from a larger area.
This year, presenters, handicrafts, pastries and harvesters had reached the baker almost 100.
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Härinen, was looking for the audience from the hall’s viewing room.
In the beginning of the day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the audience's vote.
11 different types of bread arrived at the children’s bread competition.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, the winner of the roulette competition, spent the day in a handful of marts.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - from this you recognize a good lamp
Wake up the space to life, create the right atmosphere for decoration and read the book without feeling tired.
Good lighting is worth raining.
We had three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips gave Innolux sales and marketing director Tarja Jokinniemi.
Make a service to your eyes
The importance of lighting increases, the more years of age are behind.
Sufficient light can help with problems that many come with age when the accuracy of the vision decreases and more and more people suffer from dazzling.
The need for light also increases.
The six-year-old needs a light three times more than a 20-year-old.
Therefore, it is worth raining for health reasons.
Good light will give you enough light, but not dazzling, Jokiniem's hint.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior is only available with the right lighting solutions.
The designer of this moment has the opportunity to choose.
The popularity includes an elegant, Scandinavian and Japanese-related japandi style.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retrotyl, with its strong colors, different shades of metal or ice cream, has grown up to the boom.
Reality is fascinating in the same way as home in other interiors.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Show your personality
On the other hand, home is now invested more than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, they want their own home to be customized, even brave whales with a story to tell.
People are looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design-conscious,\" says Jokiniemi.
Home is not necessarily the latest trend light, but the timeless classic for which it has been saved for many years.
Certain timeless, decorative and elegant classics keep their surface from year to year,” says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and see you!
KoKoo showed the door to the Canadian player after three games
The roads of Koo and the attacker Brendan O'Donnel are breaking down.
The Canadian leader played a total of three League games without any power points in the orange music, KoKoo says when he announced.
O'Donnell moved to Kokoho in August with a one-year contract, which included a trial period by the end of September.
In the last year, the 26-year-old attacker played KHL in Kunlund Red Star's lines and KHL farm at the VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
O'Donnel's new company is not yet known.
The player wants to show an example of recycling - the goods go to the world in recycling boxes, the plastic changed into paper.
The game specialist currently recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of stone footwear shop customers are no longer packaged in plastic bags, but in paper bags made from recycled materials.
Products ordered from the online store are packaged for example in packages from importers.
All our packages will be reusable.
We may use boxes for a dozen times, as long as the package is in order to be able to use it, Ville Puurula of Oulu's Game Man says.
As a soft material, the company uses newspapers and other similar recycling materials as a rule.
The plastic can be avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we will have to move to recycling material in the envelope.
The movement wants to set an example for others too.
Recycling is not an additional effort, according to Puurula.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is used again.
In addition to new products, the main product range of the movement includes, among other things, the games and equipment used.
Every fashion-conscious purchase: One and the same shirt works in which you live
Classic clothes work from the season in a different outfit than in a suit.
They create the basis for a good wardrobe with their multi-use, as it is easy to build different outfits around high-quality classics.
In the autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality needles.
This category also includes a black Pole.
A black needle made of natural materials with a half-accumulation cannot be a false supply.
The clothing can be connected to both direct pants, warts, and jeans, and can be built around it in both a controlled housing and a dirty style.
Pooloneu is suitable for both a young modern dresser and a classic sophisticated style artist.
This is how you create a style.
The autumn trend block is made of golden brown and wide-sleeved flat-sleeves, black semioneules and gray ankles.
Classic Poole together with other classics, blue-green scooters and wine-red permits, makes up a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring it to the black hemisphere by combining it with trendy clothes: jeans, high boots and thick stockings.
Young and stylish!
Russian intelligence services have a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation’s foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet Union, sabotage activities were specialized in so-called DRG groups.
The name comes from the Russian-speaking words of the diversionno-razvedivallja group: sabotage and intelligence group.
The officials of the Soviet Security Service in the western countries of the KGB prepare detailed plans for important sabotage sites, says Vasili Mitroh (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
These included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired uniforms and accessories for the DRG groups for cover operations of Bundeswehr, railways, hijackers and certain factors.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riots, set up inspection stations for leaders in Ukraine and separated Crimea from their motherland.
The agents of the Cold War were hiding accessories for sabotage groups with mines, explosions, ignitions, and media devices.
In 1998, the KGB's secret was found in Switzerland, which was bombarded by the authorities sprayed it with water guns.
Police arrived at night for four bikes in the county.
The police got caught in North Karelia on Friday and Saturday night.

On the ground side, the car was leaked four nights, and the 19-year-old local man in the car was blown up by the police as 1.54 promilles.
He didn't get serious injuries in the outskirts.
In the centre of Outokummu, a 20-year-old foreign-state man driven a passenger car blew the alchemy at 1.33 promils.
The police suspect these men's drivers of a gross bike drink and the driver of Polvijärvi, in addition to the risk of road safety.
On Saturday morning in Tuupovaara, a 36-year-old man who carried a local van at the crossing of the Gulf and Hoikatie, blew 0.52 as a promille.
He's suspected of being drunk.
The police are asking for observations at the Turku Railway Station after midnight.
The police said the man was abused at the parking lot in front of the station with the most deadly consequences.
It was recorded on the surveillance camera.

HPK keeps Riska in line for the rest of the season, the magazine's trial time is over
Mika Toivola, the sports director of Hämeenlinna, says that Filip Riska (central) has been important to the team in initiatives, underpower play and in the defensive role of the Square.
In the early autumn of the experiment, Filip Risk will continue in Hämeenlinna HPK for the rest of the season.
Experienced Riska, 33, success in the roles offered to him confirmed the leadership.
Filip has been an important piece for us in initiatives, subpower play, and the role of the four-field defender.
Even though there is still something to improve, it is good for the young team to stick to such an experienced player, the HPK sports director Mika Toivola commented on the company’s announcement.
According to Hopela, the value of Riska rises when playing ice hockey League solution games.
The central shocker from Pietarsaari Riska has previously played too fast in JYP, Luko, and Sport.
Oskar Lehtinen, the co-founder, was left without a contract after the trial.
The real story today on TV: The climber was left to die twice.
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on man’s own experiences.
The movie is based on it.
Everest now gets his first night on the Finnish TV.
In May 1996, the devastating snow storm surprised the climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormakur’s 2015 guidance describes the survival report, which has been processed from cereals.
Tragedy has been made of films and documents before.
There are also real events in this case.
The highest mountain in the world took eight climbers' lives 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced leaders of excursions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who served as the Reader of Weathers.
Weathers' life could have saved the eye surgery before he left Nepal.
As a result of this and the pressure of the air, he lost his vision, which is why he had to skip the peak.
Rob Hall continued his journey and never returned again.
However, Weathers’ struggle for life and death had only begun.
As the storm went up, he was lost and was no longer found in the camp.
When a man came to find him, he was found in such a bad condition that he was not believed to survive.
Weathers were left to die.
It's like he still got on his feet and found the rest.
Weathers was thought to be dying, and again he was left behind in his own happiness.
It is clear that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, the fellow climbers also began to believe in the possibility that they were given help.
In the film Beck Weathers, she plays Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today, the 200-year-old Eno Church
Enon’s 200-year-old church has been celebrated today at church.
The church was celebrated on October 4, 1818, and the whole family celebration was prepared for Sunday.
The party began at the Eno church fair at 10 a.m. at the family fair, after which, there has been an antimale at Eno’s church house.
The church was full.
The family fair was attended by 517 people.
Eno’s church lord, Armi Rautavuorii, was glad that people had come to church so much.
It is a great pleasure for a long time and gives strength to work, Rautavuori (pictured) says.
The fire of the Church of Kiihtlysvaara has touched many, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Church of Eno.
The Church of Eno is now the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran churches in Joensuu, after the destruction of the Church of Kiivutysvaara in the fire.
The wood church in Kiivulysvaara was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a charter was held, where the church was silenced and remembered in the fire.
Pictures and videos: Medican flashed its power in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
The powerful hurricane-type symphyrchsky went on Saturday from lunch to Greece.
The Mediterranean hurricane is called Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has given a red weather warning to the regions of Attika, Peloponnes, Joonian Islands, Kyclades and Crete.
In the pictures taken from the area, there are plenty of floods around Greece.
The video published on Twitter shows how the river has suddenly appeared in the area of Korinthia, between the houses of Kiato, instead of the street because of floods.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by flood water.
In the southern part of Peloponnesus, heavy wind caused a strong sea trip.
The Finnish Embassy of Athens instructs people on Facebook to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The mission calls for the monitoring of weather information and guidelines from local authorities.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, brings heavy rainfalls and even flooding.
According to a study published in 2011, the media only appear once or twice a year in the entire world, typically on the roads of September-October, when the temperature of the sea is still high.
Now the blowing storm left its floods in Tunisia and Libya before its journey towards northern and Europe.
There are also refugee camps in Greece, such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
The storm is also under fire in the summer in the area of Athens.
In Greece, the medician also ran out last November.
Not to go to the sea now, but flights are still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on holiday in the island of Greece threatened by the sym storm.
The trips to the sea are cancelled and it is important to be careful that no branches or other bulk is flown on top of the storm.
Such instructions have been provided by guiders to the fair 3 500 in Greece for a holiday Finnish weekend through the sunnuts.
The instructions come to the need, because even the Zorbas storm that reaches the terror readings has been predicted to stretch the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, wind speed can rise in the cage up to 45 metres per second.
The harsh rains that increase the violence of the weather.
All passengers from Finland who have notified their telephone number through the Sunmats and Tui have been warned of the severe wind by SMS.
In the air, however, sun and heat
According to Inka Ikonen, the sunmater communication expert, by Saturday evening in the resorts, has been avoided from the worst.
For example, flights have fallen and have risen according to the normal schedule.
We will follow the situation all the time.
We'll go ahead of security.
I was supported by media officer Antonia Schroderus, who said that their flights have also flown on schedule.
We are constantly in contact with our staff.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me about the first night on Saturday.
In the most popular Greek islands, i.e. Rhodes and Crete, there are currently a total of 1,500 Finnish travellers.
In addition, a few hundred travelers travel in smaller places.
For example, the worst storm in Kos Island will arrive on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rhodes had also mocked the sun, and the temperature fell to 27 degrees, according to the Icon of the Sunshines.
Zorbasen has been estimated to be moving to the next Turkish series, although slightly relaxed.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and have checked the number of Finns flying to Antalya Tuilla, for example, according to Schroderus.
Shirly Karvilla and Janni Huss have perfectly identical evening dresses in the Missile - this is how they respond to the situation
The media personality and fitness beauty star Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Suomi final on Saturday in an open evening dress.
Hussi says he bought a dress from Meslew.
I went out and decided to trust the professionals who found me a wonderful dress for this evening, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress had also been chosen by the runner Shirly Karvinen.
The two themselves also saw the same outfit and looked at the situation laughing.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanom that he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to put himself on the plane.
The Hussi works as a backstage and red cappet driver in the Missile, and he talks about the stars that arrive at the scene.
Huss has a fresh move behind, because he moved from Kamp to Jätkasaari on Friday.
I'm going to stay there for now, see what's going on.
It is essential that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi thinks.
Before moving, Hussi took a vacation alone in Greece.
It was great, I was only at the hotel for a week without leaving.
When stress broke down, I got a flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvise's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention - collecting curious views of pensioners
The runner and the 2016 Miss Suomi Shirly Karvinen told Miss Suomi on a red carpet that she had enough to do with radio traffic and Love Island in Finland.
Even to the extent that Karvinen arrived at the final directly from Finnair.
I makeupd and put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
At home with the change of the evening dress, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says he pulled out his makeup in the middle of the pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of travelers.
I had a big mirror, and I saw a mirror of people's eyes.
My makeup was fun at least for others.
Hairy flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his nest as a fan of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience as stopping so far.
Karvinen says he went to the show's singles on Friday.
It's really raw in some way.
They are real feelings of people, Karvinen describes the feelings of the program’s singles.
How do I get overfly boots?
Three perfect examples
Classic clothes are clothing pieces that work in a different outfit than in a dress.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes they fit even the most modern individuals.
A few years ago, the over-family boots that have been raised into the hit of the autumn and winter season have not gone away.
In accordance with its name, the boots on the knee are repeated in style from year to year and sesong to year.
They seem to share user opinions, but it is worth trying out a bold model, well - bravely.
In fact, the Upper Pole boots are suitable for any collection of apartments.
Whether it's brown, lace, boring or twig, the symplar of the boots of leather or artificial leather works.
The long boots look good in both the feasts and the archaeologists.
Black over-polven boots are also very suitable for hempegic outfit collections.
They adequately balance the feminineness of a pink, flowery blouse and a hempy, soft needle.
A fresh but autumn style of everyday life with a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-henk outfit is produced from a long copper-brown sage, over-the-generation caps, visible earrings, and a rivet bag.
Although there is a certain degree of luxury in the upper generation boots, they are also perfect for relaxing everyday life together with the t-shirt, long shorts and trendy slippers.
It's so easy and stylish!
Two robot cars start to operate in Espoo
They have been operating for the rest of the year and take passengers on board, the city of Espoo informs.
Attaniemi’s robotic cars play a role in the role of the bus simulator, as the next spring in the region will be launched by robotic buses.
The project develops and pilots robotic vehicle traffic throughout the year and tests the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
In the experiment, you will find out how robotic cars are doing on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robotic bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, Transport Manager.
For the first time, robotic cars will automatically pass across other traffic without special transport arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of a passenger sitting in a ride.
Vehicles have been able to sense their environment all the time on a number of different sensors and assess whether the vehicle is free.
If this is not the case, they will interpret whether there is an obstacle to the vehicle, the bicycle or, for example, snow rail, according to the CEO of the Sensible 4 for the development of robot traffic, Harri Santamala.
The robotic cars travel throughout the autumn on three days a week: Tuesdays 13-15.30, Wednesdays 10-15 and Thursdays 10-15.
The robotic cars stop by six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
The stops of the robotic cars identify the stops of the parking lot.
Most likely, the number 1 is available from the parking lot on the Otakar.

Police are monitoring hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Police Department of Eastern Finland conducted hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with the Forest Board and the Finnish Riding Centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, police officers told the social media on Saturday.
The main focus of control was hunting in law and authority.
A hunting card was checked for each hunter and a hunting permit required by the state's countries.
In addition, the possession permits for hunting weapons and the permitted quantities of cartridge used for self-charging weapons were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the inspection, and only one hunter was found missing a hunting permit.
The hunter was assigned 12 days of unlicensed request.
In addition, the police blew 133 vehicle drivers, and two of them were suspected of riding a bike.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic violations in the fine procedure, a police procedure.
In conclusion, hunters follow the hunting permit very well.
Many hunters were surprised by surveillance.
One hunter said that “I’ve been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the permits.”
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting control in the autumn with other supervisory authorities.
Mystinen goes to Turkey to follow the choice of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of Interior Kai Mykkänen (kok.) will travel to Turkey in the near future to follow the choice of future quota refugees to Finland.
Finland has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps this year.
Elections are usually made a couple of times a year, involving representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the Police.
The delegation is already in Turkey for interviews.
The UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR) will first elect people in a particularly vulnerable position.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to have a particularly painful position in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled people and sick people, women and children.
In Finland, more people are chosen than there is in the quota, because in practice part of the group is not available for different reasons.
It is also the way in which the Turkish Minister of Internal Affairs, Syleyman Soylu and Syrian NGOs operate on the border.
The trip is also accompanied by Ilkka Salmi, the Ministry of the Interior.
Talking about lifting the quota
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, there have been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1 050 a year for a couple of years, but since then there was no agreement to raise it.
The meeting has supported the increase in the quota, but the project has recently fallen into its blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally) recently presented a gradual increase in the quota to 1 500-2 000 people per year.
Mystical visit to this government is the first time that the Minister of Internal Affairs will take place to follow the choice of the quota refugees.
Former Interior Ministers Petteri Orpo (Kok.) and Paula Risik (Kok.) were able to move to their new tasks before the visits were organized.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 from the EU per refugee in a particularly vulnerable position.
Now we go to the hacks - no longer knows whether to cry or laugh
Last Saturday, Karjalainen announced a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article found that the bill initially prohibits the holding of all animals that are not separately authorised by the Ministry's regulations in relation to production animals, pets or other business activities.
All other animals are, in principle, prohibited except those mentioned separately in the Regulation.
If the bill ends in law, it would mean that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law expressly prohibits action that endangers the security of society or the good manner of society.
It is now, in principle, to provide for the prohibition of all activities in which the law or regulation does not expressly authorise.
The change causes nothing new to try, for example, in business activities and do nothing else before the law or regulation which has been adopted.
The government’s activities in lawmaking have generally been weak.
Now, if we go to the road that, in principle, everything is prohibited in Finland, which is not allowed separately, we will no longer know whether or not to cry or laugh.
I don't doubt that the Animal Protection Act would require an update.
But this is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but it is likely to accept such - everything is prohibited, which is not permitted by law or regulation separately.
I hope there is a reasonable minister who will interrupt the progress of such a legislative project.

Kimi Räikkönen
Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen admitted that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard in the times of the Russian Gp.
However, there is no reason to sink into panic in the Ferrari camp, an experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than we were, but it's not a big deal.
Our car was the best in time for the weekend, but they were just too fast, the fourth drive, and their roommate Sebastian Vettel, clearly left of Mercedes, said Räikkönen.
Ferrari was already in the last race in Singapore.
I was asked what the same fall from Mercedes' rides was due.
They seem to go faster than us - so simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably go at the same speed as they did.
I don’t know anything more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
During the time hours, rare touch was seen with regard to the upcoming Tale of Räikkönen Saber.
Charles Leclerc was the seventh in the first season of the Räikkönen, and Marcus Ericsson was the last time.
For Swedish driver, the 10th departure is the best for more than three years.
And even though in the second driver's session five drivers left completely unmanned, the final result was a taste for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging Räikkös in the light of the future?
Yes, if you compare where they were from the beginning, then the step forward has been big.
There's a different story next year, so let's see.
It was in it – Robert Helenius struck Erkan Teper: “Robbe is back.”
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper's match at Stuttgart's evening took me on a flat mark.
The German was a more initiativeal party in the ring, but he didn’t get a good hit.
Obviously, Helenius controlled the match with his hard series, who found it very well.
Finnish was also clearly better in physical condition than Teper.
Finally, the solution came in the eighth round, when Helen struck Teper on the left.
The osuma was so hard that the cognac in front of the home audience did not even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius was quite moderately windy.
In a field interview, he initially praised the good mood and opponents created by the public.
Then he changed his tongue to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish instructors.
We took the belt today.
Helen was happy right after the match.
It was a huge victory for Helen's career.
It might even be possible to get to the World Cup, Helen said to the West before the game.
Instead, the fight could have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's been in mind.
There is no younger one here, Helenius, 34 years old, admitted before the Teper attack.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster can be multiplied
According to The Guardian, the Vice President of the country calls for a clear rise in the number of victims.
According to Vice-President Yusuf Kalla, the total number of victims can rise to thousands.
Severe conditions
The rescuers are looking for trapped remains, as well as the dead from the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: Please, from the port city and its neighborhood in Donggala.
So far, all victims are from Pala, the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and around 540 are injured.
There are still people in the sort of buildings that the saviors have not been able to get out.
For example, the Roa Roa hotel in Palu has fallen.
The saviors say they heard the screams of the people trapped in the ruins, but the lack of a relief fleet has delayed the beginning of the rescues.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered military rescue and rescue.
There is a need for the military and its equipment, as in the disaster area electricity and communications connections are divided across many places.
Fuel reserves are also being exhausted.
The unfortunate response and long reflection of Miss Finland caused a laughter
Billnäs Ruuk is currently choosing a new Miss Finland.
In the interview round, every missionary was asked a question.
The finalists asked questions about the glass bowl on the stage.
In particular, the finalist number of the six Emilia Anttikoskiske, 23, the suspicious response was made to the public at the time of the sweets, but good-willed laughter.
The question to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ela wanted to know what the latest book was read by a missionary.
Anttikoski thought about his response in good time before he began to hesitate.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I read is... Anttikoski said, thinking.
The period of reflection took place in the public at the time of laughter, until Anttikoski continued her response:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I read is someone in economics, Anttikoski replied.
After his response, Anttikoski was allowed to make a public alouds with a laugh.
In the past, on a mission tour, Anttikoski drew attention because he did not want to pose in underwear due to his principle.
2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 2 p.m. when the crown will be abandoned last year by Miss Suomi Michaela Söderholm.
Sike Apple Pantyhose Takes Language By
This recipe is for you who have good, sour apples behind your own, because the domestic apple is at a shocking price in the store.
Perhaps you need to buy a pear, even though a lot of people think it's already growing.
This cake can also be made only from apples if the pear does not want to buy.
Of course, the taste is more diverse if the cake rains its main course.
Beef apples and pears and remove seedlings.
Go ahead.
You can melt in a boiler.
Stick the eggs and sugar into the foam and then add the corn flour to the foam and the melt can.
Combine corn starch, i.e. maize and baking powder, and add it to your dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Swipe bread with bread paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the goat and spread the pear slices on the sugar.
Luked half of the dough on the pears and apple blocks on the dough.
The rest of the dough on the apple blocks.
Mature in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Let it cool in a bed and then turn it off on the tray.
Just cut the cake well cold.
The cake is fragile in its structure and is easily broken because the dough has almond and corn flour with no gluten.

Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts of popularity
What makes people popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have described two slightly different types of “collarity”: the generally attractive coolness and, to that extent, the opposite dissidentism.
The attractively cool people had many socially desired features, according to the description of the researchers: they were turned out, friendly, friendly and qualified.
On the other hand, there was a typical distance, independence, rebellion, and perseverance for the dissidents.
They thirsted for experiences and cared little about external reviews.
Both types combined a good sense of self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of Kovis is no longer cool: a high status in a teenager does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what the American study published in Child Development in 2014.
For young people who were dating early, they were partying, looking for a good-looking group, and trying to favor others, there was an increased risk of using drugs as young adults and getting into crime.
In their human relationships, they did less than ever their unnoticed peers.
High status-messaged lock-cars, badges or watches do not make people a cool, or at least a truly attractive companion.
In a study published in August in Social Psychological and Personality Science, the majority of people were more willing to make friends with their regular market shirts than their sign shirts, despite the fact that most of them opted for a branding shirt.
If you're on the Greek holiday, watch out!
There's a fear storm coming in - the weather warning screams red.
During the weekend in southern Greece, it can rain as much water as in Finland, on average, over a period of six months.
Zorbas is attacking Greece during the weekend.
Be prepared if you are in the area of Peloponnes, the islands of Joonia, the Cyclades or the Crete.
The storm is very powerful, so the Finnish Embassy of Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the Embassy, the Greek air science service has given the regions a red weather warning.
The approaching storm is also reported in the Forecan blog.
According to this, the strongest hips in the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
Due to the comparison, Finland’s first week piesyt Kuisma storm blew its fairs in 31 meters per second.
According to the blog, the biggest concern of the Zorbas storm is not wind, but heavy rains.
The weekend in South Greece can be over 300 mm of water.
It corresponds to about half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
Weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the development of a storm on Facebook.
Zorbas storm has caused floods to Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the man’s death in Love Island UK?
Played with amazing YouTube videos
It is rare to know that in the Love Island in Finland, many men’s chanted beauty Anku also performs as an assortment of the YouTube videos published in 2010.
With videos, Anku advises askartists, among other things, to prepare the blues industry for the old economic paper roll.
Anku also shows her sympathetic style of how stockings can be askarrene on a silicone, where the right peaks grow.

Valtteri Bottas starred and bited the adrenaline in Sotshi, he's going to be Hamilton's assistant on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas starred a little more than ten minutes after his trip to the Russian Gp after he was in front of the media.
The great tour left Lewis Hamilton, the number one star of Mercedes, and was certainly an important criticism for the Finnish season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the solution round.
It feels good, I'm still a bit bright, but Bottas's got it.
I have been on the stake only once this year, in Austria (central), so the time has gone by.
This track has been good to me before, and I got good tours again.
It's not easy to skip the Sosh's track, so it's especially important to leave.
And, of course, Bottas was able to respond to the fight whether he was driving tomorrow for victory or whether he was in front of Hamilton's Jeesana approaching the World Cup.
My starting point in the race is definitely trying to win.
There can be no other goal when leaving the stake, Butts.
But as a stable, we fight both championships.
Lewis's lead, Sebastian Vettelin, is pretty big and the difference between me is very big, so you have to keep it in mind.
Let's see what's going on, But Bottas's full.
Hamilton was truly happy about the success of Bottax after the drive, and Mercedes' Talipomo Toto Wolff was also seen.
Lewis had the intention of winning Valtter, but he couldn't do it in a stalemate.
Valtteri knows she needs to tear everything herself apart to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline was squeezed out of the ears, Wolff hurried.
The question is whether or not to let Bottaks and Hamilton drive correctly, Wolff responded to the debate.
We'll talk tomorrow morning, and let's see how the race goes.
Kiteläinen Erno Kinnunen achieved the Finnish Championship in Rally
The Rally Car SM series rarely ended.
Never before have the brothers ended up being Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done by Tussolas Eerik and Henrik St. Petersburg in the final round in the environment of Turku and Salo, because Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
Kiteläinen Erno Kinnunen ensured the best achievement of his career when the third place of the final race sealed him from the SM4 category of two-wheeled cars of the Finnish Championship.
The Kinnunen and the map reader at Honda Civic started the Turku competition at the center, because the starting points were clear: the investment in the top group would guarantee the SM label.
In the dark of the Friday evening, the double had to give a balance when some of the additional lights were betrayed by another special test.
It's got a little bit of a blind-ass third.
In such a situation, it is not appropriate to talk.
On Saturday, only the second series was followed by Jussi Tepon, Kinnunen said.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, said that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is, according to him, close by.
In his speech at the UN, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to the country.
But there is no end to the seven years of war.
More than 360,000 people died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday in Germany that a meeting with Syria was scheduled for October, which would be attended by the Presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not quite Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans looked at the highest court judge-drained TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of being harassed, received an exceptionally large number of people.
The U.S. Supreme Court’s appointment drama gave at least 20 million people to their TVs on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and California Professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, was in front of the Senate Justice Committee.
According to the preliminary findings, six main channels (ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC) followed a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In order to increase the consultation online, there were millions more.
NBC reported that livestrims were followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported that they had performed their annual record with 8.2 million live broadcasts.
CNN numbers rise by more than 10 million, according to YouTube and Facebook, following the shipment.
Fox News Digital also started 8.0 million.
Digital startups are the channel’s own, TV viewers come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final readings on Monday, but they are in any case dizzy.
Rarely reach 20 million
More than 20 million viewers in the United States usually receive only sports games and great Oscars and Grammys, as well as random political events such as presidents' speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
The US’s most popular annual program, the American Football League’s NFL final match at Super Bowl is a trip.
This year, Super Bowl gathered around 103 million people to NBC.
Last year Trump's first speech to Congress, Nielsen said that nearly 48 million people and 30 million civil servants were considered.
The most important thing
The title of Supreme Court is an extremely important case in the United States, since the posts are life-long.
Trump had already appointed a new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent the president of Barack Obama from appointing him a successor.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was a Republican president appointed by Ronald Reagan, but he was in a number of questions in the so-called \"va'an\" language, whose voice may have been resolved by the nine-person court.
He was an advocate of abortion law and sexual minorities’ rights, for example, in 2015, he decided that the same-sex people were granted marriage law throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His election to the Supreme Court may be locked up for decades by the Conservative League.
Children have the right to know their parents
Only parents of children under 10 years of age see their children’s health information about Kanta.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Originally, the situation of Kanta was, of course, even more worrying: the parents could not even see the health data or recipes of the minors.
A temporary correction was made in the autumn of 2016 for people under the age of 10.
Since then, the practices have been promised to be repaired, but the repair has been going on for an amazing long time.
Now the correction is in the promise - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the amendment of the legal basis should not have been more than through the auction.
After that, the understanding of the terrain is about pressing the button: when the spray is held, it will be opened.
The child may show his knowledge to his parents if he has a bank ID or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds have?
The ID card is paid, and the bank IDs are not even available when they are 10 years old.
The data of the four-class class of the primary school can therefore not be seen in practice by anyone other than asking them to be printed.
It is not about the right of parents as well as the right of children.
It is extremely important that parents can be involved in the care of the child.
Of course, the right of teens to privacy must be ensured.
Even minors can have family situations in which all things cannot be freely discussed.
Often, they relate to sexual health, which is deeply concerned with the issue of human rights.
In the United States, the FBI began the harassment of Kavanaugh.
According to U.S. media, the FBI is investigating at least two harassment charges made by women.
One of the women was heard earlier this week by the Senate Justice Committee.
Kavanaugh has denied accusations concerning alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The survey shall not take longer than one week.
According to Washington Post, it's a criminal investigation about a more limited investigation, and it's not necessarily publicized.
He threatened to kill the police at the police station in Kajaan
The interested bomber continued to bullying even in the chamber.
Police say they put a man in a police prison to calm down.
The police were charged with a suspect's threat on Saturday night in Kajaan.
Officialism informs about the case that began when a decent 30-vutia man challenged a violent dispute at the central restaurant.
The man first abused another client within the nutrition movement.
This led to the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, the fighters attacked another man by pouring him down on the ground.
When the third party tried, the man still hit him.
The trial led to the call of the police.
The party caught the man and took him to Kajaan's police station, the police say.
The suspect was still aggressive at the police station.
The man kicked another cop in his leg.
He threatened to kill and abuse the police.
Police say they've sent a man to a police prison to calm down.
The man is suspected of three assaults and a violent opposition to the official.
Aid organisations are preparing to start their work at Sulawes in Indonesia – the most urgent -
UN Children's Organization Unicef and other international assistance organizations are ready to help the island of Sulawes, Indonesia, says Kirsi Haru, Finland's Information Manager, Kirsi Haru.
Local authorities are leading rescues, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
Alongside normal operations, Unicef always has full emergency response, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in ruins, both survivors and dead.
Please, in the city of Sulawes, rescue operations are ongoing, but the situation in the area of Donggala is slightly deeper.
There are still places where the connections are not working.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
The buildings are often light structures at Sulawes, so the damage caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need protection - at first, for example, tents - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
First of all, people are usually able to offer water purification tablets that are also in stock.
Water systems are to be repaired as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, the water is transported to the primary emergency, for example by trucks.
In times of crisis, many children will get rid of their parents.
Finding family members and combining families is part of Unicef’s mission.
Food aid is organised, among other things, by the World Food Programme (WFP) as part of the UN.
In the initial phase, the funds previously collected are used for emergency aid.
For example, Unicef has already started a fundraising campaign to help the victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Billioner Elon Musk to terminate Tesla as Chairman of the Board - $20 million fines for tweets
Elon Musk, founder of space rockets and electric cars, avoid fraud charges in an agreement with the U.S. Securities Commission.
The Billioner Elon Musk will terminate his duties as chairman of the Tesla Board and agree to the fine of $20 million.
Musk resigns as part of the mission of the contract he entered into with the U.S. Securities Market Supervisory Authority.
By agreeing to avoid fraud.
The U.S. Securities Commission (SEC) threatened Muskia for his tweets sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing Tesla's electric car company to withdraw from the stock market, which resulted in a rapid increase in the company's share rate.
According to the agreement, Musk must not be president of the Tesla Board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new and independent member of its Board and take two independent directors of its management team.
Tesla also needs to set up a Committee to monitor Musk's communication.
Musk can continue as Tesla's CEO.
In addition to the €20 million fines in the Musk, Tesla also has to pay 20 million equivalent fines to the financial supervisor.
Twiits Mistake the Investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets led investors and Tesla shareholders to be misled.
Musk claimed that he would have ensured funding that Tesla would be bought back from the stock exchange as a private limited company.
According to the billionaire's tweets, the company would have been bought out of the stock exchange for $420.
Tesla’s share rate rose by more than ten per cent per day after the tweets, but decreased later.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims had no basis.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually discussed the financing he claimed.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal of the stock exchange with the other management team or the board of the company.
On Friday this week, the exchange rate dropped by 14 per cent when the securities supervisor, SEC, announced the fraud charge.
The new agreement is expected to strengthen the company's course again.
The final judgment is not a reason
The clocks of the court do not, of course, sound when the wisesters do not move.
It's a technical mistake.
The clock of the Tower of the Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
Visas show at 12:00.
The situation is like the average horror film: even when the church's crypt was part of the play and the mouths were to fight themselves.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped because of the technical reason: it is broken.
It's happened to be looked at by the repairer, but some of the parts are broken, and it's expected to be a new part, Sunniina Jamsen says.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki -Twitter account.
The account mentions that the last sentence is not the reason for stopping the watch.
Jamsen says the clocks of the church don't sound because of the fault.
