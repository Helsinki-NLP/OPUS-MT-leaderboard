A 9-year-old boy in Tampere was found
The police have had a search for a 9-year-old boy on a run in Tampere on Tuesday night.
The disappearance declaration on the boy who left West Camperere with his friend has spread on social media.
According to the police's situation centre, the boy has been contacted and has no risk of life and health.
The son's father told Ilta-Sanom in the half-night knowing that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start the ex-post investigation.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home, Dad told me.
Ronaldo again as a charm - tear the paint difference to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish league weekend and continued his factory in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo from the Champions League was turned to the latter for at least a moment.
Real Madrid Ronaldo went to the top of all time's goalmaker statistics when he shot a visitor on Shahar Donetsk's network two hits of penalty kicks and one of the gaming situations.
Ronaldo raised his paint balance to 80 when before Tuesday, the Barcelona Mess had 77 hits.
Real won 4-0.
Juventus has been in the Italian football league at Serie A since the beginning, but in the Champions League's D-section it began with a 2-1 tour race from Manchester City.
The powerless ball made a lot of ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack was boring because of the absence of the knee-catching Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend of the election game, came to the field only in the last ten minutes.
Manchester’s second club, United, also experienced hardship in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after having suffered a 1-2 loss.
The manU's 20-year-old lawyer Luke Shaw's guest match lasted only a quarter of an hour.
The dangerously looking sliding guarantee of PSV Hector Moreno hit the goal towards an attacking ManU package so badly that Shaw probably broke his leg.
Shaw slept on the Eindhoven home stadium lawn tens of minutes before the medical staff went to carry him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests to a 1-0 line in 41 minutes, but the pleasure of ManU lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno leveled up before the break.
In the second half, the PSV’s victory paint was made by Luciano Narsingh.
In the World Cup, Paris Saint-Germain began the A-block.
Manchester United's shirt's PSG knife was replaced by Argentine Angel Di Maria.
Di Maria broke through the right and raised the ball in the back corner by Malmö's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made the second half for PSG 2-0.
PSG has been played among the successes of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö is not the best target for comparison.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, PSG’s astronomer, met for the first time with his professional career.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team Moscow TsSKA lost the B-block in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately called for a difference - the president took the wrong speech
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had held a month ago.
President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has again spoken the same speech in the country's parliament at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe was 91 years old in full spirit power.
The chief opposition party, MDC, asked Mugabe to resign because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants rushed to say that the confusion had happened only in Mugabe’s seat and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech dealt with earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional meeting of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, will assess the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to make more effective registration in Europe.
Negotiations on asylum seekers are included in the Internal Ministers' table.
Professor admitted in an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend.
Professor Shannon Lamb of the University asked for a sound of a bit of a star police officer at his house and told him he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb mentioned in particular that their beloved dog was here and alive and probably scared. The professor told me that the contact details of the dead woman's family would be on the woman's phone.
Inside the house, the police found a message written by Amy Prentiss' body and white paper: “I’m very sorry and I hope that I could cancel my actions. I loved Amy, and she’s the only woman who ever loved me, according to the authorities I read in a letter signed by Lamb.
There were no signs that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, had already traveled 500 kilometers to the school campus. The police found a professor Ethan Schmidt, who was believed to have been shot by Lamb.
Lynn Buford, chief of police at Delta State University, said that the university's authority was informed of the shooting at 10:18 in the morning.
She said Lamb called a fatal emergency call for some time after that.
There was another death in the day, and Lamb took his own life when the police caught him.
The next day, students and faculty kept their visuals behind closed doors, and the authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb’s motive.
The researchers examined the details in both locations, and the students who knew Lamb told them about the man. Researchers were born with a picture of a talented but perhaps problematic teacher.
Students always said they were looking forward to the professor’s hours.
According to the Gautier Police Department of the Prentiss, the professor had no previous background of violence or crime.
Schmidt, on the other hand, had mentioned Lamb's book, which had given recognition to the human beings, with whom he was able to spend academic life.
Both of them worked at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, which had 17 teaching staff members. Many of the students attended the courses of both men.
However, there were five problems.
The student, Brandon Beavers, praised by Lamb, said that the professor seemed excited and nervous, as if he had something wrong.
Another student, Michael Sykes, said that Lamb had told him about stress at the end of the academic year 2014-2015.
Lamb had previously applied Delta State University for medical leave due to some kind of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's salary policy meant that the dissertation for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically provide him with the assistant professor's office.
Professor William LaForge of the University said that he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that Lamb was clearly troubled by something.
These questions, Lamb, can't be answered anymore.
After leaving campus, the police found out what route Lamb had become from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police hit Lamb, he had taken his own life with a 38-caliber pistol in the back yard of the house in the Mississippi Greenville, about a half mile from his parents' home, Washington County's death investigator, Methel Johnson said.
Lamb's car was still running in the yard.
The police didn't immediately find out why Lamb had just gone to this house, but Johnson said he believed he knew the people of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb began his work as a teacher of geography and education at a university with 3 500 students. The city had 12,000 inhabitants in 2009.
He got his doctoral degree in the spring.
One of Lamb’s most long-term friends described this as smart, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me she met with Lamb's friends when she was 15 and Lamb 20 years old.
She was still in high school with friends, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried to teach Hairston guitar.
“The lamp was a fairly heartbroker at that time.
All the girls were with her doctor, said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were probably dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but no documents suggest that they were not married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in a river resort in the small town of Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me he had divorced Prentis 15 years ago. The couple had remained friends, and they have a daughter who is now 19.
He was so shocked, O'Steen said about his daughter.
The daughter and mother were best friends.
O'Steen had not met Lamb but heard from her daughter, Abigail, that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail appeared in both summer events three years ago.
Later, they sometimes called together.
According to O'Steen, his daughter plays and plays her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and a part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Jules Room outside Gauter, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, when Lamb had played guitar and lipstick for a rare audience.
There was nothing to say that something was wrong.
\"A happy couple,\" Shaffer said.
“We visited together.
Both had a good sense of humor.
“The professor Schmidt, who had received his death, directed the seminars for the first year and was specialized in the history of Indians and colonial times,” says Professor Don Allan Mitchell of England.
He was married and had three children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was chairman of his own brotherhood and student class.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, there were 900 people gathered for a memorial event in the candlelight, including teaching staff, other staff, students, and residents of the region.
Schmidt’s wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the night’s event where the university choir presented the songs “Bright Morning Star” and “Amazing Grace”
The lesson continues on Wednesday.
\"We're trying to get students back,\" LaForge said.
“The crisis is over.
This is a healing day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report to Mississippi Cleveland.
Assistant suppliers: Associated Press Suppliers Emily Wagner Pettus Mississippi in Greenville and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, as the police now say that Lamb called an emergency call after the shooting of Schmidt. It was also noted that even though Lamb referred to the emergency call as his wife of Prentiss, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us is not going to hire as many seasonal workers as last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products tells his current employees and seasonal workers that he will offer additional hours of work.
The company plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres across the country. In 2014, it employed 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
Interviews with applicants will begin this month, and new employees will start in October to December.
Although there are still months of holidays, the trade season is approaching a good pace, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers for stores and delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about her date - Princess Diana
Back to the future film was an important moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The first night also had a personal significance.
“We sat in the theater and waited for the royals to arrive. I noticed that there was an empty place next to me, and I was told that Princess Diana was coming to me, and Fox told me the future Back in Time document in the trailer.
“When the movie started, I realized that the situation reminded me of a lot of dates with the Princess of Wales.
The Back in Time document is linked to the Return to the Future movies, and the document is interviewed in addition to Fox by Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd and director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future, the movie got its first night 30 years ago.
\"This movie is definitely a time travel movie for me,\" Spielberg said.
Back in Time is published in VOD and DVD format and is presented in selected cinemas since October.
UN Secretary General: No Military Solution in Syria
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia's enhanced military action and notes that almost five years of conflict has no military solution and that arms only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The secretary-general again called on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to join their forces and to support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At the Wednesday press conference, Ban announced his intention to meet five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria.
Ban regretted the fact that the fragmentation of the security council, the Syrian people and regional forces has caused a situation that is impossible to resolve.
In the context of the Syrian crisis, Ban called on five permanent Member States to show the same solidarity and unity that reached Iran’s nuclear agreement.
Is Donald Trump serious?
Trump has been tried to bake into an empty bowler.
He was also considered a joke.
Some predict Trump's collapse.
The Republican circles have (six) achieved their results in every way to pull Trump down from the galulp wire.
Ten of the eleven national gallup shows Donald Trump two-digit support numbers. Some think seriously about what it actually tells about the possibilities of the real estate module.
But the elections are only in the early stages.
No one has yet declared Trump to be a Republican candidate.
The experts remind me that Rick Perry, who was in the gallosphere of 2011 at this time, was able to give space to the emerging Herman Cain. Neither of them eventually won the stand-alone plant in any state.
Trump would be difficult in general elections for many reasons.
External groups, such as the Jeb Bush Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth, have noted Trump’s strong position and began to dig into the grave to cover him.
The following recent gallulum data show that the real estate mogul cannot be ignored by customization:
Trump's support has been a full-fledged version.
Just before Trump announced that he was a candidate in mid-June, the University of Monmouth’s gallup said that only two of the ten Republicans had a positive picture of property.
By mid-July, 40% had a positive image.
The proportion at the beginning of the film was 52%.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten images are negative.
These figures are also held in states where elections are held first.
In the last week, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two third Republicans would be satisfied with Trump's nomination.
Last week 67% of Republicans in CNN and ORC’s gallup said they were very happy or satisfied with Trump’s choice as candidates.
Only two out of ten would be very dissatisfied with Trump's nomination.
Ben Carson is almost as eager to receive as Trump (43% would be very satisfied with Carson's nomination and 40% on Trump's nomination).
Who is the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, whose equivalent contribution is 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were elected candidates for the party.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump’s temperament problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticized for volume and offensive comments. 52% of Republican supporters across the country consider the properties of the property mogul suitable for the president. The views are reflected in the opinion of ABC News and Washington Post.
The same is true for Iowa, where the party meeting is first held: According to the Quinn market galaxy, 52% of Republicans consider Trump’s personal qualities appropriate to the chief of defence forces.
However, according to ABC and Post Gallupe, 44% believe Trump is unable to function effectively in the task, and six out of ten consider Trump’s temperament inappropriate to the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected as a party candidate, according to CNN and the ORC gallop, four out of ten believe Trump’s potential.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on Jeb Bush's behalf.
Total: Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball before.
At this point, in the last election, four of the ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a likely candidate, and only 28 percent of Mitt Romney.
Most people seem to think Trump's campaign is convincing.
Even if Republicans supported another candidate, Trump covers almost all other candidates.
Some experts believe that a divided camp is likely to benefit Trump when Trump’s opponents are divided into different candidates.
At the beginning of September, Monmouth University’s opinion poll revealed that Trump and almost any other Republican candidate would have a larger support group almost always.
He leads to Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubita with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paulia, John Kasichi and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's on the level.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson took the victory from Trump with 19 points apart in a imaginary double-deck.
A small majority of Trump’s supporters have already made a vote.
According to the gallup published on Tuesday by CBS and NYT, half of Trump’s supporters are sure to vote.
Of course, the situation can change for many reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump’s supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's very competitive at this moment is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already elected their candidate are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump’s view of migration.
In his campaign, Donald Trump's campaign, two months ago, migrant rapes from Mexico have been a hot topic for 2016.
Some are concerned about the fact that Trump’s massive speeches deport important Latin American voters from the Republicans and hamper brand renewal.
According to the opinion polls of ABC News and Washington Post on Monday, six out of ten Republicans are on the same lines as Trump.
As long as migration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Lack of satisfaction with the administration is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republicans' votes. The popularity is significantly increased by the fact that both of them have come out of office.
The Republican groups wanted to be a candidate for a fresh face instead of a political coup, according to ABC News and Washington Post's latest opinion poll, six out of ten Republicans had this view.
These two candidates are also passionate about Washington.
According to the opinion of Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Iowa, three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the activities of Republicans in Congress: 54% are dissatisfied and 21% on the edge of the rage.
Jeremy Corby's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
After the elections, Corbyn's first appearance at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been welcome.
The new film by Labour's working party Jeremy Corbyn is expected to rise for the first time not to stand up for David Cameron's research class later.
Corby is asking her first six questions a little after half a day. The media and Labour Party representatives follow the man's eye hard.
Corbyn has called less theater and adds more facts to a weekly show.
He has also stated that he can skip some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
Corbyn's leadership will be weighed for the first time. Corby's parliamentary test will now be carried out after the meeting of the shadow government and the central organization of Corbyn's Trade Unions at the TUC's annual meeting on Tuesday.
The decision of the Labour Party to close the national song during the 75th anniversary of the British Air War on Tuesday has received criticism from several representatives of the Tory Party. The debate has also ended in the headlines of several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence during the National Song
Corbyn's representative stated that Corbyn's position during the national singing was respected in silence by the Sanctuary of Royal Air Forces in the Battle of Britain.
However, Mr. Owen Smith of Corbyn's shadow government said in the BBC's Two's News program that he would have called the leader of the party to join the National Song despite the opposition of this monarchy.
The 10 shadow ministers have refused to go to Corbyn's tops, calling for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Less than a sixth of the party initially supported the election of Corbyn to party management.
Robin Brant, a spokesman for BBC’s policy, considers that political differences in the EU membership of the United Kingdom and the conditions for granting the government’s benefits have been accumulated in the Labour Party since Corbyn’s appointment.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC meeting that Labour would propose amendments to remove restrictions altogether.
For hours later, Minister of Labour and Pension Smith of the shadow government said that the party's position is very clear: it only opposes the government's plans to calculate the limit from 26,000 to 23,000.
Corbyn is the fifth Director of Labour, which David Cameron meets over the past decade under the leadership of the Tory Party.
The new approach to politics promised by the Labour Director says he has chosen Cameron's questions to be addressed to the general public on 30,000 proposals.
According to Corbyn, elected from the Islington North electoral district, there are too many cohesive meetings in the poll, and he promises to avoid clever words of speech and petitions and instead say he focuses on serious topics such as poverty, inequality and youth challenges.
Corbyn has said that the shadow minister Angela Eagle will bring her to the polls, for example, when Cameron is on a trip abroad.
Corbyn has also thrown the idea in the air that others may also be able to get out at times and that he has been talking about it with Parliament's sub-room president, John Bercowin.
As Corbyn joined the party leadership in 2005, Cameron said he wanted a doll theater policy, often associated with a survey, but some years later he admitted that he failed.
Since the first time in 1990, it has been considered as a key measure of the driver’s judgment, sub-room management and position. However, critics say that the survey recognition has become a caricature that needs massive reforms.

Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.
There has been a meaningful way to learn and earn for the former group of street children.
“I was shot in Joburg” is a non-profit imaging studio where learning homeless young people to photograph their home and earn at the same time.

Pounds are strengthened in the rise of UK wages
The pound was strengthened in the rise of wages in the UK, and SABMiller drew the FTSE 100 index to rise.
In May to July, wages rose by 2.9 per cent in the UK compared to the corresponding period last year. Bonuses were not calculated.
The accelerated growth forecast was the fastest since 2009.
The pound was strengthened by 1%, and its rate was quoted to $1.505. The pound was also strengthened in relation to the euro, and recorded at EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and reached 6.229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, whose rate was reduced by 20 per cent when the company received an initial bid from AB InBev.
When it comes to trading, the world’s two largest breweries would combine and bring under the same roof brands, including, for example, Budweiser, Stella Artis, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share rose by 0.9% in old water’s positive outcome of the Richemont Group, which focuses on luxury products.
Richemont's latest sales figures are better than forecast. The development of sales was also a rise in Burberry's key market in China.
Glencore’s share rose by 5% of the mining company’s announced intentions to raise its share of $2.5 billion as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the Packing and Paper Group Mondi were the largest dropper with a drop of 4.3% when Goldman Sachs dropped the price of the company’s shares for sale.
The JD Sports course rose by 3.1% after the announcement of the sports company that its return before taxes rises by 83% to £46.6 million.
JD Sports: higher wage spending could be detrimental to enlargement
According to Peter Cowgilll, the chairman of the JD Sports Management Team, the minimum wage increase in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not enough to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgilli, the increase in labour costs can jeopardise JD Sports enlargement plans and reduce the need for additional labour force.
Metcash launches a grass root campaign against Aldi's swing
Metcash seeks to secure its IGA sale from Aldi in South and West Australia.
Metcash, a food wholesaler, has launched a grass root campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retail stores in South and West Australia against the $700 million Australian invasion of Aldin.
Aldi will open two distribution centres and the first up to 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA-supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build an IGA brand on marketing in mainstream communications and social media, as well as by organising events such as Adelaide Show.
IGA stores and suppliers as well as many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, the ice cream factory Simmo, located in Dunsborough, offers taste in IGA stores, and traders sell tickets to carrier customers to South Australia football league games at a discount price.
Metcashi is expected to publish more detailed information about its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and iron trade team will organise the annual investment strategy day.
This is a major market, as South and West Australia account for almost 30% of Metcashi's IGA sales footprint, and in these areas the coverage is greater than the IGA sales network of Eastern states.
South and Western Australian consumers are known for their corner population, and IGA traders have a significantly higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. In South Australia, the market share is 30 per cent and in West Australia 24 per cent, while in the eastern states only 14 per cent.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi will catch 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening up the first stores.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA traders can sell 360 million and Metcash 250 million dollars of holiday by the end of 2016.
The prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Australia next year and reach 500 million dollars and 600 million dollars for sale in these areas.
The fixed costs of Metcashi are high, so the loss of food sales and volatility can mean a loss of $13 million in the result before interest rates and taxes, Kierath says.
At the same time, Metcast loses market share in the eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although Roy Morgan’s recent study shows that IGA’s customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi's food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018.
Last week, the leading portfolio manager of Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglas, told Melbourne that it was very likely that Metcash would disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to publicly comment on Douglas's comments.
It is understandable that the Board member of Metcashi contacted Douglas last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and the result of Metcashi’s food business, serving the 1200 IGA dealer, has fallen by 43% from 2012 levels.
However, the wholesale operator takes countermeasures and makes more than $150 million of Australian dollars a year of rain in response to Coles and Woolworths prices for hundreds of products weekly. Ketju wants to support traders in the renewal of stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the choice of food for trade marks.
Metcashi’s CEO, Ian Morrice, said the price review and sales reform plans are in good pace, and the company is able to increase its profits again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Australia’s tennis union president Steve Healy defends Thanasi Kokkiknak
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his behavior instead of the criticism of special mention.
According to Steve Healy, Australia's tennis union president, Shanasi Kokkinakis has been a victim of the recent Nick Kyrgios jukakas, who deserves a special mention rather than a critic.
\"The two younger parties named \"Special K\", Kokkinkakis, were forced into an unfavorable light film when the evil boy Kyrgios provocated his opponent Stan Wawrinka in Montreal's ATP tournament.
Soon thereafter, in the game between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison, the judge was forced to split the competition partners twice. “Wawrinka should have given back to the Kyrgios and my friend,” Harrison said.
In the U.S. Open, Kokkinakis was frustrated at the field of the batry when the strong cramps ruined his fight. Heally has faithfully defended Kokkinak.
At the moment, the Teen Star is in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth from the two-player Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup's semifinal against the UK.
“I strongly believe that your Thana has been dragged into the dispute,” Healy said.
He broke the bat when he lost the game in the US open. He is not the first player to break his mail due to frustration. I know Thanas well enough that he is not proud of his performance.
However, he has been very successful, for example, in the provocative use of Harrison in the U.S. Open, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature at age 19, he works hard and completes a very team. He has never had any problems with other players, and he is respected among the players. He practises hard, is in a good condition and is a really stable and mature young man. I think he should be evaluated based on his own sea routes.
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from Australia's team on the basis of an important round. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision for all parties. However, he is in favour of the Canberra educator to return to the team for a long time.
“First of all, we want to focus entirely on the matches in place of the Kyrgios-related poles,” Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Federer and Murray have pointed out, the young man has to grow up in the light of publicity. He deserves his criticism of his bad mistakes. However, we try to support him to understand the consequences of his actions. We also try to organize his own peace for him. I believe that it is best for both the whole team and Nick.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
The state of emergency declared Hungary closed its southern border from Serbia on Tuesday and captured illegal migrants, with a view to preventing the flow of migrants.
There was chaos on the border when hundreds of immigrants gathered in no country, and the Serbian authorities responded in a rage.
People fleeing violence had to stay on the road between the control positions of the countries for an indefinite period of time.
The destruction began to rise to the surface.
As the police helicopter flew in the air above the migrants, they hurried, “Open the border, and shouted insults to the Hungarian Mellacaupolis.
Some were protesting about eating and drinking.
The Serbian Foreign Minister announced that it would not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as further arrivals from Macedonia and Greece.
“Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not increase damage.
The situation must be discussed in Brussels and in other countries in the coming days,\" Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
At the border between Hungary and Serbia, Kuohunta started a day later when the 28-state group failed to develop a common immigration policy at the controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, that the responsibility for the flooding of 40,000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was shared, and that the meeting hoped that by next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached on which EU Member States would receive 120 000 migrants, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria invited an additional summit on Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis of the continent.
However, Hungary did not hope for urgent action by Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that in two southern regions, the authorities were allowed to adopt more effective means, i.e. to close you and speed up the legal processes relating to asylum.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary is also planning a peak on the Romanian border in order to prevent the flow of migrants from the direction that now the Serbian border is ready for aid.
CBS News's correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports that even prisoners participated in the final work of the Hungarian-Serbia peaks.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and transit point for migrants to the European Union, and many of these migrants are refugees from Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that most of the people who arrive are living-level refugees, not war refugees who have the right to seek security.
According to the new law that entered into force in Hungary at midnight, it is a crime to cross or damage a four-meter high-end wire fence that the government has built on the southern border towards Serbia. The law also defines longer prison periods for convicted merchants.
“As a result of the situation caused by migration, the government declares a crisis situation in the country, the government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the city of Szeged in the south of the country.
“We follow a strict line: illegal border crossing is a crime.”
In practice, Parliament must continue to adopt military measures that are expected next week. Suppliers of the Associated Press News Office have been seeing heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, the internal security adviser of Orban, said that the authorities have captured 45 border crossings in an attempt to immediately cross the border and 15 distances away.
By damaging the border, people who have crossed the border are now in the possession of the police, who are accused of crimes based on new laws.
The authorities quickly repair the fence.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossings at the border of Serbia on Tuesday. One border crossing site was closed by a train wagon covered with wire wire.
The chaos took over the main border crossing point near Roske in Hungary, when Hungarians opened a small metal container to the point where people packed in.
About 20 were in, but thousands were out.
The second group of immigrants blocked the main street that connects Serbia and Hungary. People announced that they were at the food and beverage store until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership with Bernie Sanders reduced side by side of the national galaxy
The support percentage of former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still two-digit in the race as the national candidate for Presidents.
Clinton's support now stands at 47% of the votes of the Democrats (decrease 58%), while Sanders has a second 27% support (up from 17%).
The Vice President, Joe Biden, has not yet announced his possible departure to the presidential race, and his support among the Democrats is 15%.
It is too early to tell the majority of the Democrats who they are in favour of.
Clinton’s supporters, however, are more likely to support other candidates.
Since the call made by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost support from a number of democratic groups, while new supporters have joined the Sanders camp.
Clinton still has a solid leadership position among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed down.
Clinton's support among men has fallen significantly and has only a five percent bow compared to Sanders.
Clinton has lost his leadership among Democrats under the age of 50 and is now on the level with Sanders.
Clinton, however, has a clear preference among older voters.
In the last month Clinton's premier contribution to Sanders was two-digit among liberals, but now Sanders has taken five percentage points of neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats are happy to announce their support for Clinton if he is elected as a party candidate.
The fourth would support Clinton with small reservations, and 15 percent would support him only because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support Clinton.
It is no surprise that Clinton’s current supporters would also be particularly enthusiastic if he was elected a candidate.
There is more dissipation among those who do not currently support Clinton, and only about a quarter would support him with enthusiasm.
Of the voters, 48% would be in favour of Clinton, while only 35% of Republican voters would strongly support the most popular Republican candidate Donald Trump.
When Clinton's voters are asked to describe why they support her nomination, the most popular justification is Clinton's right experience (16%). Secondly, the most popular answer is that it is time to choose a female president (13%) and, thirdly, Clinton is the best candidate for the task (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mention his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
In addition, common views and opportunities to win the real elections are mentioned.
The Vice-President will continue to weigh his possible nominations, and 57% of Democrats would like him to go to the race, and the third would rather leave him out of the race.
When the Democrats are asked for the second most popular candidate, most of them choose Biden.
Clinton’s supporters over half of the Biden are the second most popular candidate after Clinton and much more popular in Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democratic candidate race, Hillary Clinton will increase his way towards Sanders. With Sanders, the front trip will be 20 percentage points, and it will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
55% of Democrats consider Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the real elections, but the share has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden, the second, is far from Clinton, but more and more believe in Biden’s ability to win the real elections.
Democrats, however, consider the views on issues more important to the candidates’ winning opportunities.
voters do not consider candidates for Democrats or potential candidates to be unacceptable.
voters consider candidates for Democrats or potential candidates suitable for their characteristics.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest, reliable and leadership types.
Biden is often described as honest, while Clinton is considered the most common type of leader.
Of Democrats, up to 30% do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, and Sanders is 15%. 27% cannot say if Sanders is honest.
Democrats believe that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden’s views are close to voters’ own ideology.
About a quarter of all features have no opinion about Sanders.
When the voters are asked about the use of Hillary Clinton’s private email and its own server as a foreign minister, most of the Democrats say they are satisfied with Clinton’s explanation and have not changed the opinion of these voters about Clinton.
The Americans disagree more widely.
Half of Americans are dissatisfied with Clinton's report, and only one third is satisfied.
The opinion of the people was divided in March, when the conflict had just become public.
Most Americans believe that the use of the controversial e-mail has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36% say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of these 36 percent, six out of ten, are Republicans.
While voters of their party consider Clinton honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these features when asking for the views of all voters: Clinton sees as honest and reliable only 32%, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
Of all voters, 62% do not think Clinton is honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters in the whole country do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, have a good reputation for leadership.
Six candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered more reliable.
The majority consider Sanders honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion about Sanders.
The sample of the survey is 351 voters and the error margin of the survey is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is closing Donald Trump's premiere in a national response survey.
CBS News and the New York Times's latest survey on suffering shows that Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates had more than half of the votes in the new survey and left the other candidates far behind.
Trump still has a strong support among Republican voters in the whole country. The contribution has risen from 23% of CBS survey conducted before Fox News in the last month. According to a survey published on Tuesday, the support rate is 27%.
However, Carson's support would be a huge increase in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has strong support for all groups of the population.
Other candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, remain far away. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker’s support is weakest and has fallen from 10% in the last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio, Florida, shared their third position with a support of 6%.
The error margin of 376 Republican voters in the sample is 6% in the direction or another. The survey was conducted in September.
According to the latest survey by CNN and the ORC last week, Carson's support is rising, 19% of Republicans, while Trump's support is 32%.
Also in the latest survey by ABC News and Washington Post, Trump was in a clear lead before Carson.
In the last week of the men's encounter, Trump fired an unrivaled accusation against retired neurosurgeons, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
\"We need energy,\" Trump said on Saturday in his campaign at Iowa.
Five members of the department accused of the death of Baruch College Fuks
Nearly two years ago, after the death of a student in the Department of Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people are charged with murder.
The members of the department at Baruch College (City University of New York) Pi Delta Pss were brutally abused in the baptisms of Chun-Michael-Deng in September 2013. According to the police, the department did not deliver Deng in time to the hospital, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the eyes of the victim were tied, his back had been placed almost 15 kilos of sand-filled backpack and had been repeatedly attacked by him trying to get to the site that was placed on the other side of the ice field.
Deng is first told about the headache he was complaining about and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, the members of Pi Delta Ps's department didn't call the emergency number when Deng lost consciousness, and they're supposed to have been waiting an hour before Deng was taken to the hospital.
Policeman Chris Wabner said at a press conference, however, that members were able to change Deng's clothes, googla his symptoms, and contact the president of the department Andy Mengi.
At this point, the members began to hide the tools, putting the department's interests ahead of Michael Deng's health,\" Wagner said.
Deng was not resuscitated and died the next morning.
According to the physique, Deng had been hit several times in the head, upper body, and traveling with a boring object.
“A lot of families have been shocked by the company’s sympathies because at least one student per year has died as a result of the sympathization since 1970,” says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The departments and their members must be held responsible for taking an important step.
The great jury of the Monroe County presented five members of the department to blame for the murder of the third-degree.
In addition, 32 members of the department are accused of blackmail and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
“We want to be responsible not only for individuals, but also for the organisation officially or informally approved by the simulation,” Wagner said on Tuesday.
Baruch College imposed an operating ban on the department, and the national department resigned from the operation of the local department.
Thus, the increase in the interest rates of the US Central Bank (Fedin) affects
The increase in interest rates and the increase in the stock market has become fragile, the return on securities is rising and the economy is falling.
That's what we know.
We do not know how long it will take and how long it will last.
In particular with regard to the economy, we find a historical reference to the timing.
Lama has arrived up to 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank is often aggressively raising interest rates, not always. The crucial factor is how the economy and financial resources react.
That is why the central bank officials have already stressed the fact that investors would not pay attention to the start of raising interest rates but to how long the normalisation of the situation takes.
There are a number of variables involved.
In the end, market players can note that any increase in interest rates can be exaggerated.
“The first increase in the central bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often considered as a sign of the end of cheap money,” Julian Jessop, the Chief Economics Chief of the World Economics told its customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual normalization of interest rates to a rather low level. It is a frightening standing shock for many.
However, it does not mean that there is no impact.
Examples of how impacts can be seen in different areas of the economy, based on historical trends:
As has been seen on the market for about a month, interest rate increases can increase instability for some time.
When the interest finally rises, the effect is not so dramatic.
“The trend seems to be the increase in the return on capital after the first increase for 12-24 months, perhaps reflecting a delay in monetary policy, the Deutsche Bank analyst said in a recent study of the effects of the increase in interest rates.
A sharp rise in interest rates, around 14%, relatively steady for the next 250 days (average 2.6%), after 500 days, the situation will be normalised, and the average interest income after the six stock periods will be 14.4 percent, according to Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management’s Chief Equity Strategy in Barron’s.
According to Deutsche, the impact on shares is generally slightly more pronounced at a later stage and interest rates start to decrease.
The recession is a fact in the economy, but the rise in interest rates usually works on it.
In this case, if the central bank encounters conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate the billing ratio.
Particular attention is paid to the fact that the gross domestic product is at its lowest ever in view of the increase in the central bank's control rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 interest rates have been raised since 1950, only twice the nominal value has been less than 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 is 3.6%, many have not imagined it to be sustainable, and in the third quarter there is 1.5%, according to the Regional Bank of Atlanta.
When raising interest rates in such a sensitive economic situation, there can be a risk and it can be asked whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
The market participants have been talking about raising the steering rate throughout the year, and the views turn to this week's Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategies and economics believe that even if the open market committee agreed to pick up at this meeting, future trade only looks like a 25% chance.
“From 1950 onwards, all withdrawal cycles have been in the supercycle, which also rises very rapidly since the rise of the recession, according to the report.
Recovery has been very slow compared to the worst recession in the comparison period.
Sykli is clearly the longest that the central bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now it is already going for 74 months.
Fixed-income securities have also been unstable in the past on the market with interest rates, and the formula is also repeated on the capital side.
The difference is that the effect is faster in bonds than in shares when the central bank changes the course.
In the case of bonds, the return appears to change the direction as soon as the first up/down cycle starts.
At the end of the rise cycle, the outputs will drop immediately, Deutsche said.
Charles Schwabin’s strategyists believe that the interest rate will bring long and short-term bonds closer to each other and that the curve will be levelled.
“The high-volume bonds are often better in this environment, although we are still cautious about the returns,” said Kathy Jones, the analyst of the fixed-income securities in Schwab.
Surprisingly, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future change in the direction of the central bank.
“In addition to dollar consolidation and inflation forecasts, there are already a number of signs of adjustment to financial policy,” Jones said.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the return curve is straight, credit risk margins have expanded and volatility has increased. All are typical of the market in which the central bank blackmails policy.
Widely speaking, companies that operate mainly on the US market benefit because the interest rates fall and local products begin to attract.
The outlook for debt-bound multinational companies is weaker, as the strengthening dollar makes their products grow in the global market and the debt rises.
“Histori shows that quality shares are more profitable in the next three months – Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet, after the interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004, lost an average of five per cent.
Companies with a high return on capital and low volatility shares were also better at quality, on average 4 and 3 percentage points better.
There's a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable interest rates lose the most – Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers are generally also benefiting from a dollar increase.
Investors also benefit from higher returns, but experts are not sure how quickly the effects are displayed.
Parliamentary Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticizes the radio station for over-popularization.
According to Bingham, it is now difficult to separate the channel from its commercial competitor.
It also claims that the BBC Music Awards Awards will only be a copy of the Brits Gala.
Mr. Damien Collins, on the other hand, accuses The Voice of Inpersonality.
According to a significant parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 gradually becomes a copy of the Classic FM channel. The charges increase the pressure on the station to prove that they offer other commercial radio stations.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC’s management that the radio channel of the broadcasting company is becoming too populist and is no longer able to distinguish from its commercial competitor.
“I don’t want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to be changing towards the Classic FM channel,” Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards festival held last December also receives criticism from Bingham:
“Last year’s first BBC Music Awards appear to be a copy of the Brits Award.
These two are examples of the fact that, instead of a new and different one, only imitate what is already in the market, Bingham says.
BBC’s CEO denied the allegations and stated that BBC Radio 3’s offer has far more lively music and enlightening content.
“Radio 3 taught me about classical music that I can’t learn from other channels.
The channel’s commitment to live music and music is in its own class.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works.
Earlier this year, the director of BBC Radio 3 Alan Davey said that the station needs to work more hard to keep the audience’s interest because the British know more about classical music.
However, Radio 3 is not the only one who has been critical of entering the territory of commercial channels in consultation with the BBC channel, the limited Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
The Tory Party MP Damien Collins criticized the Voice Skills Competition, which BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media. The price of the trade is estimated at £22 million.
“It’s not much to discuss, because it’s not unique or especially distinctive.
According to Lord Hall, the program presented by BBC1, which, as star judges, is excellent for Palma Faith and Boy George, was produced in a typical way for BBC.
In addition, Collins asked the company to search for a hit program for its own garage, when it next launches a new entertainment series.
However, Collins refused to exclude the fact that the Voice series would continue to be ordered or that taxpayers’ money would be spent on other forms of entertainment.
The growth of online commerce in August – perhaps black Friday
In the first months of 2015, online trade grew by 7 per cent.
The sale of online trade has been statistical since 2000 and in the last month, growth has been the slowest of all time.
The online shop was strengthened three years ago with mobileization.
Experts believe that November’s Black Friday can control shopping desires.
Over ten years of online commerce has been deserted by many of the UK’s shopping wars.
According to experts, there are indications that online trade is on the rise, and the new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slowest throughout the period when the sales of online trade have been statistical, i.e. since 2000. Last year, the online trade grew by only five per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that online trade is on the rise, and the new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If we compare the growth of last year to the 2000s, it is clear that growth will be balanced over time, IMG’s editor Andy Mulcahy told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, online trade accelerated three years ago when consumers took up mobileization.
“As a result, more and more people were able to buy online, and many of them were able to buy in different environments, even at home.
When mobile shopping is more moderate, growth can be balanced.
Black Friday from America is a phenomenon considered as one of the reasons for slowing growth.
According to experts, the last Friday of November may lead consumers to postpone the purchase decision before the black Friday.
Last year, a five-fold number of online buyers compared to normal made many traders' websites fall.
Experts believe that the black Friday, which makes consumers look after the offers, can curb shopping requests during the rest of the time.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a fair pound of each of five pounds per pound was consumed online.
More than a third of certain products, such as television and washing machines, are purchased from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes instead of online shopping fashion.
The Meka is buried in crane accidents for the victims, the Bin Laden family responsible
Muslims carried 29 victims' bodies on the streets when the first funerals were held in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia says the major construction company Saudi Binladin Group is part of the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured after the crane fell.
The bodies were carried in high air when Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the crane that fell on Mekka's Great Moss.
The streets were gathered in a number of white-dressed people to say goodbye to the victims on their last trip to the cemetery of Al-Moaisem.
The sad thing was going to the pilgrimage, where the fallen building designer had only been penetrated through the roof of the mosque a day earlier on the Muslims.
The king of Saudi Arabia calls for a family company in the Bin Laden building industry to be responsible for an accident in which 394 people were injured.
In Mecca’s Great Moskei crane accident, the bodies of 29 dead victims were transported on the streets.
Among the dead that had fallen, the Qasim Akram, from Bolton, was the Great Manchester, who had traveled to Mecca with his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been with his parents in the Great Moskeja, who were starting their annual break-in holiday journey.
Saudi Arabia's authorities have pledged to take place when thousands of people arrive in the city for pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, Binladin Group should not have left the crane booms up when the crane was not used.
According to the Arabic press release, Binladin Group is involved in the accident.
The English-language service of the News Office did not report the matter in detail. However, according to the English-language statement, the management of the group is prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane in the yard of the Great Moskei. Thousands of Muslims are heading the Great Moskeja to the dawn-sacrifice later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published a report on the crane accident and the Group representatives have not been sought for the opinion.
The king also accused the group of not complying with the current safety rules and cooperated with meteorology experts.
The ten cranes surround Mekka’s Great Moskeja as part of the Binlad Group’s giant construction project.
Bin Laden’s family has been in close contact with Saudi Arabia for decades, and Bin Ladens is responsible for several major construction projects.
Al Qaeda’s late leader, Osama bin Laden, was a colonial boy whose family had abandoned in the 1990s.
There was only a few days before the pilgrimage of Mecca, which is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once during life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered the payment of a million litres (i.e. EUR 250 000) to victims’ relatives and permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of the amount of compensation.
According to the B&Q boss, there is a cheap Eastern European workforce behind the phenomenon.
The British are more often hired by home audiences, says Veronique Laury.
The popularity has been increased by skilled workers from Eastern Europe, working as professional practitioners.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores for workers will be opened.
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, main writer, Daily Mail
The British are said to transfer home hammering and painting jobs to those who arrive in Eastern Europe.
Vasarization and painting skills seem to be rare today.
Today, the British are increasingly hiring home generals to take care of their home’s niccarating work, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is a new CEO in Kingfisher, who owns a home-repair store chain. According to Laury, the phenomenon is backgroundd by skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at affordable prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for traders. At the same time, 60 B&Q stores are closed.
Laury needs more female labor for B&Q stores, as eight out of ten purchase decisions at the store make a woman.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, it is important to take into account demographic trends, as today, more and more single women are restoring their homes.
\"Our sales staff are still mostly men,\" Laury says.
“We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions make a woman.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.
Laury is one of the five women who are at the forefront of the British FTSE 100 index. He has also reorganized the company’s management team so that male and female leaders are balanced.
Kingfisher is almost the only one in its quality, as 50% of its staff are women, including the CEO and the financial director.
“This was a conscious decision, and the diversity is an important subject for us,” Laury told us.
It has not been difficult to find good women in the management team.
Kingfisher’s half-year operating and sales figures have a fall, although the company has been working hard after the end of the stores.
Kingfisher is responsible for current trends: the company owns Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The government decided to resort to forced legislation to save the country's economy.
The apparent effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other remuneration center organisations began to be forced immediately, and as a result, the country stands on Friday because of the extensive manifestation of workers.
A lot of people think that there is reason too.
Let's ask if it's worth the strike when it's bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people have already reported that they are not going to participate in the demonstration, but are going to work.
This would have been impossible for an old consensus.
Of course, there was nothing on the internet to protest, but openly declaring a wealth of wealth would have been a small human political suicide.
A few tens of thousands of people protest a lot, but it is the cause of thinking.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest of the action of the Ay movement, the harsh solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift of heaven.
When things have seemed to be rolling with their own weight for years, it is now in the associations that will finally be able to defend the rights of the employee, visiblely and properly.
Thus, the government may want to enforce the role of the Ay movement, when membership in the Trade Union is perhaps seen as more necessary than ever.
We are committed to any action by organizations, so it is a fool that the expression of Friday would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped for a long time.
For example, industrial production has fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
I think these things would force everyone's head.
For the University of Lappeenranta, a heavy savings economy: Objective 8.5 million savings, staff reduction in 130
The technical University of Lappeenranta will start a savings course aimed at reducing expenses by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the University will start the yt-consumption of the entire staff with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means reducing around 130 employees.
In addition, two million other activities are being saved.
The 2016 budget is based on the YT negotiations, which anticipates the actual operation to be 8.5 million deficits.
This will also be affected by the cuts in the budget made by the government.
During this financial period, the University will make about 2.6 million deficit results.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the financing from the Ministry will be reduced by 2 million euros and other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The total budget of the university is around 85 million euros, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between mass teaching and research cuts and the reduction of corporate funding to our university is very important, says Director Anneli Pauli in a statement from the University.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but the reduction in the additional funding now appears in the new scales.
Negotiations with the Trustees will be launched next week on Tuesday and will last six weeks prescribed by law.
Yle: Happybus wants Finnish railways
The owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the UK’s largest railway companies, Souter says.
Rail traffic should be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is the close transport of the capital region in 2017-2018.
After a short journey, there is a long-distance traffic.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the plans of Onnibus are welcomed.
Other international companies have reported their interest in rail transport at least Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus traffic in Finland and rail traffic in other parts of Europe.
Time of the US Central Bank’s interest rate decision
The whole world will follow the U.S. Central Bank Fed meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on the possible raise of interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
A fair half of the economists, who still believed the central bank would raise interest rates last week, are now betting on the central bank's current 0-0.25% interest rate level. This is apparent from the survey by Reuters 80 economists.
“This is a historical situation, as the central bank has kept the interest rate at zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a significant central bank can raise interest rates from zero levels and thus trigger normalisation of interest rates,\" said Angel Ubide, Senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been relatively good, and the recovery has brought additional dollars on the balance sheet and has accelerated little inflation.
However, the Central Bank cannot ignore a global situation that is not as rosy.
It has called for the market to be prepared for change, but it is also apparent from the opposite.
The decision is to be published on Thursday 20.00 in Central Europe.
Delta State University's shooter left an apology.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning – before shooting a colleague later on the same day – Shannon Lamb wrote a message asking for the first murder and hoping to cancel it, the authorities said Tuesday.
In the Mississippi Gautier at Delta State University, Lamb, who teaches road and social science, called the emergency number at about 10 a.m.
Monday, he said he shot a man.
In an emergency call, Lamb asked the police to go home.
\"I shot my wife last night,\" Lamb said, \"and she also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house, which has no harm to anyone, but who is probably scared.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but the man didn't tell me.
Lamb also did not tell me the motive for shooting.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, a message written by the body and Lamb, saying, “I’m very sorry and hope that I could cancel my actions.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me.
The message was written by Lamb, running 500 kilometers to Delta State University, where he killed Professor Ethan Schmidt of History before he took his own life on a late Monday when the police caught him.
Professor William LaForge of the University said that he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that Lamb was clearly troubled by something.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb believed that Prentiss was also in a romantic relationship with Schmidt. However, on Tuesday, the authorities announced that there was no information or evidence about the triangle.
Shawn O'Ste, married to Prentiss for seven years, described his wife as a good person.
The couple had divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen told me he and Prentis have a 19-year-old daughter who's shocked.
The husband said that her daughter and mother were best friends.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of Prentiss Lindsay Knowles told me that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles said Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog named Lightning.
\"He always wanted to help others,\" Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called the relatives during Monday and told them that she was not going to go to prison.
When the police hit Lamb's Highway 1 on the same night near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, fled the foot, ran into the forest and took his own life.
According to the university’s CV on the website, Lamb received a doctoral degree in education at Delta State University in spring 2015.
dimmed stars
The last few years have been heavy for the actor (pictured with his son Redmond).
In 2001, he fought against leukaemia, and in 2009, his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything has really been demanding its taxes.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw page months because of two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg broke in Manchester United's Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The advocate is sad to stay on the side for at least half a year, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes Shaw will return to the field this season.
Twenty-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV defense zone in the bad coat of Hector Moreno when the game was running for fifteen minutes.
Shaw got the first aid in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
\"Shaw has two fractures on his feet, and he's in hospital,\" Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be moved to Manchester tomorrow or the next morning for surgery.
The young man who joined Manchester United at the age of 18 has experienced hardship and is now injured after the great games.
In the costume box, Shaw was given oxygen.
The man cried.
I'm not a doctor, but when the leg breaks down from two points, he's on the side for half a month and he's not playing in the block.
I hope he can still play this season.
Moreno seemed to be able to get away with a little when the situation did not follow the red card of the penalty kick.
The judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
“You decided on your own, but I think the situation was worth the penalty kick and the red card.
It was a two-legged carpet.
Shaw's reference is like this: \"Thanks for all your messages. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. My recovery begins here and I'm getting back stronger.\"
More about Manchester United Luke Shaw in PSV
The British defender has a special reason to recover to compete in the European Championships in France in June.
“This is a very bad injury,” the PSV coach said.
In these cases of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
The goal of players is never to harm the opponent.
Moreno broke his leg when playing in the Mexican lines of Van Gaal's bulleted Netherlands until 2014 in the World Championships.
“He’s very sorry, because his goal was not to harm the opponent. It’s sad to hear that the injury is serious,” Cocu said.
“I didn’t see the situation.
All I saw was a ball that was going in the other direction, so it seemed like he (Moreno) was about the ball, but I didn't see Luke's coat.
“I know how it feels, and I know how difficult this situation can be,” said Moreno to the SBS6 channel.
I feel really bad, I'm very sorry.
PSV Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smodelg.
David Cameron should know Lorax better
Each parent will notice before long that the child will learn his favorite book almost outside.
Except for seeing David Cameron.
When the children’s holiday organization asked Cameron to name his favorite children’s books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, the teaching environmental story of Dr. Seuss, published in 1971.
In a text published on the SuperCamp website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. “Tarina is fun, touching and creative, and has a powerful message. I am happy to read it to my children because there is always a picture or message that we have never noticed before.
It sounds good, except that the next point in which Cameron is to describe a book plot is the 2012 film version summary, which added new characters and details to complement the short initial text.
“In the city of Tarville, where the right trees and plants have disappeared and even the air is a commodity, there is a son named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey by carrying out this greatest dream: to see the right tree, the text tells. In 1991, the dead Dr. Seuss, or Theodor Seuss Geesel, had no passion for Ted.
If this isn’t yet enough suspicious, Cameron’s text is partly connected with the Lorax film’s plot summary on Internet Movie Database. It begins with: “In the city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even the air is commercial, there is a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey.
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the book's plot would be so foreign to him. Ahne Kerskanen destroys the trees and prepares them for the need for the name-posting of Lorax despite the resistance. Lorax is a small and thick, figlike creature that protects the forests.
It is likely that a little of this type of practitioner is believed to be an assistant, apparently someone who, as a child, has not read Lorax 20 times in a pipe.
The Prime Minister said that the text was probably from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps did not comment on the matter in more detail, but confirmed that the text was in the hands of Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being away from the British team, but it's still tough.
The meeting of Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but we are not expected to repeat the last 3-0-Test-series loss of the team selected for the tour of England.
I wouldn't close the chance of a guest win.
Alastair Cook's side can be more experienced than a three-year-old team, but the team has good players and the team's attitude is strong – they have no bad experience in 2012, only youthful positiveness.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a tour eater, and Adil Rashid, although he does not have a test-level experience, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the English Test team and replaced with Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is obviously difficult for me to understand as his chief coach in Yorkshire.
His seven tests have been against two good attacks in challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that the critics are appreciated according to the results.
Joe Root, for example, is not a questionable choice because, as I have said before, players are the best choice.
A few 50-point match would have been on Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hit Yorkshire with more runs.
England’s head coach Trevor Bayliss also praised his attitude when he did not succeed as well as he could, which does not surprise me. He is, above all, a team player.
The question of how long the Test shooter gets the opportunity to make his own impression is difficult.
Lyth received seven ground matches – like his predecessor Sam Robson – while Nick Compton received nine.
Only Compton was given a chance in both home and guest games.
The only point of appeal is that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in top shape – but this past opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales comes to the team and he's a hitter I appreciate high.
He's an unknown author's Cricketer we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he made 236 points against us on Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea is that Mooen will start the draw with Cook, which will give an extra spin-eater to the game while holding four fast-eaters, and I will not be against the idea.
I don’t see a barrier to the fact that a top eater could be in here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great Cricket player.
Moeen may not have had much in his local team in Worcestershire, but he has been a team trio player and is not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test games as the first replacement player before starting in 2001.
He immediately made three hundred points, and there was no return.
Zafar Ansari has proved to be a very impressive young man in the team, based on what I’ve seen of him.
People can look at his statistics – an average of 31 points as a hitter and 35 as a pitcher – and this can be a knockout, but a lot of spinsters have not shown themselves ready, and voters decided to take a young player.
He learns a lot during this game trip.
Outside the playing team, English influences the couple of intelligent choices of their training staff.
The appointment of a Sri Lankan hitter, MTC Jayawarden, as the advisor to the Test matches can be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most beautiful men of the species that brings a lot of experience because he has played in all sorts of circumstances and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the white ball of the game trip and brings both energy and mercy.
I think he has always influenced the right international criticism, whether he is a player or coach, and like Mahela, he has a useful intelligence.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it said the same thing before, can be a spraying injection.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one day's games, Root has a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Even though not everyone agrees, coaches and voters do not set a schedule of matches.
And it must be borne in mind that, like players, their job depends on the results.
These decisions will never be taken without consideration.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is at a bad time in 2017
David Cameron's semi-renewal strategy for the UK to stay in the EU is still in a deeper vein from day to day, even without a pleasant Jeremy-yes or no, Corbynik's choice to lead the Labour Party or TUC to mock Europe violently on Tuesday.
In other countries, they have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat recently explained how many crises have led to the EU's rypee - although not everyone has their own actions - some of the Member States are tired of the UK's self-righteous agenda, which includes the concessions that cause disagreement and the amendments to the Treaty that they do not really want.
In Brighton, the TUC Annual Congress decided that they would not like to see social security in the EU, even if it undermines social security.
We could call it Dave and George's self-evident agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor breathe at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, capture the picture of themselves in front of the famous monument, with or without high-value people, return home and tell them they have acquired allies for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to have a wide-sighted UK inside the EU TV, doesn’t leave us alone with France, Berlin says and suggests that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capital cities have come to the point of no longer caring whether we will be left or going.
Angela Merkel, the German reasonable Chancellor of the Alliance, is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave office before it is damaged, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitrirand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Holland has a re-election or successor choice in 2017.
His power is falling too.
Poland may soon have a national right-wing government, while in Spain it will be the left-wing government.
It is difficult to imagine them fighting to help selfie Britts who could better use their energy to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom. They do not want to do so, because most of them have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers can plan to intentionally throw useless comments into the Scottish National Party style in the 2017 National Election Campaign of the United Kingdom, which wishes to force the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
“The most recent negotiations were organised – there was nothing left for the UK to renegotiate.
The Europeans know how the British newspaper is preying and how the EU-sceptic oligarchle is, just like Tony Benn’s 1975 referendum, which led to a 2:1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Someone may recall, remotely, Boris Johnson, a knife-like Euro-opportunist, who became known as our EU direct banana correspondence in Brussels at the beginning of the 1990s.
Ed Miliband at least knew his enemy.
They include tax evasion, telephone hacking, and apparent temporary housing that own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same about them, but then realized that when you are in a cage with a rough gorilla, you need to stretch bananas into a spider so that the gorilla wouldn’t eat you for lunch or dinner.
Miliband was even more blared by Blair in opposition to the referendum, and Blair admitted to the EU constitution, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in referendum 2005, Blair was able to make a good decision.
The press never forgiven him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn who kindly killed me on the Westminster Monday. I told him he no longer had time to waste on me. It could be a danger that he would introduce Neil Kinnock's media boycott strategy from the 80s. It was a mistake and still is.
It may take some time, but Corbyn has to develop a coherent strategy for dating the media. Not with me, but Andrew Marrin, who was sitting on a BBC couch on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyn in Europe is what we politely call constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most people outside of Ukip and Tory are likely to respond positively to this.
That's what Hilary-Benn, but not Bennite, Benn said on radio and television this week, when his inner son of patrol tried not to admit that Corbyn was a bad bet to call the Karski John McDonnell as the shadow state minister.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his old father had difficulty being on television with his unspeakable Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his place in the lower room.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Benn said he was opposed to staying in the EU under all circumstances – McDonnel did not say that to his colleagues and under-room members in the private meeting on Monday night.
The desire for Corby to convey any wonder of the picture, it must be remembered that he even touched me. The visitor is important during the 24/7 season, especially in the discipline of social media, where paranoid and fraud can be overcome.
Cameron does not need to give a free pass to the EU, which would allow him to keep Labour’s support self-examined in the referendum, as McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins, at least, believes that.
McDonnel and Corbyn's equacation on EU membership is suitable for the island economy and the past against capitalism. The discussions are no longer just a small circle of left-wing dissidents who have the idea of combining similarity with the idea of being a key element of doctrine in the doctrineal horrors.
The equation has also been seen in NATO. Tom Watson is unconvinced that Corby does not campaign for departure. Foreign diplomats have to try to clarify this issue to their home countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have suspicious voters. Why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the bad military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even during the operations of the Tory Government. I got a reminder of it on Monday during the British Influence Security Forum launch.
Experts criticized the British authorities’ opinions on electric cigarettes
According to the researchers, the state-funded institution’s claims that the combustion of electric cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking were born at a meeting with 12 participants linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticized the evidence provided by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal in the Public Health England (PHE) report on electric cigarettes.
PHE described his report published last month as a translation and a comprehensive review of the results.
However, many researchers have questioned the certainty of data and highlighted the links between some experts in the tobacco industry.
Lancet Medical Journal’s main article was taken in the last month by the very bright foundation of the teeth, which is based on the main conclusion of the PHE.
In addition, two researchers have considered in BMJ whether the claims were set up on a \"college or sand\".
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine European Public Health Professor Martin McKee and Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool Simon Capewell have stated: “The basic assumption of public health is that the principles of action are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness.
According to McKeen and Capewell, a large audience assumes that the PHE’s claim that, according to the most recent assessment, electric cigarettes are approximately 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes should be based on detailed research results analysis and modelling.
The claim is based on one meeting of 12 people, which was invited together to develop a model based on a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The model wanted to bring together the views of participants on the disadvantages of nicotine products. The results were compiled in the study.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the meeting’s supporters included EuroSwiss Health, whose former independent research has been funded by British American Tobacco (BAT).
In addition, in a report on sustainable activities, the CEO expressed support for the activities of BAT in accordance with public health.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting granted funding from the electric acid manufacturer. However, the previous financing from the tobacco company Philip Morris International did not grant that participant.
There is no explanation of the selection criteria for panel configuration, but there are several well-known supporters of electric cigarettes, some of which are granted their involvement as an industrial financier.
However, some of the participants are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE tobacco port.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the group’s research report shows that there is no undisputed evidence of the harmfulness of the products, with a wide range of products and their criteria being met.
However, there are no links or shortcomings in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, no evidence has been provided so far that electric cigarettes can promote smoking in children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, the director responsible for the health and well-being of PHE, the claims have been answered before.
According to Fenton, electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every other person who smokes through life dies because of tobacco addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electric cigarettes are lower than the risks of conventional tobacco, however, long-term effects need to be examined more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens of what evidence shows and what it does not indicate, especially in a situation where the relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the UK, there are almost 80,000 cases of smoking deaths annually, and smoking costs two billion pounds per year for public health care.
Responsible action requires that we clearly present the current screen, according to which electric cigarettes are not a risk-free alternative, but the disadvantages they cause are a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss
Luke Johnson, head of Channel 4, has stated that BBC should stop sending certain programs. These include EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hand over the hit bars, such as the soap series Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the license fee should only be used for programs that other television stations do not do.
He criticizes the BBC for the presentation of programmes that are likely to reach a smaller audience at the same time as the competitions’ major audience programmes, as well as the BBC4 channel.
When Tony Hall, CEO of BBC, announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said he tried to get Channel 4 in cooperation with BBC for six years, without results.
“I don’t agree with the idea that BBC buys formulas and sends programs that would clearly belong to some competing channel software,” Johnson told the House’s Committee on Communications, which identified the future of BBC.
If BBC wants to keep a public broadcasting fee, which I think is not necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should reduce its supply to at least programs that are not produced and purchased by others.
BBC sends The Voice to the best viewing time because it wants the widest possible support in the future.
If no other channel is concerned with the program, it is clearly ridiculous nonsense.
“I don’t understand why the regressive tax should finance programmes that could be financed without subsidies,” Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders is another, even though it is its own production.
Many channels would give their right hand over it.
I don’t understand how this serves the service of the broadcasting company.
I don't think these would be a loss to BBC.
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur in Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010. In his opinion, BBC has tried for good audiences because the company is working for ambitious people and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson’s comments on the BBC’s most popular series are similar to the former Sky-Point Tony Ball, who proposed in 2003 with his MacTagger lecture that BBC would sell out series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the BBC’s niche programs are displayed on BBC4 channel, where viewers can most often not measure, but programs meet their goals.
“BBC presents them as times when no one will ever see them.”
Johnson said: “I’ll find you in the same old-fashioned system that will benefit you best.
Everyone, of course, thinks that £150 per year is cheap, but the people to whom it is a big sum, especially if BBC isn’t exactly looking at.
Former Sky and Channel 5 channel manager David Elstein, who also stated his views in committee on Tuesday, said that BBC should exchange its ancient missions with new data, learn and entertain.
According to Elstein, BBC’s current offer hardly has educational programs – 1 percent on television and 0.1% on radio. He adds that BBC should learn from Australian and Canadian public radio companies and repress its mission to a new belief: “information, lighting and entertaining –
The question of cooperation with Elstein suggests that BBC could add shipments, for example, to events such as the Proms Festival, whose concerts were sent only a fraction last year.
Brain cells can be controlled with sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how to switch in the direction when they are exposed to ultrasound.
Scientists have grown worms whose nervous system has been genetically altered, thus controlling worms with ultrasound.
Small socks change in their direction when directed to ultrasonics with a frequency above the hearing area of the ear of man.
Sound waves activate motion nerve cells that are genetically modified in such a way that they have a transport membrane that reacts to ultrasound.
More about: Researchers monitor brain activity through light
According to researchers, worms were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new sonogenetics method (dubbed sonogenetics). In the process, ultrasound is utilized to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with an irritant from outside the body.
Researcher of Salk Instute in California, Sreekanth Chalasani, told Guardian that the method could one day replace deep-brain stimulation (DBS). DBS treatment is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson’s disease symptoms in which the brain is stimulated with electrical pulses.
Succolamas do not normally react to ultrasound. Chalasani noticed that the worms, however, begin to react when placed in a liquid with microscopic small bubbles.
According to Chalasan, bubbles strengthen ultrasonic waves that advance in worms.
Enhanced ultrasound waves affect TRP4 ion sinks, which are part of worm cell membranes.
According to an article published in Nature Communications, the sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
In order to control the shuttles with ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that I know of the nerves that guided their movement appeared in TRP4 ions.
When ultrasonic was directed to the modified worms, the microcubes strengthened the sound waves and moved to the worms, when the nerve cell launched a signal.
The method resembles a little optogenics, which is a transforming tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells through light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics have certain benefits compared to optogenics.
The light is directed to the brain that is subject to the study, using light fibers. The low-density ultrasounds instead penetrate the cell easily, so the ultrasound can be redirected to the brain through the skull.
“We believe that gene therapy and viral therapy can temporarily expose the human nerve cells to ultrasonic signals in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment,” Chalasani said.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and in insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture tools – on your home door!
Advertisers are a disgrace to the British Armed Trade
Look at Amnesty International's anti-armed trade video.
Cracking killer missiles!
Neckbreaking foot rails!
Rhypoms!
Remote magnets that cause unbearable pain but do not leave traces!
A happy voice and drawings clearly reveal that this advertisement of the world's largest art fair is a parody. The video is produced by Amnesty International, and its aim is to highlight the British administration's attempt to sell weapons to the sorting governments at the security and defence-related DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) fair, which will be held at the ExCel exhibition in the Docklands, London.

Bus stops and subways also feature posters that require another look.
“Excellent notice: Do you move on the metro from 15 to 8 August – The notification resembles the announcements of the London metro. At the distance of the Metroline, there is a picture of the tanker.
“In September, a group of arms dealers arrive at Docklands. Customers are asked for help to stop the weapons fair.
Three hundred posters have been created by artists who were present at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped to distribute posters around London with a six-poundd advertising box with hexacolo keys that claim to have access to about a third of the world’s bus stops.
Transport for London is not a poster of vandalism.
One of the special Patrol Group collections.
According to the curator of Cruel Designs and the lecturer at the University of Essex, the artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political work to the public to see outside the galleries.
Artists have found that social influence through art requires art to be brought into the real world. Many people are going to work with Protestant activists.
One of the anti-arms posters greeted public transport users in the metro.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed through Facebook more than 100,000 times a day. It has been designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both graphic designers and drivers have also done their job without compensation.
Matt Lever, the artistic director of VCCP, was insolent with the absence of mass advertising and an empty encounter in the ExCeL event calendar. He said: “Let’s give them a campaign they’re trying to avoid.
They tried to get a more realistic, cloudy business video, but bright colors and animation are more noticeable.
“They’ve done a great job and helped us raise up the fairs that practice illegal torture,” said Amnesty Tom Davies.
“This government must take action and ensure that the instruments of torture are not lawfully traded at our home door.
However, the most creative antia of the gun fairs may be presented in the exhibition halls in ExCeL, where the exhibitors take advantage of huge circular expressions of their merchandise.
In his press release, Saab announced an order made by the U.S. Army regarding the \"portable AT4CS RS\".
The product includes a “specially shaped warhead, which effectively penetrates directly into the destination.”
It doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Student Housing
I moved to the student residence 11 years ago. I was innocent 19 years old and still believed in barettes and moral relativisms. Only now I remember the crowd of smiles I was annoying, and countless, long complaints I remember.
The most important teachings can be summed up to eight simple rules.
The move to the apartment is the most painful experience and the worst is shocking.
In this situation, you will easily start preaching: tell everyone where you are, whether you like the middle year, and why you like Corbyn and why you don’t “right hate” or love Marmite, because it’s just a ginger, a hakhaha, I’m in my room.
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask other things.
The question will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like and the people you wouldn’t talk to even when your eyelashes were in the manifestations and these people would share evaporators.
Give the others room.
The rooms often work as drinks, movie theatres and public residences, but their own room is also a place to dress up from underwear.
More about: Don’t even imagine connecting with each other and university studies
Introvertes University is a hard place
The private room should be a place of calming down. However, many apartments form a social culture that walks from one room to another and forms life-long friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a return place.
In this environment, it is not possible to say: “I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can recharge the energy I used to date you.
Try to find out if someone from your study friends is exhausted for social interaction. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a textian instead.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
In my own student apartment, there was a guy who thought the locked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw all sorts of things.
Get some friends by bake.
You start your study properly when baking is in, so if you brows and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50-century, a little weird case: \"We're welcome to the neighborhood, I bake you something small. Smile when I get out of your personality.\"
Homemade treats are a great way to make new friends.
Your fellow students are forced to talk to you, thanks to a pleasant surprise, they can be left with a positive picture of you.
This, of course, requires you to have reasonable bakery skills.
If you serve bad flour, sugar and fat-fed cooks, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Cooking is also a common defect in student housing.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but can you pour your tea from someone else's milk can?
Always make sure you have the milk cane owner.
You'll probably get permission, even if your milk loan is the owner of a jar.
I understand very well that it is annoying if someone is going to talk to you about something, but try to take care of the situation as adultly as possible – unlike my own study partner, who put the detergent in his milk as a punishment for milk thieves.
She's in prison now.
Do not meditate when others try to sleep or push.
Not just because it's polite, it's worth remembering that everyone else's hole digs...
In my own apartment, a girl asked the living room next door to adjust the sky of music to a smaller one, for it was three in the morning, and she had a exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When I was finally quiet in the neighborhood, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours, and she left for three hours for the exam, left the music to hang out in her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband moved to the same apartment?
And wouldn't it be weird if you thought first that your fellow student is your future spouse, you would start dating, divorce and have to see him every day and lose the right to meet your friends?
The heart, of course, wants what it wants, and if the student isn’t absolutely the only right one, try to control it.
If you notice at the moment that someone has forgotten their key to a room whose door has not been locked, the limit of fucking and bullying is more subtle than you could think.
A good joke is fun, but one that will recover in a moment.
Hideing something can be a valuable and fun teaching, but no one's room should be confused with a toothpaste and a shampoo.
The door of another room can be locked and dropped into the glass of water, which is placed in the freezer, but do not attach anyone’s goods to the ceiling with a blue bar a few times more.
Racist impact on the residence of foreign students in Kite - The house planned as reception centre was crushed in Salo
A racist attack on Kite in northern Karelia was made on Saturday morning.
Unlike the police said earlier, it is not the accommodation of minor asylum seekers, but the sleeping rooms of foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer time, says the teacher Heidi Lukkainen of the Kiteen Evangelical People’s University.
The windows and walls of the apartments of the National University were crushed with racist marks, such as carvings, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one accommodation, says the police in Eastern Finland.
According to Luke, as the responsible teacher of the youth’s social guarantee education, there were approximately ten people in the building that was targeted by the outrage.
“While the weekend and adult people are free to move, some might have been elsewhere,” Luke says.
There are 12 people from 12 different nationalities in the National University.
They are already students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All those in the battle building have a status.
Some study in adult education, some are in vocational studies and some study in Finland,\" Luke says.
A status is a so-called permanent residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The Eastern Finnish police investigates the attack as a damage and a violation of home peace.
According to Luke, the students were held a press conference on Monday, with the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic around here, and no one wants to leave.
We've had more than a decade of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this happens,\" Luke says.
Luke said the mess was already cleaned out of the walls.
As a contractor, there were at least three men, and they had been on the move with a light passenger car.
I think this is the main highlight of the young weekend when this topic has been on the surface.
Nothing more serious, Luke says.
Salo also has a hospital in which a reception centre has been designed.
The incident happened last week.
It was announced on the MTV website on Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was painted as a hakarist and written in English, “You are not welcome.”
It's been reported to the police.
Amendment 15.9. at 16.02 The incorrect information provided by the police on the age and status of the persons living in the building.
The state will end the Y train to Karjaa - passengers in their chewing gums,
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepor will cease to run in March.
The news alarmed passengers on the main train station in Helsinki that started the train at the beginning of the evening.
In particular, the slope strikes the Siuntiolas, said Torbjörn Bengtström, a municipality resident in the municipality.
It's idiotic, because the number of residents is growing all the time and the working hours need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be up to anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says the HSTV interview video will be coming to the capital of the tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in the Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main track are combined into a new R line.
Purola's position in Järvenpää and Nupplinna in Tuusula are not used.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published on Tuesday information on what route the Ministry of Transport purchased during the next contractual period.
The contract period varies from year to year and the end of routes is in the whole country.
The new four-year agreement to be concluded in autumn will be approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Siuntiolainen Bengtström believes that the state train stoper is a short-sighted operation.
We make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there will be repentance.
The Y train is also used by non-raaseporians and Zionists, because it is fast and bypasss several stations.
On the train, the Espoon Annina Pöyry was plagued by the fate of travelers from the city area.
“It’s especially bad for those who have to redesign their journey,” he said when he was on the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
A new train connection will probably be coming to the beach, which will replace the Y train in the area of the Helsinki Region (HSL), i.e. to the Churchnumme.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities and their taxpayers.
“We’re starting to find out different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices,” said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate the costs.
Rihtniemi says that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y-train in about a million years, the Ministry has paid a lot more than that.
The R line on the main track skips two positions.
On the other hand, the number of trains in Ainola and Saunakallio doubles.
The whole country ceases to have 28 small positions and numerous routes.
The Ministry will no longer buy train traffic from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keurou and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinajoki.
The Piesämäki Route is shortened to the Piesämäki Route.
Trains are reduced by Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips per year are made on permanent journeys, with a total of around nine million trips in transport purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring 12.3 million annual savings to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book on the state of the capital: \"It is worth studying in Marx.\"
The crises in the world economy have raised the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his final work published in 1867-1894 on the capital of the capital, writing in the book of the capital of Marx, published today by Yrjö Hakanen as the former president of GDP.
\"He will now be taken more seriously than in a long time,\" Hakanen writes in his speech.
Marx's estimates of capitalist economic development, internationalisation and intrusion in all areas of life, concentration of capital and the growing role of capital and imaginative capital have proved to be amazingly distant.
In the list of books based on the mainoma seminars organised by Hakasen, a professor of Aalto University can also be found at Sixten Korkman, a respected economist.
In the book, Korkman writes Marx's being current and eternal.
However, it is not Marxian, the former CEO of the Institute for Economic Studies and the Organisation for Economic Development, is it?
Not at all.
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not consider Marx as a current economic thinker, but rather as an interesting social theory.
Today, social sciences are distinguished and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and a class of literature.
“The common idea is that the athetic history tells us about the false opinions of the dead men,” Korkman begins.
The truth is, Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions from the beginning of capitalism too far, Korkman thinks.
But Korkman sees the value of Marx’s radical attitude.
“The most relevant question in Marx is that he asked good questions,” he says.
We are talking about Marx’s interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
“Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture, as a result of the changing world as a result of the technical bubble,” Korkma analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not helping Marx.
In his opinion, capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
However, in Marx, Korkman thinks he should be familiar.
“In the 1970s Marx could not be read,” Korkman said.
“Males and Trotskys and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more each other.
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also approach without the ideological and political weight of the years back.
“Every social scientist should get to know Marx’s world of thought, like other classes,” Korkman said.
The UN calls on war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for a special court to investigate war crimes in the Sri Lanka Civil War, AFP says.
The UN report on the Civil War in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both Sri Lanka's armed forces and the rebels known as Tamil soldiers.
The Sri Lanka Civil War estimates that at least 100,000 people died.
There is no accurate information on the number of victims.
In particular, in the last months of the long war, the major attack of the armed forces should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
Sri Lanka's military report accuses of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have committed the forced use of bystanders and children as fighters.
Both sides have been murdered according to the report.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to organise the investigation itself, but it is not going to allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice, as foreign judges.
England’s Yo-Test allowed to weigh social media
In the autumn student books, there was a long foreign language that most of them had English on Wednesday.
He tested his English skills from over 16,000 experiments.
In the experiment, it could be written about social media.
Based on its own experience, it was necessary to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the English-speaking 150-250 words could be shown to the web page’s advisor.
The title was Dear Agony.
Agony Aunt is responsible for the Finnish Lithuanian resting chair.
He had to ask how parents should look at things from the point of view of young people.
There were four subjects that had to be chosen.
“It was the hardest of them, the third subject of the Swedish-language journal Mia Lybeck, who studied Porvoo’s Swedish-language high school.
The third issue was just a sitat from the former President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth subject, according to Lybeck, was very nice.
He had to write a fire speech about why businesses should hire young people to work.
“At least in our school, we have been trained to write speeches,” Lybeck says and estimates the whole experiment as normal.
In Finnish - or Swedish - an English experiment, questions were answered about texts that, for example, included the adaptation of the summer campus to climate change and the processing of large amounts of information.
On Wednesday, some long Russians were also written (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The articles of the autumn will continue on Friday, when the test of another domestic, Swedish or Finnish.
In the readings, the test is normally carried out, i.e. the expression of the employees does not affect it.
The College Board calls on the pilots to search for suitable transport connections in time so that they can get to the trial.
You can also get more time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
In Oulu, a deal was robbed with a gun.
On Wednesday morning, the store was robbed in the city of Kello.
According to the police, the robbers were dressed in dark clothes and the faces were covered with a commandoscope.
The man is normal and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
They're investigating this as a gross robbery.
Police are preparing to join tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support parties from elsewhere in Finland
The government’s anti-circumciating expression of mind will be blocked by the Helsinki Centre on Friday, predicting the police.
According to preliminary data, even tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, A Plan and STKC associations meet at Rautatientor at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The police at work are not only responsible for alarming tasks and other police activities, but also for ensuring the smooth operation of a giant expression.
Roads leading to the railway station are closed from motor vehicles for about 9.30-14.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi traffic is cut off from the district of Kaisaniemi, from the west since Mannerheiming.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
So far, it seems to be enough.
I'm not taking a stand for police struggles.
According to Kujala, the support parties from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki due to the demonstration of mind.
The police won't tell you the exact numbers of patrols.
“Some of us are coming, but in principle, we’ll be fine with our own,” Kujalala says.
The police are calling for private cars to be avoided in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic hub extends from Hakaniemi level to its core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from morning to early evening.
With protesters arriving from other countries in Finland, there are also a lot of order buses coming to Helsinki.
They won't be released to the Railway Station.
Buses are, in principle, distant.
The rest of the journey should then walk to the demonstration,\" Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops Helsinki’s public transport.
From a police point of view, this is a positive side.
The question of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at the hands of these big crowds, is now taking care of itself.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of government opponents of economic policy may be in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the protest to go smoothly.
People are ordinary workers or unemployed – ordinary citizens.
The Finnishs are reasonable and peaceful, says Kujala.
On Friday, local protests are also held in different parts of Finland.
Friday’s expression of mind is exceptional in many ways – do you remember these strikes and expressions of mind?
The great expression of the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good benchmark in Finnish political history, says Martti Siisiinen, Professor of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder the Ay movement protests.
If it didn't, it would raise your hands in front of the government, Siseiinen says.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the Finnish corporate tradition - and also the points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard choices are missing the right to contract.
Here are a lot of features that the Ay movement is actually trying to get to its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, mirrors are needed because the Ay movement does not have the support of all payers for Friday’s demonstrations.
The new one is now the sharp division that the expression of the mind will bring about among the ones that the Ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed people from different parts of Finland expressed their views at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you're looking for a point of comparison for Friday's demonstration, it could be a huge demonstration of the unemployed, the Murrostorstai, held in 1993, says Siisiinen.
In the midst of the deepest recession, the Murrostorstai gathered 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon (centred) government is complicating from the labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and the employees’ organisations had never been as bad as during the Ahon bourgeois government.
Now, between the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than in the days of Murrostorsta.
In addition, it is now the very bourgeois government of Finland, Siisiinen says.
The current government coalition is still interesting in this way that it is so tightly right despite the words of the basic Finnishs.
At the time of the steep, there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected on Friday.
The expression also stops public transport and possibly closes day-care centres and schools.
Although the expression of mind does not receive the indivisible support of the payees, it can become the largest in years.
Around 300 protests have been held in Helsinki every year in recent years.
They're on the edge.
Traditionally, in Finnish ay movement demonstrations, it has been quite peaceful - although the methods of action have been tightened in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish protests avoid conflict, they are law-minded.
The protestors are trying to avoid damage to or destruction of property, Sisian says.
The late 1990s, however, brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration changed.
EU membership irritates farmers to throw eggs and the police prepared to get a pig shit on.
The firemen strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes, among other things, pilots and pilots.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electric ceilings of the 1970s
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were the metal ceiling in 1971 and the power and power ceiling in 1977.
The metal man strike was attended by 70,000 metal men.
The strike was suspended after seven weeks of the strike.
Metalmen received a 16% increase in wages.
In the spring of 1977, the electric ceiling lasted 49 days and caused electric shocks all over the country.
Murrostorist in 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20,000 people met with the Parliamentary House, many of them who were unemployed, and expressed their views on the job.
Firemen striked for three months in 1998.
The firemen strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were forced into egg harvest in the protest of farmers against the EU in 1994.
“Siberia teaches, the EU ends, was one of the slogans.
Spain's farmers had a ton of snow.
The Helsinki EU summit in 1999 also made farmers protest and burn hayballs in front of the meeting.
Nurses striked in 1983 and 1995
Nurses were striked for about a month in 1995.
Last time they were in the strike in 1983.
In 1995, a few deaths occurred during the strike.
The factory threatened with the strike and mass transplants of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass migration was ultimately the result of negotiations.
Doctors were licking in 2001.
“The doctors in the strike - for the escape - included the slogan of the lawmakers in 2001.
The local health centre and hospital physicians’ strike lasted five months and had a lively debate on how the strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students moving in 2013
About 5,000 students march for study support in Helsinki from the Senate Square to the Parliamentary House in 2013.
Central Crime Police to find out the backgrounds of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Crime Police to investigate the backgrounds of the refugee stock registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped in Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
There is no information on whether the truck might have been on its way to Finland.
They were all in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
Research and main responsibility are at the event in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of Central Crime Police.
At the end of the film, other refugees travelling by truck in Austria were more likely.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board died apparently by suffocating.
According to the General Radio, which first reported with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to the Finnish company.
The company is engaged in, among other things, restaurant activities and its CEO is a foreign-like, about 40-year-old man.
Two Iraqis have been arrested for human trafficking in Austria.
The refugee's far-reaching captain, the former drug crimer, and the uplifting businessman - the story of the five smugglers
Upporous smuggler king, violent boat driver, a stylish missionary, and a taxi driver holding himself as a good guy.
For example, such people are engaged in human trafficking in the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci at the University of Trenbolone have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their customers, and their book Death Travel Agency will appear in Finland this week.
In the book, they present the lonkers of human smuggling, present the proposals for solutions, and present smugglers from different stages of the business.
The HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna get rid of them right now.
The Kerkenna Islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunishans are heading there for summer entertainment.
For its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as there are only 120 kilometres to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy.
Because of comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives in Emir, the captain in the chain and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their cataracts, but the fisherman is more profitable to carry people.
This was done by Emir on a blue, ten-metre tree, hundreds of times.
If the boat closes, there will be 40 people.
From one trip to Emir earns about 8,000 euros after the cost.
Emir has five assistants looking for her customers all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until again in the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Island in small groups.
Emir places them in empty houses for as long as he sees good.
Food is given to customers just and just stay alive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the client is out of money, it’s their problem.
We're going to leave the water at midnight.
The first night we drive out of the island, then stop, wait for the day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in the 20-meter high waves, passengers cry and vomit.
At the end of the day, the human cargo has been dismantled in half an hour and Emir leaves for a return trip.
Emir wants to be afraid.
That's why he's beating his customers, and at least claiming he's beating up the hangers from the dead.
In the book, he says that once the police hit him, he threw all his passengers over the side and told them to swim to the nearest island.
“I looked at the customers one by one, and I threw them over the side,” says Emir in the book.
The most peaceful travelers come from the south of Sahara.
I'm told he's got to abuse this.
I'm gonna get rid of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
Just a regular taxi driver
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogojisha, Serbia.
His taxi's not very good - the starter's engine lasts, and it's seen its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi is moving above all, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogojisha is a small village of 500 inhabitants, about 60 kilometers from Belgrade to lunch.
Next to the village, the centre for asylum seekers is located, where most families are allowed.
Men who travel without their family are housed in tents, warehouses and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
Families living in the forest who have not submitted asylum applications to Serbia for a reason or for another reason.
Some also live in private homes, but it is a public secret.
From a group of foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted – through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of cross-border crossings and weeks of walking in a difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
In the end, when arriving in the area of Bogojisha, a major human smuggling hub, people are dying.
Goran's Cyticians are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
\"They say their thing once and that's enough,\" Goran said.
According to him, the Africans are trying to do a trick.
Goran doesn't like it.
What a silly nonsense all the way.
First, the price is EUR 300, then they count it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and good-hearted man.
Money doesn't interest me.
I'm just doing my job and helping people, he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than the rest of his and billing rides to the Hungarian border for only 50 euros from a person.
The trip is a quarter of a mile away, most of which are comfortable highways.
I hear colleagues ask for three or four times the price.
Goran deserves about 50,000 euros a year.
It's not a big deal for smugglers, but it's a very nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not carry migrants within 12 kilometers of the Hungarian border.
Goran does not care about it: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his rides to the end of a mile away.
Then he shows his customers the right direction and cheers away.
In the Work of Grace
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a missionary and is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kambala, where there are many refugees from the Congo, as well as a small center to help the Congolese refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Embassy runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the embassy to look good.
He polishes his shoes several times a day and takes care that the white calf of the rubber strips is elegantly under the low waist of the jeans.
The embassy is proud of its new Mercedes, its terrain car and three motorcycles.
When the Messenger does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forwards to Europe.
At first, the customer calls some of the five phone numbers of the Transmitter.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money with a whistling and whispering among the merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain asylum seekers or refugee status to the Ugandan authorities, it must be said that it is home to, for example, the North Kivu war zones, and that violence has been forced to flee from their home.
Often it is true, but if not, the Embassy will arrange a new identity for the customer.
The old identity card will be destroyed and another will be obtained.
This will help the Embassy's contacts with the Ugandan police.
The client will then be redirected to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum search procedure, civil society organisations, in the end the United Nations Refugee Organization (UNHCR).
The embassies know bureaucracy because they themselves have become a refugee in Uganda.
He will charge each port separately: the submission of an application to the Ugandan police will cost about EUR 100, the handling of documents to the humanitarian organisation, and the migration process, for example, to some European countries, EUR 4,500-7,000.
Foliot and ice creams
Tom's a beginner smuggler, a former drug dealer.
The four-year Irish is on the French coast of Calais, where his work is to put people on the road to Britain.
He has an Afghan, French taxi driver, and dozens of truckers living in London who don’t even know he’s in a human secret transport business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near the center of Calais.
They drive the A26 highway and try to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would be forced directly to prison for illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers running over the highway to a resting place where the drivers sleep before continuing to cross the canal to the Britts.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - to make sure it's on his way to England, not even to the Netherlands, and cut the line between the safety vibe of the protective cover.
It needs to be done quietly so that the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved in the plot, but then the wheel is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wrapped his client in a aluminium foil, the same thing that is wrapped in the kitchen around a pastry or oven potato.
It should prevent the police heat scanner from noticeing the hideaway.
Some use the same purpose as ice-filled sleeping bags.
Tom leaves his client's truck, and he's out of town hoping that you wouldn't be driving a shady driver at least before the UK.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçuk is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
Upporish Turks have been called the Master of Marketing and the Undisputed King of Illegal Lands in the Mediterranean, which governs sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, Küçük has been working and has been constantly developing new ways of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only needs the money.
One of the new methods is luxury fishing: Turkish ports are rented to take American or European families for a few days to travel.
In reality, ships are loaded to the precision of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurdishs and Afghans, which are transported from Istanbul to one of the ports and from there to a sea of Europe against a fee of between EUR 5 000 and 7 000.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls until they leave.
People get into minibuses and drive somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When given, you need to get on board quickly.
Passengers must stay under the cover of the entire journey.
The Navy can only observe how deep the ship swims, for no other signs of the human population are visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers get out and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives about EUR 53,000 from one luxury trip after the cost.
He does not take care of practical things himself but hires the captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other smaller factors to handle the work for himself.
During the summer season, transport is held for at least hundreds of years and Küçuk earns millions.
He is believed to have bought land, pharmaceutical company and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçuk was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the Turkish Democratic Party MP and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he must have disappeared.
On 16 September 2015, at 15.10 a.m.: The book of the Death Travel Office will appear this week, not next week.
American Olympics in their book about their illness and becoming a prostitute
Three times in the Olympics, the new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 500-metre runner, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells about the ending of his career and becoming a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published some interruptions from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton decided his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the competitions in top shape and ran in the cartilage for the second best time.
In the final, however, he was panicked.
He immediately rushed to the top and defended his seat on the ground run.
150 meters before the goal, however, his power was exhausted.
He fell on the track surface, and the other competitors bypassed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I pushed myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later, it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from a two-way mood disorder.
His brother, Dan, had done a year before Sydney's race of suicide, and he himself felt huge success scores.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
There was no economic problem, but he was fascinated by the idea of having sex with strangers.
He also said his husband would accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's taxi was 450 euros per hour.
He says he spent the money on his luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations of prostitution was that he also missed the same type of adrenaline tricks as he had been competing in public sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he had a two-way mood disorder.
The double life of the former star runner was revealed at the end of 2012 when the Smoke Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was at 1500 metres in the world's statistical circle at 3.57.40, but remained the last at the Sydney Olympics.
The world champion was delighted when the Union placed the Norwegian ski resort in control of: \"Suchly clear.
Norwegian ski club Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of suitability in the opinion of at least one of its colleagues.
Northug and Norway's ski union have been bending through the last year of the summer and autumn as well as the sports deal.
Although the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been suitable for many world champions and Olympic champions either.
As a result of the dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to close Northug out of the world cup of the coming period.
The decision was thanked by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the union put the ski resort under control.
Thank you for showing me the spine, Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
“We can’t allow an active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the union, he continued.
The dispute between Norway and Northug is about money.
Northug seems to want to be part of the country team so that he can advertise his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that will also take care of future generations, and will not give one athlete to the solos.
At the same time, he reminded me that Northug has given both economic and other privileges for several years.
I know because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that a single athlete has quite different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own release, in which he assured me he wanted to play sports in Norway next season in World Cup, as well as in World Cup and Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won six MM medals in all his career, two of which were gold.
He was involved in the team that won the media gold last winter in Falun.
The Christmas Day of the Painters is also celebrated in the North
On the race day of 25 September, the paces will be held at different restaurants and stores, which have been granted the shield of the Paistin translators.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high-quality food expertise and reduce the threshold of departure to the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that not all high-level restaurants are concentrated in the metropolitan area, but top restaurants checked and categorized by a neutral operator can be found throughout Finland.
The international attention given to the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of thyroid restaurants and organizations.
On the north of the country, the day is held in Vaasa in the restaurants Foundation and Kantarellik.
In Kokkola, the old town restaurant takes part in the race day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has been decided to make the organization one of the most important international events that will take place in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kahahaoki magazine: Appealed to the Chancellor of Justice for the establishment of Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre in the premises of the Kauhava ex-space currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the area is still permanently located in a critical infrastructure of crisis time, which is the use of the Defence Forces and its partner, the Finnish Special Networks Oy.
Kauhakoki says that, according to a private person, the placement of the reception centre in the same building set would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interest in the area and airport of the former Airport, whose impact has also not been investigated when preparing the reception centre.
In the case of Kauhava airport, negotiations have been held over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the outcome of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
This has been discussed, among other things, by Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Deputy Minister of Defence, Mr. Arti Rädy.
The private person tells the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about the principle of the reception centre, but about the fact that the planned place in the former backup area is wrong.
The Kauhava City Government dealt with the reception centre on Monday.
Niinistry: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The administration means that immigrants and those who are here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented on the evening journalists after meeting with the presidents of all parliamentary parties in his seat in Mäntünniemi.
According to the President, concerns about the management of the refugee situation were united with all the participants.
He considers it valuable that the government and opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss confidentially the fundamental issues.
Especially when we face great challenges.
The situation in Syria, as well as in Russia and the United States, can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
It is desirable for dialogue to evolve.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension in the situation in the Baltic Sea.
The NATO issue was also discussed in the debate.
The President did not take a position in the labour market situation.

The Early Education Agency promises to inform the Agency of any changes to the activity tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio calls are one channel among others.
This channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä said to the journalists in the parliament.
The Sipilä did not want to evaluate how often the prime minister’s television and radio calls would become.
According to Sipilä, speech may not always be transmitted in the future with Ylen channels.
If other channels are registered as channels, then let's see.
We're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires television and radio speech for citizens.
This matter, which is now being discussed, is rather complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä found out.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 both in TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Areena.
Spipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s television speech will not tell you more about the government’s inwards.
Is it an effort to take the right to define a public debate more strictly into their own hands and to refuse a public debate on questions?
Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin’s recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to be defined himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things are not related.
I understand that the commercial media is upset about the notification of Sipilä.
It would be weird if the media field didn't respond.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not reported in democracy.
It is the responsibility of media representatives to make clear that politicians’ agendas are not being adopted.
The TV call is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, we should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the extraordinary high expectations set for the speech.
Is there more that we have heard today?
Or can he speak in a different way or in different words or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only the same old one in the promise, you have to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an extraordinary time.
This is a risk if it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be identified as a message from politicians or parliament and government, which will certainly not be in accordance with Ylen’s interest or general policy.
Sipple Door Bet
In the future speech of the Sipilä, it is also important what the prime minister leaves without saying, the media researcher emphasizes.
In the evening, you will have to look closely at where Sipilä is missing and where it is not, says Heikki Kuutti, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
Six said the TV speech is a smart bet from Sipilä, because this is how this can bring up its own view without a ringtone.
This will give the message a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike at a conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The symptom bypasss the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media interprets something wrong about the speech, because precise questions cannot be asked.
The moon says it's very important how Sipilä appears on TV - a drain of sweat, whether the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipi to the father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can do well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government knew something about it, because in this man as if he spoke directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners do regularly.
Very exceptional
A political researcher, Erkka Railo, considers the Prime Minister’s speech to be very extraordinary for the citizens.
He said that it has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
The extraordinary time requires extraordinary means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that this is what the Prime Minister wants to make Finns compassionate to the tensions in front of them.
On Friday, the remuneration organizations will hold protests and strikes against the government's actions.
On Twitter, President of the Left, Paavo Arhinmäki said that Sipilä could speak about the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would allow the speech to be discussed.
The SDP president, Mr Rinne (Sd.), once again announces that he is challenging the Sipilä dialogue.
Now is not the time for monologists.
Six months of election.
You can't hide in the finals, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy was found in Tampere
The boy was in good condition at the time he was found.
The boy’s father updated his Facebook page.
The Internal Finland Police Department will also confirm the issue to the West.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
Father thank you to all the people who have helped in the search.
Thanks for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was divided closer to 15,000 times, which is an amazing balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violence of young people: You can hate it.
The Kurdish freelancer Makwan Amirkhani published a video on Facebook, which appeals specifically to young people with migrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani was forced to speak against young street fights.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and reached his family at the age of five, has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amikhani says he received a message asking to see an Instagram account.
Videos have been downloaded to the account where young people fight extremely violently.
Amikhani says he's disappointed in young people's wildness.
A 26-year-old Amikhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick the ground, sit on the other side, and unwittingly strike any of the consequences of this, when you make such videos, Amirkhani updates.
It’s hard to defend
Some of the young people in the video are immigrants.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos on social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and Finnish youth.
I'm sure you're fighting on the street.
You make it so much harder for many other immigrants to live here in Finland, Turkish Amikhani reminds you.
Amikhani reminds me that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very gross.
A little bit difficult, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be quite a long guest here.
That's a little different way of thanking you for being here, Amikhani says.
Amikhani calls on young people to remember their loved ones.
If they sometimes become the object of some racism, then you will be able to accuse yourself of it.
Now, think about it a couple of times before you go into this, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action gives stakes to racism.
You're gonna make me hate what I don't like myself.
You've got things pretty bad, and with that going, you're not going to cure them, Amirkhani decides.
SAK to put its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter, SAK’s President Lauri Lyly says that the employee organisation will consider its position on Monday on the alternative savings list submitted by STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
On Wednesday, STTK informed the Government of its proposal to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre).
The president of the plan, Mr Fjäder, believes that the Government will accept the proposal if the SAK, STK and the Plan are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest payer organisation SAK will soften its previous position.
Mr Lauri Lyly, president of the SAK, commented on the issue in a small way on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this issue on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is looking for solutions to open the labour market lock, and the position of the law requires the agreements concluded by active parties.
Lyly recalls that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement did not qualify for the SAK.
The Sipilä cut off earlier negotiations on the social agreement when the SAK did not agree to commit to the 5% productivity gap target.
Comment: Big impression is threatening the West - I know it's a little funny to wear fists.
It feels a little funny to wear fists, if you already have a matching paper in your pocket, write Pekka Tiinonen.
The moods vary from side to side in the employee camp.
Is it intended to call the government for annulment or, then, agree with it?
On Monday, the SAK’s all-in-laws broke out the sacred hatred of the government of the Republic.
Finland was threatened to shut down.
The threat spread to the apronists.
The training organisation OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ canceled: no school or kindergarten is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Mr Antti Palola (sd) was the chairman of the STKK organization.
He told the government that he had contacted and prepared the alternative proposal requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centred) for a 5% productivity gap.
The President of the Plan, Sture Fjäder (kok) immediately rushed to announce that his contract paper was already completed.
At first, the SAK office did not belong to the yard.
President Lauri Lylyn (Sd) is difficult to reach out to when allies just on Monday ordered the country to stand on Friday.
Finally, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to address the situation and that the SAK would look for solutions to open the labour market block.
In order to create a joint proposal for wage earners, the SAK should tend to accept the 5% productivity factor as a target.
There is no wonder that Palola STTK has a good relationship with the government of Sipilä.
The right hand of the ball, Jukka vinus, Head of Social Impact of the STTK, previously served as Special Assistant of the Central Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kivinieme.
The fire also described that the government’s ay-sacrifice has been improving all the time.
Accident or not, but Palola's exit took a little clean off from Finland's standers, whose photo of the wedding was Marko Rajainen (sd).
It feels a little funny to wear fists if you already have a matching paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18.00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: \"This cannot be repeated.
Russian President Sergei Naryshkin criticized the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
Russian President Sergei Naryshkin said Mongolia is better than the father of Etyj in Finland.
At the Uran Bator in Mongolia, the Etyj Parliamentary Assembly has launched a session in which Naryshkin gave a wide-ranging comment on the Helsinki July Meeting.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had forced the European Union to enter the meeting - a matter from which the President repeatedly resembles journalists.
In our opinion, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This cannot be repeated, Naryshkin stressed the news agency according to Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only by Finland and the EU, but also by the United States, where his access had been blocked.
Sanctios are a political suicide from the EU, declared by Naryshkin.
Mongolia's Russian delegation got a little complicated, so Naryshkin continued to pick up Finland with praise and praise for Mongolia's specific organisation.
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will go constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leaders of Mongolia understand that parliamentary dialogue does not have to be an obstacle.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok) who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian délegation.
The lock meets the real playoff mirror: \"Matthews tightly –
The killer and the lock will continue today in Hakamets, as both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today at Hakamets there is no real goal party.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to grab a 3-2-way win from KalPa.
The rise was manly, because the last season’s silver group was at its worst two goals of defeat.
The lock on Tuesday was more molly-powerful.
As a guest of the Blues that started as a guarantee, the Raumas saw a round zero point, and the loss rates were also 2-3.
Hard game, paints tight, if any of you play the same game as last year, Lukku shocker Janne Lahti anticipates the settings on the club's pages.
The killing has become quite a playoff button for the Raumas.
In the past two seasons, Tappara has just dropped from the final series of Lukko.
On both floors, the solution has been required to determine the seventh match.
In the last season, Lukk took the series to a chandelier in the fourth game, but Tappara rose on the next three breasts and passed.
There are no major changes in the compositions of groups except for paint foams.
Last night, the cashiers who fought both sides are going to be on the peak today.
With the goal of killing, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and between the Lukku poles, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
View angle: The story is running a terrible play
Toivola, the sports director, wrote a post of non-conforming coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the Rocky film, where he himself played the main part.
The subserviator censored the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a big sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title match.
After thirty years of Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola wrote a breathless ash-motor to Pori.
The nameless and wooden-hand pasta came to everyone as a surprise to the SM-finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tough sub-optors like Rocky.
There was a White Indian, Porin Matt, and Pele Pelto.
In the fall games, the players dyed their heads red and cut the iroques.
Hope became a blonde.
A remarkable TV browser, JP Jalo, called the coach Neumann.
They took the winning silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The author, Toivola, believes that the novelty of this season works in the same way as it was ten years ago.
A man who works as a musician has built a potion for bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been dumping waste in the far end like Rocky pigs at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in some other way than in the field.
Hopela has forgotten that Rocky VI plays the main part in Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi is crucified by the Ironallion Sean Connery.
Rautallio is a leading performer in the Rocky script written by Toivola as a leading character as Connery would have been in the 1976 original work.
There's nothing else in the Iron Hall than a nickname.
The game philosophy of the Ironallion is not part of running and running.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's a different thing to play hard than a pig.
In the last season, the Ässien Garret Stafford coated Tapparan Jere Karjalainen head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautaallio put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have those who deserve it.
I don’t accept such a game and it doesn’t belong to an ass-hot, a hot visit to Rautakallio woke up after the game to the people of Satakunta.
The team of this season is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, policemen, and bullies.
There are no key players at the best game age.
No wonder the head coach has complained of a magician.
How much have you been able to influence the player’s acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the past season affect procurement, and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather limited, Rautakallio responded diplomatically.
Under the surface, you'll be able to do it.
In 1953, Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to the place of Toopola as a sports bomb.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
In the three leagues of the Aces balance period there are as many losses with the goal difference of 1-6.
It would not have been worth writing a copy of the script.
Olga Temone plays the mother of Sipe Santapuki
Olga Temone reveals that if he had met his husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temone is the first time to act in the direction of his husband.
Yes, I'll show my husband's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apulanta's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temosen since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but for the first time Olga is in the direction of Tuuka.
Olga’s role in the early years of Apulanta, you made us a beautiful movie with a drummer Sipe Santappuk’s mother Sirkka.
Sirkka empopus and supports his son, even though this father Risto (which is played by Lorenzo Backmann) is trying to be a voice of reason.
The more I’ve familiarized my true example of Sirikka, the easier to play a role seems to go.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuk for trusting me in the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then, the two of them have approached a lot.
They've met, talked on the phone, and they've been communicating.
The circus has helped a lot.
We have been through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, Sirkka also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be a little colored.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulä would become the largest band in Finland.
In the 1990s there was a recession and a real anchor.
There was quite a small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga says he had heard a lot from Tuuk about this youth before the film plans.
However, parents’ stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from Heinola's evil-looking sciarter known as Tuuka.
Olga was a smart and nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
He could have been a secret lover.
According to Olga, he has worked so much with Tuuka over the past 10 years that the big joint project is not afraid.
Everything has always been super good.
Now the whole production group will go to Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in the East is often planning to drive home for the night because of their little children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the whole month of Heinola.
They have taken us very warmly, asking us which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 was the most expensive film in Finland.
Iron Sky, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
The photos begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola starts filming Iron Sky 2 in October Belgium.
The sequel of Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will be the most expensive play film ever in Finland with a budget of 17 million euros.
In the past, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on the Big Gam of the Jalmari Helander.
The Angry Birds animation in the works will also rise after graduation by Iron Sky 2, as the film’s budget is over €100 million.
The films directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa begin in October near Antwerp in AED Studios premises and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
There's no fear of a waste budget.
I've been a sick man!
I have such a relaxed script because I know exactly what kind of movie should be like.
Everyone in the team seems to realize that something is being done unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, she's telling the magazine.
Originally, the film had a budget of 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
The budget is big, but it's a big story.
However, 100 million people should be stuck in the film because each image and performance are so expensive.
Now everything is so tight that there is no finding.
Today, Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a crowd loan to pay a 4-8% annual rate.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and offer during the campaign.
In the last two years, the company will pay the loan back.
The film shows, among other things, Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trenders’ breasts have recently been decorated by big logos.
Even a while ago, a fashionable dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocsja.
Advertising a hood or a T-shirt mark was seen as a train.
But times change.
Sport has become the real megatrend of fashion, and so have the old, familiar sports fashion characters such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the wave of coolness.
And, as often as before, the limit of funny and trendy is to be kept: if something is already right, it starts to become iron and cool.
First came the norm of the core trend, i.e. the tavis fashion, where trends were surprised by favoring as boring basic clothes as possible as a means of separation from mass.
Now, instead of the grey basic college, it’s already the net shirt buried on the bottom of the cabinet, in front of which the manufacturer’s logo is shown.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas’ recognizable track nets, the favorite team’s gaming shirts and the New York Yankees flags have made a return to the street fashion.
The edge of the jeans begins to mock the beginners Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the breast of Versace’s warts makes it clear which sign of clothing it is about.
Would you be willing to present logos in your dress?
The Russian politician released the evidence: I didn’t get stuck in the tank’s hatch!
According to the claims, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo, the Russian military industry products were held in 2015.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colourful claims that the Russian Emergency Ministry had to remove large sizes of Zotovia from the tank hatch for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published on his own public Facebook page a picture where he seems to be cursing a armored vehicle in very good moods, and at least because of these images, it is not about being stuck or angry.
Full of nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't enter the battle tank, but it was a hit-and-run BMP-3.
I am a former soldier, Colonel, I have served in Ural.
I went in there, looked around and came out peacefully, and Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I didn't really spend five hours in that position, he said.
At the Russian military television channel, Zotov explained in the exhibition that he was looking for a new Russian technology, because he is a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagons, and I wanted our technology.
And I came out through the back door, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next show, I will definitely visit all tanks and all attack tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called for the stupidity of the journalist who wrote it.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm long and ratty, but nothing like being stuck in a tank didn't happen, he said to Russkaja sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words support the fact that no photograph of the alleged Jews has been published, although there were a total of 50,000 people in the gun show in a few days.
The claim of Zotov's invading began with the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotov was told to pull out of the tank hatch when he tried and threatened to shoot all those around him, unless he got out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a sequel in which the exhibition organizers reported their views about what happened.
Everyone is just used to the fact that soldiers quickly jump out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, due to his big size, simply delayed when he came out.
But he never sat in it for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski to the Blocks.

Aggnico Eagle Finland’s Kittilän mine has been leaked.
The refined process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sandfall to the stream.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the leak.
The pool has a foam process of neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water.
In general, water is pumped for re-use as process water or, in accordance with the permit, is sent through the surface rolling field to the environment.
The year was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other substance was poured into the environment.
The year was observed during the inspection round on Monday morning.
There has been no structural damage to the dam's dam structures.
The company will cooperate closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred regular workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the International Monetary Fund follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation put forward structural reforms covering Finland in order to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overwork compensation and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contractual system and for unemployment protection.
Danske Bank’s main economist Pasi Kuoppamäki said structural reforms would agree, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a great deal of compassionate communication to the government, but there is also a warning about what should not be cut too much.
For example, infrastructure investments, Kuopamäki says to Economics.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects Finland to have 0.4% economic growth this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Today, Danske predicts that growth will remain zero in its new economic forecast this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have been the basis for the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production was in the summer of small growth, says Kuopamäki.
Less attention may have been paid to reduced confidence in industry or to other so-called softer meters.
However, there are only a few percent of the decimals.
Nintendo, who recovers from death, appointed a new leader.
In July, Tatusami Kimishima, a cancer cancer worker working under Satoru Iwata, began her work on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, responded to a successful Wii console launch.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that was raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata’s footprints, assesses Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to take Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but not to eat bread on the traditional gaming consoles of the company.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Finnish Immigration Service recognised that hundreds of children who have come to the country would disappear every year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minors are lost each year.
Chief Inspector Juha Kannelmaa of the Finnish Immigration Service explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How much is lost in the country of less than a year?- In 2013, a total of 156 minor asylum applications were made in Finland alone.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196, and 11 of them disappeared.
In the background of the disappearance, it may be that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were subject to a decision to terminate because the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared in the past 123 years, he said.
Is the amount of growth?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications for a minor who has come alone.
There are no overall statistics on the missing minor asylum seekers this year, but the number of minor applicants is known and has grown clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What happens to those who have received the conversion decision?
For example, do you lose them to the dark labour market?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the enforcement of the conversion decisions is carried out by the police, Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of Home Affairs Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of non-registered people.
He has taken action on this issue.
During the EU’s internal minister meeting, Orpo said on Monday about practical measures to manage asylum seekers’ flows through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A studio online - see photos of devices
Due to hospital attacks, the equipment used for the production of television and radio production by Timo T.A., who lost their ability to work in the media sector, is now in sales.
Mikkkonen's spouse, Nina Mikkonen, sells Huuto.net devices, which were at the time the most advanced professional tools in their field.
The Internet announcement was first published by Iltamakasin.
Today, much of the equipment is left behind in technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs are no longer available for Betacam.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that interested ones can be found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer in the same way, but these are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasts - collecters and own studio builders, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from their current Myrskylä home.
We can't take all the supplies with us.
I've been inventing a little bit and watching where the goods are being donated.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for television and radio devices.
It is clear from the evidence that a long career-making man no longer returns to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkkonen's actual life work was archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives visited the box shop to pick up films and other materials from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to drill worse: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
The drivers of the metro and trams decide today whether to expand their efforts in relation to the demonstration of the Friday.
The original plan was to stop the tram and tram traffic only for the time of the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon it will be decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief Consultant Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is great in the field.
Night-and-day cuts are very painful for drivers, so the plans of the government to cut the glasses are a source of resistance.
However, it is a kind of dilemma to stop traffic throughout the day.
If the metro and trams stand on Friday, public transport in the metropolitan area is practically completely stopped.
According to VR data, trains do not travel between the morning and the evening.
On Friday, there will be no long-distance or long-haul traffic.
The trains leaving before the morning will be driven to the destination stations.
According to HSL data, most buses remain in shadows.
The members of the ACP will be gone from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturday morning.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by the supervisor, the HSL informant Pirkko Repo suggests.
Repo says that HSL is unable to tell exactly what bus routes are going on Friday.
Remuneration organizations will host a major demonstration at Helsinki Rautatientor on Friday 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, says AP.
Sky News says the refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled the panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at the school in Texas, and the teacher thought he was a bomber.
In Texas, the 14-year-old Ahmed Mohammed has been arrested since the teacher considered him to be a bomb bomber.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted to introduce his electronics industry to the output.
However, one of the teachers thought that the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were invited to the scene, and the situation ended in the end that the boy was taken to the youth detention cell in the cuffs.
Muhammad has not been found at any time to claim that he had made a watch.
Yet, it is still possible that the boy will be accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police said the clock looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in the police custody, but it was known to have been made up of a circuit board and a digital display between which there were wires.
The incident occurred last Monday, and Mohamedia was punished for three days by forced school leave.
His father is angry about the case, and the American Council of America wonders whether the case is another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
British President Labour refused to sing a national song
In the song, God is asked to protect the queen, but Corby is the opponent of monarchy.
The review of the polls by the Committee of Justice has also been joined by the representatives of the Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, according to the Labour spokesman Kate Green, in the BBC radio interview.
Green said Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night, the Battle of British Air Force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940 was respected.
The Labour Party defends Corbyni in its official statement and stresses his respect for the pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude for the heroism of Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood silently during the national song, the opinion highlighted.
Corbyn's choice as party leader has divided the lines of the labour.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will ban moderate voters from his radical views.
Corby supports unilateral armament, stop saving and increase public spending.
Corbyn is scheduled for the first time to appear in the capacity of the party leader in Parliament at the hearing hour of the Prime Minister.
Mr Corbyn has asked the public to make proposals on what should be asked by Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron chose Corbyn as a party leader on Twitter.
The Labour Party is threatening the security of our national security, our financial security and our families, the Prime Minister's reference to your account.
The reason for Minnesota's family death is still unclear - the family's father was waiting for the case.
South Lake Minnesota Police have been investigating a family death in Minnesota Greenwood for a week.
The five-person family was found dead in their home on September 10, and a couple of days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
First, after shooting his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the house garage.
Dead days already
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for inspection visits and found a huge house dead in the short family.
StarTribune said it was possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million House and Successful Company
The investigation of the case of the South Lake Mintonka police chief Michael Siair is still ongoing.
The motive for blood is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on the social media site of the nurses at AllNurses.com.
In the 2014 StarTribune interview, Short reported that there were four million visitors on the site each week.
I’ve had 50 purchases from the company in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to do.
Maybe at some point I'm selling a company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, by the short family buying two million dollars of a cozy house from Greenwood in 2011.
The house is advertised on the property site in Zillow as a dream of a car collector: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also eight cars with adequate garages.
Legal proceedings
StarTribune said the family’s father was waiting for a trial.
The Achieve Test Prep, which offers a variety of preview courses, had challenged him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prepin, no comments had been removed from Short’s website, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the case would have had a significant impact on Short’s transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffees
In addition, the owner’s third party was awarded at the Finnish Hippos’s month horse owner prize.
This is great, Lois said in a good mood on his board of honors.
The party, Fabrice Duo, won Derby on September 1st and earned $100,000.
The artist legend, Loiri, was still confused with the success of Fabrice Duo in the big competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the success horse coach Korpi gets full peace of work when working with the horse.
Pekka determines and decides where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Lois.
The great gesture of the NHL star -- the greatest talent ever made by a sportsman.
The Montreal Canadian Superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about $6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the medical statement, this is the most important donation ever made by a sportsman to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital in other financial collections for the next seven years.
Subban made a deal worth eight years and 72 million dollars a year ago with the Canadians.
The amount of Subban's donation is therefore significantly higher than his $9 million years.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives his name from the hospital.
The Canadians have helped local hospitals significantly before.
A year ago, a long-time captain Jean Beliveau raised millions of dollars to the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a sum of money to the other city's major hospital that gave the hospital the necessary PET scanner for cancer studies.
Japanese coffee can be ordered by the wife for the evening - serves food only bikinis and roses on their head
The coffee is a hard thing in Japan.
The market already has a goat cafe, a chicken cafe, a vampire cafe, a cheap cafe and now a wife's cafe.
It strikes lonely, socialized and hungry.
It's news from Metro.
In Tokyo, Ore no Yome (my wife) coffee can be ordered for the evening of a wife or husband.
This is a waiter who pretends to be a customer’s spouse.
“Puoliso – is selected from the list before coming to the cafe and prepares and serves food.
The wife's only in front of the bust and bikinis on her head, the husband's back in tight bikes.
The website provides all the information about the length and weight of the wife’s candidates to the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: attacks against information security in cars were equipped
In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports the technological development and innovation of the sector, the publication of Intel.
The board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time Intel released the first version of the best practices of cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB’s research results.
Gartner estimates that around 150 million vehicles in traffic have been connected to the network by 2020.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share online data.
We can and we need to improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Chris Young, Head of Intel Securities.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish the best practices on safety and support the view that cybersecurity is a major component in the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB Board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs about 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford Focus RS has been waiting for years as the moon rises.
Finally, the car will also be in the sight of Finland.
Ford has released RS data now that the car world's views are at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford’s new four-wheel RS is accelerating from 2.7 seconds to a zero hundred and a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour thanks to its 2.3-liter, 350-horizont engine.
Finland's interest is also the price, initially it is estimated to be 52,000 euros.
The car is already available, though, when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you when it comes to information.
The favorite brand Kia presented two novelties at Frankfurt’s car show - such as the new Sportage and Optima
In Finland, the new fourth generation of Sportage is more important than the two new ones, with which Kia intends to capture the ever-growing crossroads market.
The new European design director, created by Gregory Guillaume, is more round than before.
There is a cent in the distance and exteriors, and the car is going to fly the air more efficiently.
The engine range is largely unchanged, but it has a 1.6-liter turbo that develops 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance, as well as consumption, will be reported closer to the sales revenue.
We still have to wait a little bit for it, because we have a new Sportage coming in spring 2016.
Before the change of the year, our new Kia Optims arrived.
Suddenly, the news doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a whole new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of top middle-class buyers with better driving features, lower noise levels and higher-level equipment.
Starting with a 1.7-liter turbo diesel and a 2.0-liter petrol engine, Optimos are available.
Next summer, the pace is accelerating when the Optima GT, equipped with a 2.0-liter turbo motor, comes next to them.
At the same time, the sale of Optima Farmer begins with its income.
Chisu returned to the stage - rapped in a brave haalarian boat
The singer Chisu is involved in the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric pants are equipped with an open neck hole.
The house is beautifully presented by the singer star's chip belt.
The whole is crowned by a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three-year break, the singer who became a mother has been forced to get pregnant with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will be over a year soon.
The singer released his first single album in August.
Getting back to the ships and the general public after a long break is not really exciting for me.
I have missed everything to do with music, the singer says.
Chisu will publish a new and fourth album called Polaris in a couple of weeks.
The new life situation has inspired us to make new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's mother-in-law style makes me feel like it's now showing up in the chest.
True-tv beauty Kim Kardashian gives speeches to one another.
She presents her pregnancy and breasts with an abstinence in sexy clothes, last night at one of America's last night, when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian with her husband Kanye West's bowl.
Black maternity dress is transparent from the chests.
It reveals the skin-colored bras under the light of the lightning lights.
Last time Kardashian dressed for an amasonic maternity stand when he visited his friend at dinner parties in New York just a couple of days ago.
The agency highlighted the black upper-polenical boots.
The third special maternity dress is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when the performance was full of pregnancy.
The hard laws of the world: No home, you are lonely, the competition is terrible
Manon Leloup wanted to shorten the idea that the model world would be a clean glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary, Speking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues speak of the clean model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season begins from scratch.
Even if in the previous season you would have been porcelain in the costumes of top designers, the new season will begin again in Casting.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces in the industry that compete with the convents.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can go even a year in such a way that there is a hotel room or apartment in which fashion houses can accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother is unable to travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not only one kind of weight loss.
Agent in New York may ask for a drop in pounds, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is always a risk game.
Fashion designers and designers are always together and work as a support network.
When the fashionians stop, the difference is tricky.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are pale at the fact that everyone thinks the work is just a demonstration of clothes.
Models also want to be their own person.
The work makes the models feel that they are actors with some role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models on Tory Burch's screen yesterday.
In New York, fashion weeks are currently being held, where designers will reveal their next year’s model.
Roope Salminen, who has changed his style, plays the most famous Apulanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen plays Antti Lautala, a band-based film based on the early years of the Apulanta band.
Lautala founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but separated from the band in 1994.
This is a big challenge for me because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I have not wanted to meet the right Antti before the descriptions because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people from that group, so I think it's okay to learn her playing style only from the video.
I don't want to make an impression of a man.
A man who trusts the Roope Salminen and Dogs is not a source of the role.
The punk mangers come naturally.
In the punk season of the star show, many of us must have seen the first taste, as well as if you've ever been to our gigs.
Our appearances have never been any small thing, but we always go full.
In 1993-2004, the main actors of the film, directed by Tuukka Temosen, were released today.
A core group known to the band is still quite unknown to the public by young actors.
Rumbali Sipe Santapukk is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temo Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a tip about his future laundry last night, when he told Snapchat that he was secretly preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published a picture of his new story on Instagram yesterday, which he has been forced to perform for the film.
The Roope, previously seen in the black and jaws, has turned his face into siloposchic, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychological advice: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have been forced to think over the last few days about how to tell children about the situation of refugees in Europe.
Or is it worth telling me at all?
There is no need to speak to the public, member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected, for example, and not allowed to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can remain in the mind and anxiety, he says.
However, if the child has encountered TV news photos of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth talking about.
It is good to have a conversation from the start of the child and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fear of the child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones that parents think he's afraid of.
You don’t need to be afraid of anything, even if you’re worried and scared.
A smaller child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will also feel safe.
The older children are likely to talk about refugees in school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to talk to them if it is a matter of thinking about a child.
The fact is that all people in the world are not well.
Parents, together with their children, can think about how to deal with this in our family.
In the end, is the world a safe or safe place?
Parents may also have different educational angles - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult things, the child will get a model of how to deal with the difficulties ahead of life.
This can be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: “ Teach your child to help you weaker –
Your strengths at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
Vermos pallosalamaa hard to control
Perttu Pohjola was rubbed into the Apila Pallosalama in the middle summer.
It only ravaged the winnings and the two-wheelers until at the end of July in Tampere, there was a collapse.
Since the Ori was largely clogged, the coach suspected that something was wrong and ordered his passport for a period of time from the vet.
The explanation for stopping was found in the alphabet.
The horse had a sore throat.
The disease was not the most mildest to get, but the fall of it took two medications.
Since the Apilan Pallosalama had to be in light motion, Pohjola says he is welcome for the last run of the surprised horse.
It was in Turku after the second SE-dam after Taruntulle.
The Apila Pallosalama was very depressed when it could have been driven normally for just a few weeks.
Those things, with a small tendency at the end, were understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a good competition made a steel for the Ori.
The horse must have moved on from it, and I hope it would have been even more balanced.
Apila Pallosalama has been so-called humor horses.
When you haven’t enjoyed it, it could have thrown you fat without getting sick.
On a good day orientees have instead removed such a mystery that the opponents have been in wonders.
At the speed of the pätkälä, the skiers will not be able to cope with Pallosalamaa, where even warm-blooded rides will be removed.
Pohjola's wishes are a mirror run in Vermo.
However, the different thing is how Apilan Pallosalama agrees.
It is quite difficult at the time of departure and may even fall under the boom of the departure car and such.
I hope the slave would be calmer than the departure of Turku.
The Apilan Pallosalama will be able to come out of the ring as well, and we will go on to drive it out of victory, coach promises.
That's why you can't get rid of the bad iPhone programs.
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of Apple's iPhone phones may be removed from future programs, but not all of them.
Apple will probably remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, says the CEO of the company Tim Cook Buzzfeed in an interview.
Apple's iPhone has a set of programs that are rarely used: FaceTime, Journalist, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcast and Vinkis come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became an obsessive update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple’s smart watch owners.
Cook said the removal of Apple programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps have been linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications work in close cooperation with other programs.
There are other programs that don’t work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop the way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the issue because the company does not want to waste memory from users’ iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1% in August
In August, consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly by 0.1% year-on-year, the EU statistical authority said today.
The rise in prices was slowing down the price of energy.
In this way, Eurostat reviewed the 0.2% guarantee for a couple of weeks.
In July the inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called basic inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
The Eurostat estimate was 1.0 per cent of the baseline inflation.
Energy was 7.2% cheaper in the euro area than a year ago.
The average inflation rate in the 28 EU countries was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
Most of the euro area, i.e. 1.4 per cent of consumer prices, rose in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest as prices fell by 1.9%.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2% minus the EU's harmonised index rate.
Inflation in the euro area continues to be very far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target, which is a two-percent rate increase in the medium term.
The ECB expects inflation of 0.1% on average for the euro area this year.
Next year, the central bank will rise to 1.1% in its new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Fed is now trying to blackmail monetary policy.
The U.S.’s next recession will begin at a speed of less than a year, but more likely within three years after the country’s central bank Fed starts to raise its interest rates again for a long time.
In the financial markets, the fall begins before the next recession.
Fed has suggested that the interest rates might start this week and not later than by the end of the year.
Thus, the next recession can be pushed at its fastest by next autumn and as a course for the financial market before.
Or at least this happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets work the way they've been, and if they react to the tension of Fed's money money as they've done before.
These conclusions have been concluded by the German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker for a wide range of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed over 60-page Long-Tem Asset Return Study to its international major customers last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe they know exactly when Fed is going to raise its interest rates or what is going on in the economy and the market after that.
Instead, they present economic statistics with cool facts and calculations of how the economy and markets have behaved before and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at the key variables of the economy and financial markets now in the same or other model as in previous interest rates - and what will possibly follow.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more horrifying state to withstand interest rates than ever before in the 1950s.
Not even a year at the beginning of the recession.
Fedi’s monetary policy and its respective vigour leaders have been pointing out that the time has begun to be ripe at interest rates.
The first interest rate for more than nine years can take place this week.
The matter will be settled during the Wednesday and Thursday, when the Board of Directors of Fed is meeting with the Open Market Committee to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
Last time, Fed raised its so-called Fed funds ratio in June 2006.
At the end of the same two years, the relatively regular but at a time a small series of 0.25 percentage points of interest that Fed raised its interest rate from 1.25 per cent to 5.25 per cent.
In 2007, the symptom of the financial market began with the difficulties of the most risky housing funding in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis became a global nightmare of the Judgment Day.
A major recession arrived in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economy failures began to slow down more than before Fed's interest rates have typically occurred.
Similarly, the trials were harder and tougher than ever since the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have been screening the rises and declines of the world's largest economies, as well as financial market fluctuations since 1950 and places from the beginning of the 19th century.
From Fed's interest and their financial and financial impact they have been making clear since the 1950s.
The fastest time to start the recovery has taken less than three years, most often less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The financial market rise has ended within two years of the start of Fed's interest rates.
Fed has increased and in turn decreased its control rate by a dozen different cycles since the beginning of the 1950s.
Each time has been different from the others in some respects, and the odds have been relatively limited, so they can hardly conclude anything certain about the impact of the following interest rates.
The strategies remind us that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest too low for too long
The reasons for the financial crisis may not necessarily be found indisputably by decades of research.
But three things about the leaders of the crisis and the reasons for its devastating effects are probably somewhat undisputed:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, the euro area ECB and the other world’s largest central banks considered their governance interest rates to be too low.
They met the traces of the technoupla, and then raised the next one.
2) Over the decades, the amount of debt accumulated in different parts of the financial and real economy, and above all, increased even greater than the monetary policy impact of central banks.
The largest debt bubble in economic history was born.
3) In particular, the crazy debt financing packaged to the financial economy, the largest exchange rate of shares in real estate, debt books and commodities, in most financial market areas, in the past.
Even so, it is hardly very difficult to argue that the financial market that has risen to the highest levels in the case of more complex debt advances was rarely dangerous and unstable when Fed and other central banks last drove up interest rates.
The financial structure of the debt relief funds was not as long as the valuation coupons had begun after the interest rates had started and the debt financing costs had turned up.
The risks took place as a financial crisis and resulted in a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategies do not think what's going to happen, but give the subject of nuclear activity by mentioning, for example, the following aspects:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now considered their monetary policy to be even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been crazy as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is at its cheapest literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the financial and real debt ratio has not been reduced, but now, in different parts of the economy, the debt burden is much more severe than before or before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity that has flown from the former and cheaper central banks has largely remained in the financial markets and has slowed the key types of securities and assets to the peak or ever before the financial crisis.
And not only are strategies of latish atmosphere with financial market warnings, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of severe recession to the model as it has been before.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in unusually weak condition, but the pressures and risks of the financial market are significantly higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next comes to tightening its money out more tightly.
Perhaps the picture of Albert Edwards’ future is not as strange as it may suddenly be.
He has been coaching the bank’s international investors for the following full translations:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles break down, and soon Fedin will have time to shut down the financial burns with even bigger QE money injections.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is planning to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are directed at HP’s corporate service side, the company says.
HP is divided into HP Inc., the Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the consumer.
HP was the largest employee in 2011, with 350,000 employees.
Last October, the staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company accounts for a one-off cost of $2.7 billion (around €2.4 billion) from the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The consumer side will be reduced to 3300 within three years.
HP plans to transfer its operations to low cost countries, with 60% of its employees in the low cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers will be responsible for more than 10% of its operating profit.
In the second year, its three major customers accounted for 65% of their operating profit.

Yle: Minister Berner has worked in the government of the tax haven company
Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (centrally) has been a member of the government of the tax haven.
According to Ylen, the company’s activities have been linked to the so-called tax planning.
This is a Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo company appointed by Berner as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still an official member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself said he had left a notice of resignation in May of this year.
I checked it out and it's enough that I've left a notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place on an agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after fusion
Through the Luxembourg company, ownership of the Swedish Kährs company is managed.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer who merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner worked with the Government of Karelia-Upoflor in 2010-2013 and after the merger with the Government of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Ylen, Kährs's ownership is transferred to Luxembourg through a multi-ported ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he received a government membership in the Luxemburg company Kährs at the request of the second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been involved in the Board of Karelia-Upoflor owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was asked for a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my task was to take care of the capital of the Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that the revenues of our Finnish companies’ capitals are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's owners are not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure of tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs had already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership by Triton.
The reception centre operated by the company will be opened in Espoo
Espoo Otaniemi opens the first reception centre maintained by the company for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first hundred inhabitants from tonight.
The number of places can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre for the property of the former Rescue University.
The activity is maintained by Luona Oy, whose sector is primarily the production of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy are, among other things, agreed on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares an alternative labour market tightening package
STTK is preparing an alternative package of government working hardships.
The organisation also hopes that other organisations of the Employee Centre will be involved.
According to President Antti Palola, today's attention is on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing the cost of work will be returned after that.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola noted the organization’s administrative meeting at a break for journalists.
Palola estimates that the Central Economic Union (EC) is not ready for discussions.
STT’s economists have calculated that the change in the government’s competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million when the second half of the package is 2 700 million.
I don’t know if there’s a terrible enthusiasm on the part of the party to have a conversation if there’s a one-way relationship with a hundred.
Palola: Negotiation connection was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, as the government is to submit its own package of information to the Parliament and to start preparing for reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government, and it has always been constructive for him.
In the field of STTK, especially for Sunday girls, Palola says it is a painful place.
The organisation requires that the government withdraws from the mandatory legislation to implement part of the blackmail.
According to the STK, Palola does not welcome the preparation of an alternative package with SDP.
On Friday, the employees will meet with Helsinki to oppose the work-related tightening package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the salary of the first sick days is cut, the over-work compensation is halved, the Sunday compensation is reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced.
The STTK emphasizes that central organizations have invited employees to protest, and that the purpose has not been to hold a strike.
Avan Fjäder
The President of the Plan, Mr Fjäder, congratulates the STKK for the announcement of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, the STKK is now coming into the same lines with the Plan, since the Plan has already set up an alternative model for government presentations.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in an alternative package, because without the SAK the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
The plan president, Mr Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, led by Mr Lauri Lyly, will prepare the proposal for surgery.
Antti Palola's STKK said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the plan announced that it had long prepared its own proposal to negotiate the country’s government’s goal of achieving a 5% competitive jump as an alternative to cuts.
The plan has been ready to negotiate all the time, and we have long written an alternative model for government presentations.
We are ready to see the terms of the service as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also enter the Plan lines, as the STK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing a model for the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
The proposed Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
\"The same boat, the common coal, the loots - play bingo while talking to Sipilä in the evening
the University of Tampere Green Left
The Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional talks during the rebellion and wars in Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland’s economy on the Ylen channels on Wednesday at 21.05.
When applying for a similar speech from the Prime Minister, we must go to 1932 when the Prime Minister, Mr Evind Svinhufvud, was the prime minister, holding a famous radio call that marked the beginning of the end of the rebellion in Mäntsälä.
After that, the President and Ministers held a number of radio calls during the Winter and Continue War.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held a New Year's Speech instead of Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen stopped on television with a phone call from the train drivers' strike.
Single call, monarchist makeup
The talk of the Sipilka has raised all day's criticism and guesses about what I'm going to do.
On Twitter, President of the Left, Paavo Arhinmäki said: “Silpä could speak about the state of the nation in the House as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would allow the speech to be discussed.
According to Green Ville Niinistö, an exclusive call has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the SDP Erkki Tuomio condemned that “mono-architectural makeup: the Prime Minister tells the people what’s best for it.”
Mr Rinne, president of the SDP, challenged the Sipilä dialogue: “It has been six months since the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it was directly commented by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EC CEO Jyri Häkä Man.
It is highly appreciated that the speech of Sipilä has been made.
We considered the issue and said that it is part of the public service mission to promote the entire public sector in Finland, in the news of Ismo Silva Yle, the director of Yle’s publications.
As in the time of the Tammels
The speech has also brought up an atrocities.
The dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the kids will be combed and put on their best.
Mom puts on a nicest skull, and her father agrees with her neck.
At nine o'clock, it's going to be silenced by the TV as before the time of the We Tammelians,\" wrote Saku Timonen.
“In the speech of Prime Minister Sipilä, we also ask why the government of Finland is sitting in tax havens of millions of dollars hiding their capital capital, who are making the mercy laws for their fellow taxiers and, at the same time, claiming to the people that it is necessary to cut the money when the government is out of money, asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess shows the Green Left Viva of Tampere University.
It has been published on Facebook by the next bingo.
Can we hear about the same boat, the common coal, the living of the debtors and the team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21.05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: the Western countries rejected the Russian proposal for the deportation of al-Assad
Over three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to give up power, according to President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian U.N. Ambassador proposed a plan for al-Assad to leave the power in style after some time.
However, the Western countries did not accept the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
The Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurk, in a bilateral debate, listed a three-point plan for him: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and the abandonment of al-Assad had to be carried out in a controlled manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree with all of these things, but we are able to speak openly.
I told him what I did there, and he said to sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what to do, Ahtisaari reminds me of Guardian's interview.
Diplomatics do not comment
The Ahtisaari tells us that Tshurkin's message was delivered to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the newspaper, but Ahtisaari said there are no two words for it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari’s claims, but said that at that time the al-Assad forces had already committed several mass killings and the central opposition groups refused all the agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former director of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressed doubts about the speech of Ahtisaari, because, according to his experience, Russia was not ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad at any time.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
In a moment, Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's authority.
If he had told me about the words of Tshurkin, I would have answered that I would like to hear from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's rock to keep power with some al-Assad supporter.
The exhaust current of our own actions
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have fled their homes because of war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own actions.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we have caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the magazine.
Asylum Seekers’ Organisation Centre on Storm Tower
The asylum search organisation centre designed by the Government in North Finland is likely to be established in Toronto.
The centre would be set up in the building of the empty tower joint-lyse building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better manage refugee flows from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat announced Tuesday that the council had already decided to present the school building as a temporary solution to the ministry.
According to the City Council Vice-President Sauli Hööppinen (left), it is not true.
When the entire delegation was not gathered and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting to decide on the matter next Monday, he specified it to the STT.
At the local discussion, 36 of 43 were authorised.
The organisation centre was opposed by 13 authorised persons.
Based on this, the decision could be expected to be positive, says Hööppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and quickly responded.
There would be an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has been checking that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would also work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä is still hoping for an alternative to the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally), half of the public holidays would only be managed by part of the government’s efforts to calculate the cost of work.
However, the government is pleased to accept an alternative package if the social partners succeed in reaching such an agreement.
Sipilä told the journalists that he had not been involved in the labour market organisations.
He also did not know how serious the organizations were looking for alternatives to the government's announcement of working tensions.
If such an agreement is created, we will be happy to accept it as part of the entire package.
In Sipilä’s view, half of the money would be a means of working, because it would be directed at almost all payers unlike, for example, the government’s planned Sundays cut.
The labour market organisations could agree on the cuts in holidays between themselves, because they are registered in collective agreements instead of law.
The Government will present this vision to the Parliament next week on Wednesday about the tensions in working life in the form of a government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final back line either.
The legislative work will then start to move, i.e. the train is moving and it will get harder all the time.
Now's a good time.
It won’t take long for such things if there’s a will, Sipilä wrote.
The list published last week by the Government has, among other things, the conversion of the final and helatorsta into unpaid days without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, the first days of illness are cut, overpaid, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays reduced.
Reforms will be implemented as mandatory legislation over trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
As a result of the activities, the remuneration centre organisations organise a major demonstration on Friday, in addition to which several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi Council approved the extension of the storage of the juice hall
The Tohmajärvi delegation unanimously approved the extension of the Nordic Koivu Oy Hall, which is a bit of a minor.
The fact is that the project is bigger and more expensive than it was originally mentioned.
Also a busy schedule badly.
It was also a little wonder that the subscription was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock between 400 and 450 square metres was approved in the Investment Programme, but the funding will be decided more closely in the context of the Interim Report.
A further item on the agenda was the EUR 150 000-200 000 investment, but the technical manager Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it would bring work and tax revenues to the location.
The municipality does not have a risk, as the company pays the investment as a rental, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justified.
Karelian Language Location in Joensuu
The city government reduced its former sharp position to bring the street signs of the Cattle language to the city centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right to preserve the tradition of livestock throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language, because there are no historical grounds for it and the language of the herd is not an inherent part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the region of Joensuu has been more part of the eastern savoi fractures.
After a new decision, there will be no street names signs in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, prepared to use the Karelian language, for example, in the information boards and marketing of tourism.
The same attitude is recommended for all other actors.
Even though Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth taking a spacious approach to the use of the Cattle language now that multiculturalism lives and changes heavily in Northern Karelia.
Karelian language is still a special feature of the county, as well as an image of Joensuu as the entire forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can benefit from a wide range of marketing in the county.
Stopping train connections cut the country's vitality
The cuts of train connections hit the country's vitality with a hard hand.
Transport connections directly affect the economy and competitiveness of the county.
And it affects whether we can live and work here, the Mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also points out air transport, which has also been carried out several times in the report.
For the whole country, it is important that we do not have the opportunity to reduce by the measures of government, as is now going on.
The effects of these transport connections on employment should be considered, for example, by Karjalainen.
The deterioration of transport connections causes an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here are, such as transport connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees, Jukka Mönkkönen, head of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport connections also affect the faculty, which is highly mobile and travels a lot because of the study.
Marko Junkkarinen, Chief of Recruitment, says that it is already difficult to market the university towards Western Finland, because the connections are weak in the direction of the difference.
Currently about half of students from the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
On the other hand, around 10-20 per cent of them are from New Zealand, partly explained by direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of my sororities at the Siu War
The views of the City Government of Joensuu on the region's Siu war project are apparently unanimous, but one of my sornal voices is among them.
Member of the City Government Pentti Central (sd., in the picture) presented the Government’s Monday meeting to give up the entire project, but his presentation fell unprofitable.
The Government approved the Kari Karjalainen decision-making proposal, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time with all the other municipalities.
One train from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year
Traffic in passenger trains from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although one train line will be less frequent.
There will be changes in passenger transport between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train pair will be left out, but five more times a day, Kouvola will enter Kouvola from Kotka and vice versa.
The reduction is due to state savings.
The purchase of the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely terminated.
VR will prepare new schedules by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed on the roof, one didn't get down, the guys were out of place.
The rescue facility lets a 12-year-old climb from the roof, who couldn’t get down the roof with his own help.
The situation was born in Tornion Hill on Ketotie on Tuesday night at 6:30 p.m.
There is an old two-storey wooden house where there are no ladders on the roof.
It did not prevent a boy group who decided to climb the house to the roof along the mass of the radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got the same route down, but one didn't.
As a result, the rest of the people lived from the place and the passers were alerting the rescue facility to help the pulleys safely return to the surface of the earth.
FedEx's net sales fluctuate, weaker outlook for the financial period 2016
FedEx announced its weak result in the last quarter. The transport industry left its forecast for the whole year, due to the decrease in freight demand and the increased costs of land transport.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Last year, FedEx announced that he would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
The company’s share decreased by about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the actual trade was opened on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is $10.40-10.90 for the financial period ending in May. The forecast is 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to FactSet's research, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has decreased on average despite an increase in the price of 4.9%. The increases will take effect on 4 January. Additional charges for land transport of heavy or large-scale shipments will enter into force in November.
The company is still waiting for income growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, increased net sales and increased online trade growth.
President and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company has been doing well in a well-awaited weaker economic situation, which has tried in particular production and global trade.
The seasonal workers' recruitment plans were announced on the day after the competitor UPS announced that he would employ the largest number of seasonal workers in the last year, i.e. 90,000 to 95,000 people.
In the quarter ended on 31 August, FedEx's operating profit was $692 million, which means a 6% increase.
The share-by-share result was $2.42, and the $1.44 estimate of the 12 analysts in the Zacks Investment Research company was left.
Net sales rose by five per cent to $12.3 billion.
According to the six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, net sales were expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been experiencing a decrease in international first-class shipments, which has led to the company’s Express unit’s slowdown.
The strong growth of the online trade has confirmed the result of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport turnover grew by 29 per cent, but the operating profit showed increased costs for large-scale shipments and insurance.
The Express unit produced better due to higher basic payments, while the return on freight business decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the actual trade opening FedEx’s share rate had fallen to $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $15.15.
On Tuesday, the share decreased by 11 per cent from the annual average and 17 per cent from the highest notation recorded on 11 June.
This week, the decision-makers of the US Central Bank Fed will meet for the most anticipated meeting in the years. The group will sit at its diameter next to the eight-metre North Office to decide whether it will be time for the first time to raise interest rates to almost a decade.
On the wall of the central bank’s decorative, double-storey meeting room, a wall painting of the United States is displayed.
The map is a reminder that the central bank’s President Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues must put the financial interests of the state above all the other interests.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, since the Great Depression, the central bank’s management has noted the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This mandate may be absent from the point of view of the decision of the strain. On Thursday, the central bank is expected to announce whether the U.S. economy is ready to start a withdrawal from an unforeseen irritation, which has been offered by short interest rates at the end of 2008 close to zero.
Although most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, recent financial market shocks can already be made available by cautious central bank officials to shake the volatility by raising the federal tax reference rate – even in the quarter of the percentage point.
“The labour market and inflation are naturally the first and most important in their practical follow-up,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, the chief economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“I believe, however, that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty of the global market will give enough cause to wait, Piegza will continue.
Those who have considered the matter do not agree with what the central bank is going to do, which already causes nervousness in itself.
About half of the economists in Bloomberg’s study were exhausted by the rise of interest rates this week.
However, the financial market is considered to be expected by the central bank, and the key indicator suggests that there is only a 30% chance of lifting.
If the central bank raises its control rate, the share rates may be calculated unless the decision-makers soften the impact by promising another increase.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index localized 228,89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599,85.
“At the backdrop of the flooding, there were expectations that the central bank would keep the steering interest stable this week,” said the head economist John Lonski, the head economist of Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest at this point,” he said.
If this were the case, the central bank should consider precisely how to keep the hands of financial operators without shaking the financial markets.
On the other hand, the experts noted that by raising interest rates, the financial market could be calmed down and the uncertainty about when the central bank would operate.
Only a month ago, the central bank seemed to be tilting to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step in tightening the financial conditions and thereby strengthening the U.S. recovery.
Yellen has stated that the spring and the early summer had been expected to raise interest rates this year – despite the need for economic progress according to liberals.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, and its level is now at its lowest level for seven years and close to the level that the central bank calculates for full employment.
Pay income seems to be shrinking
Although inflation continued to fall below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the central bank’s decision-makers concluded that the main reason for this is the temporary impact of steep oil prices.
“The economy can cope with even higher interest rates and needs them as long as they take into account the tight labour market situation,\" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
However , the financial markets across the world did not bother last month , when China devalued its currency .
Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by up to 16 percentage points of May’s record height, and investors were afraid of China’s economic recovery also affecting global growth.
The markets have been vaporized this month, and Dow Jones has now dropped almost 10% of the May high-rise.
The impact of the market means that the decision-makers of the central bank will be more complicated to reflect on the increase in the interest rate.
“The work of the Central Bank is complicated despite what happened in the financial markets and the news about the deterioration of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate senior researcher and former central bank official Stephen D. Oliner said.
He now believes that the central bank expects at least a month to deal with the effects.
“There is great uncertainty about what will have an impact on the US economy, and there is little reliable information about the recent situation in the Chinese economy,\" he said.
The health of the world economy is not the central bank’s main concern, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential in the world’s monetary economy.
The impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, only a hint from Ben S. Bernanken, then president, was that the central bank could narrow down its scope of its activities caused the world-wide uprising.
In today’s world, markets and economies are strongly intertwined, and in addition to monitoring the world’s trends, the central bank is also required to contact other central banks and experts to have a good overall picture of the world economy.
“The decision-making process of the Central Bank is more art than science, according to Zachary Karabell, Director of the Global Strategy of the Finance Management Company Envestnet Inc.
In this month, President Jeffrey Lacker of the Regional Central Bank of Richmond said that the central bank had previously overreacted to movements of financial markets that do not seem to be connected to the fundamental pillars of the economy.
Member of the Federal Open Market Committee, Mr Lacker, has called for an increase in the interest rate, as an example of decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
“The economic crisis in Asia led the central bank to decide at three meetings to reduce the control rate by 0.75 percentage points, although only limited sanctions were available for US economic growth, Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank repealed the decision.
“The Central Bank should set financial stability for the first time only in a major crisis, such as the collapse of the 2008 economy,” said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England Interest Committee.
The last blow doesn't even approach the situation at the time, he said.
“There is no reason to fear the rise of the choirs because of the shock of the market, the Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen added.
“The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate, and it does not mention the financial stability. Before this change, I do not think I should go ahead of things.”

Brazilian Rio Grande Children’s Association to Promote a Good Diet for Breastfeeding
The Brazilian Rio Grande Association of Children’s Doctors (SPRS) has developed a blinding way to teach nursing women a proper diet. They are presented with photos of babies breasts that are nursing with unhealthy food pictures.
Human breast milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates. Thus, the baby receives all the nutrients he needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Due to extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 kilocalories.
According to a new study, in addition to adding calories, other changes should be made to the diet.
The recent study by Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that the healthy diet of a pregnant woman can affect the baby’s genes and protect the baby from tumor development.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
Seven Sunrise's biggest spectators, even though Nine is trying to catch the lead in his Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson would like to see Canberra do a morning program for the next promotions of the Liberal Party's leadership election, which did not improve Today's viewers.
The morning program of the Nine Channel was sent from the capital city of Malcolm Turnbull's abandoned Tony Abbott.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage’s competing channel morning program was sent from London. The program’s weekly special broadcasts are also sent from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance apparently did not matter to Australian television viewers, as Sunrise looked at an average of 397,000 viewers in five state capitals, and Today’s 339,000 viewers.
Today’s audiences slightly increased to last Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000), but remained from last Thursday’s reading (343,000).
Today has closed the distance to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, on average, there were 318,000 viewers, Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, there were between 40,000 and 50 000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has reached an average of 349,000 viewers and today 314,000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event all morning.
Changes in the winds will affect Parliament more this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

Sam Wood is truly the son of Dreams, but whose man chooses?
Is the secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Flows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have deliberately revealed the choice of a son-in-law of Dreams.
The final choice of son Sam Wood has been a secret that has been carefully guarded.
There are no words of the three remaining women who have received the last rose from the boy.
We asked about the atmospheres of Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoskin and Lana Jeavons-Fellows before one out of three was dropped.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women were delighted that Wood was the perfect man. Women praised the man’s sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness and considered him a suitable partner for themselves.
When women were asked who would be the best partner for Wood, if the last rose didn’t hit its own place, their answer could indicate who would take the boy’s heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay the most suitable partner for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been going easy since the beginning.
“When I arrived at the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam fit together well. This feeling has been preserved throughout the program,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
\"Sarah has feet in the country, and he's really having a great time,\" Markoski added.
“I’ve seen them together, and I have to admit that there is chemistry between them.
They seem to be a creative couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she's a good couple of herself and Sam Wood.
Mackay told me he realized last week on a home-town date that Wood could be the right one.
\"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is not just a race, and I'm now putting our relationship in full,\" Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if the man did not choose her, she responded with dignity:
\"I can't say,\" he said.
“I like other girls as much. Snezana and Lana are equal.
The son-in-law of dreams on the Ten Channel on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayne has several options for NFL career launch
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne after this modified United States. Also, several other clubs were interested in the man after the last year’s impressive open day of training.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the button.
Some coaches would have liked Hayne on the bench, as a man went to the Australian rugby team in the lines. Hayne shone the flight kickback to the team after winning on Tuesday from Minnesota, from 20 to 3.
Tomsula, however, showed his confidence in Hayne and gave the man a new chance to return the plane. The coach held Hayne in the game after the fall of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula also continued his line in the costume box after the game.
He didn’t rob incomes in front of the other team, but he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a press conference after the game.
The 49ers Special Editor Cam Inman reported that Hayne was encouraged by specialist coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne is going to blow the capture, in the first quarter of the game against Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and his Australian fans had been expecting another man from NFL-debyy.
Hayne left the field after the failure and later told Hamish and Andy of the 2 DayFM 104.1 channel that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
\"This happens, and we need to move forward,\" Hayne said.
Hayne compared the mistake of his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007, when his feed was opened to Queensland in his own area.
The whole experience was still amazing for a 27-year-old youth.
On Instagram, Hayne published a picture of her positioning together with fans and Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Hodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun at the airport in Siberia.

Four dead policemen shot in rubber poles in Nepal
Four people died in South Nepal, the official source told me Wednesday, and the police shot a crowd on rubber poles in a protest against the alleged new constitution of the country, among the victims was a four-year-old boy.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the district of Rwanda, nearly three hundred kilometers from the capital of Katmandus.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of which threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used tear gas and came into the air before shooting rubber bullets.
He said twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubberoids, which, yes, can kill but which are generally considered to be an alternative to less destruction, suddenly were so deadly.
This was the most recent confrontation in weeks of constant protests at the southern tasangs of Nepal, where according to the Madhesi tribe, the new constitution-based counties would weaken their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in West Nepal, where the Tharus tribe requires its own state.
At least 40 people, of which 11 are police officers, have died in violent terrors since August 10,
When four major political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country to the counties, it is a major step towards the new constitution, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where the government has concentrated for centuries.
The new constitution has been working since 2008, but the legislation has accelerated the process since thousands of people died in the shocking earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted on the constitutional clauses of the Constitution this week, and the authorities believe that the new Charter could be approved by Sunday.
NHC hurricane center: 60% probability for cyclone in the south of Cape Verde

According to the Miami Air Science Department, Cape Verde and the Small Antillie are located in the middle of a clear low pressure center, and it can also become a tropical cyclone in the next two days with a 60 percent probability.
Google plans to collect $111 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced that it would launch a campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian aid organisations that help thousands of people fleeing war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced a donation campaign in its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of the management, the campaign launched a Google employee Rita Masoud by telling about his own experiences. He was only seven years old when he fled Kabul with his family.
“We traveled through the dark train and bus and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
As the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe, many families in similar situations need help.
Donations are assigned to non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children's Association and the United Nations Refugee Organization.
When donations have been collected at google.com/refugeerelef via $55 million, Google promises to donate the corresponding amount, making the total reach of 11 million.
The European refugee crisis has since been the worst since World War II, especially the four-year civil war in Syria, which has resulted in more than four million people fleeing their home this year.
The war is also forced to flee Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to a new study, moderately overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether you live mildly overweight type 2 diabetics after a obesity surgery longer than those who receive surgery-free treatment.
“It takes time to obtain mortality data,” Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, said in a new study in JAMA Surgery.
With muscle surgery, or bariatric surgery, the stomach is reduced by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
During the years, bariatric cuts have been found to be effective in type 2 diabetes. However, the majority of studies have been applied to overweight subjects with a body weight index (BMI) of at least 35.
The weight index shall indicate the weight and length in which the normal value is 18.5-24.9.
When the weight index is over 25, the person is overweight, and the weight index of over 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers at the University of Taiwan’s Min-Sheng Hospital used data collected from 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, gastric surgery and hive surgery, treatment of type 2 diabetes with mildly obese individuals.
After a muscle surgery, the average body weight index fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The weight index of patients receiving surgery was maintained at 29 hours.
Diabetes treated with surgery improved by a total of 36% and partly 28%.
In the treatment-treated group, diabetes only improved by 1% and in part by only about 2%.
The study also found that blood pressure, triglycerides, and bad LDL cholesterol were better in the treatment group.
Researchers also observed haemoglobin levels of A1c in patients, which reflect the development of blood sugar levels.
According to researchers, the recommended haemoglobin level of A1c is less than 7%.
After surgery, the haemoglobin value of A1c decreased on average from 9% to 6%.
In the treatment group, approximately 8% remained unchanged.
However, the study group, led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsun, says that this did not reduce mortality in five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different cutting methods.
During the fifth year, weight loss in the gastric surgery group was higher than in the hemorrhoids (18.7 and 14.2 kg), weight loss was higher (7.4 and 5.1), as well as in the hemoglobin A1c levels (3.1 % and 2.1 %). In the hazard surgery group, diabetes was also improved in the majority (46.9% and 16.7%).
However, the new study was unable to demonstrate a lower mortality after five years. According to a Swedish study by the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix, surgery will lead to life-years for obese individuals.
In a Swedish study, the likelihood of a stomach surgery was reduced by 29% in 15 years compared to the traditional treatment group.
Although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, Blackstone claimed that individuals with a body weight index of less than 35 would benefit from the measure.
“This is the most important finding of the study, as according to which the surgery is safe in the lower weight index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease,” Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take serious weight when the weight index is 27-30.
“We’re waiting too long for people to take the situation seriously,” the researcher said.
“When human body has accumulated genetic changes that expose to obesity and diabetes, it’s really difficult to reverse the situation.”
“Everyone can’t come to Europe – Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is unable to receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama has stated, and he believes that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leading character of Tibet's Buddhism has called for the abolition of violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama dealt with the refugee crisis during his speech in the UK. The Dalai Lama spoke at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the present situation, humanity must be placed ahead of individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not sufficient in this situation.
“It’s impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” the Dalai Lama said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their efforts in a crisis situation, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
“It is a great work to deal with dangerous refugees, but at the same time we have to think about long-term solutions and how to achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education, the Dalai Lama stressed.
“In the end, we need to consider how we can reduce killing in these countries.
The use of power must be reduced.
The power has never solved any problems, he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's action in the course of the September 11th terrorist attacks and claimed that when he resorted to the use of force in response to the terrorist attack in the United States, he created an uncontrollable chain of events.
“After the 11th September attacks, I expressed my regret at President Bush and told me that the solution would be created through violence.
I know his purpose was good, but he resorted to forces with unpredictable consequences,\" the Dalai Lama said.
Hand-switching cases quadrupled in children in four years
According to Georgia’s poison centers across the United States, their alcohol content has been reported to be nearly quadrupled in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the director of the Georgian Poisoning Centre, the ingestion cases reported to the poison centers in children under the age of 12 increased from 3666 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
“These products are more and more accessible to children, and unfortunately some of the children are getting first aid,” Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink hands intentionally to impress their friends and part of the social media as encouraged.
YouTube videos feature teens who drink disinfectant due to cheap humala.
Teen are told to mix alcohol into a disinfectant to make a drink stronger.
Smaller children can be attracted to the smell of handbags.
\"The child doesn't think the substance is bad,\" Lopez said.
“A large part of the attractive hand decor has just been scattered.
We offer mancs, grapes and orange-flavoured handicraft products that appeal to children.
The alcoholic strength by volume of disinfectants shall be between 45 % and 95 %.
A small amount of alcohol can cause alcohol poisoning.
“The alcoholic strength of the Käsides is very high,” said Stephen Thornton, the medical director of the University Hospital of Kansas’s Institute of Poisoning, to Fox 4 in Kansas City.
“No one would leave whiskey for children, but if they are often left to children, they will quickly receive a large amount of alcohol.
The six-year-old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four charms of strawberries in school, and the girl was delivered for first aid.
“The alcohol content of a girl’s blood was 179, which is double the adult’s humal limit, says the doctor Chris Ritchey Atlanta, who treated her from the Gwinnet Medical Center.
Nhajah was not able to walk when he was brought to the first aid.
Doctors followed the girl's room over the night in a separate kindergarten for brain damage, because the girl had fallen and hit her head after eating alcohol, Ritchey said.
\"Your account was really scary,\" Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and disinfectants in addition to the fact that your hands should be transferred to children’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are linked to death cases.
In 2013, two Ontario women died from swallowing gloves containing toxic substances that had not been reported.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter was reported to be the active substance in the summary of product characteristics.
According to the police report, three fourth-class students in the northern part of New York State planned to kill a brilliant teacher by placing antibacterial products around the classroom in January.
The teacher is very allergic to the hands and denied its entry into the classroom.
The police found that the lost plan was meaningless and called for the most disciplinary action.
Huhumylly: does not match in the lines of Celtic
Griffith refuses to match the Celtic team, while Deila admits that the team is not all right, but believes he will get the situation right.
Hearts blinds up against SFA for Neilson's punishment, and Warburton takes care of January's transfer to ensure that the team's unity is not affected.
Aberdeen neck in Celtic five points
ADAM Rooney’s first half-time punishment brought Aberdeen a scarce victory from Hamilton at the Pittodrie Stadium. The victory brought Aberdeen five points to a run in Celtic.
Griffiths' speech on dissatisfaction
Griffiths has bypassed rumors of the unrest in the Celtic lines. According to his own words, Griffiths and his team are not observable when preparing to meet the Dutch serial director.
“I don’t think we have any pressure, but I think the players are waiting for a meeting.
The Dutch need an old Scottish battler – de Boer
The former Rangers midfield player and Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have found that the Dutch football fans’ interest in Celtic has stopped because they are no longer allowed to follow the two campaigns between Celtic and Rangers.
De Boer, a team leader in Ajax, said: “There are no more highlights in Celtic games in the Netherlands.
Because Rangers is no longer involved.
We're not just talking about the Rangers' return.
We're talking about Old Firm.
The Dutch need two fights between the teams.
Old Firm's games have a huge tension, and they are also interested outside Scotland's borders.
For the sake of the situation, Deila assures
RENNY Deila admits that Celtic is difficult, but the Norwegian credit assures that the situation will change.
The club lost to Malmö fell from the Champions League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, which now has five points of leadership at the top of the table.
\"Celtic has had difficult episodes before, and we will rise again,\" Deila said.
“We want to target our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it raises anger or sorrow in many people.
So do we, but we need to keep going.
We urgently need support from Celtic supporters, as it strengthens players significantly.
Now it’s really important to be together.
Warburton
Although only a few weeks ago, the Rangers boss Mark Warburton suggested that he would be careful about the transfer of the team and that he would be willing to risk the unity of the team.
“In January, players’ transfers differ significantly from summer transfers,” Brentford’s former coach said.
“The players involved in the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the start of the season, which has been successful in our composition this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player acquisitions can cause more harm to the team than benefits.
Michu, who is thinking about retirement in the direction of Celtic
Swansea's attacker, Michu, has been linked to Celtic on the other hand, and Michu has suggested retirement after the end of the Swans agreement.
The bully of the 29-year-old Micchu has been a hateful ankle for years, and he was unable to get a transfer from Wales in the summer.

Neilson, however, remains behind his words. “I did not question honesty. I did not comment on the performance.
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths were beaten when a man admitted to his boasting songs about the former Hearts player Rudi Skaccel.
The incident occurred in the pub in the Edinburgh Roseburn area before the Edinburgh local match in Tynecastle in March 2014.
“There was a local match, and the mood was intense,” the attacker said. “I can guarantee that I will not go back to Tynecastle except in the lines of Celtic.

Unemployment is unchanged in Scotland, growing in the British Islands
The unemployment rate remained unchanged in Scotland in May and July. The unemployment rate in the United Kingdom increased by 10,000.
According to the UK Statistical Centre (Office for National Statistics), the unemployment rate was 5.9 per cent in Scotland, while it was 5.5 per cent in the UK as a whole.
The number of employees in Scotland is 12,000 less than three months earlier. The number of employees is now 2 612,000.
The employment rate of Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, with the average employment rate of the whole UK being 73.5%.
The Scottish Minister for Affairs David Mundell commented on recent figures: “The long-term management plan has created a foundation for a strong economy.
Almost a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to preserve as part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: and unemployment has decreased.
Why do I follow the execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if you do not find a legal basis for cancellation, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, what I do not wish, I will sit in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses.
In January, I received an invitation through a man’s best friend and despite my shock, I responded positively.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought I could tell this about the real story of the death penalty.
The perspective would be unique.
Suppliers will be able to track executions in the United States, and as applications are more than locations, participants will be selected with a macaber value.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of suppliers from 12 to 5.
The following executions are selected moderately.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossssip's closest friends. I've created a man's personal relationship, because we've been talking on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We laugh often when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I can't be there in both the character of the witness and the supplier, so I can't take notes and notes.
All I have to do is try and press on the details to my mind.
One of the Oklahoma journalists accused me of jeopardising impartiality on Twitter.
“The background idea is this:
When you tell the condemned story in a pleasant way, you get close to him.
I asked the journalist to separate my opinion.
The journalist admitted that he could have formulated his words more carefully, but still considers my actions wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't determine what I'm writing, and even if he tries to prescribe, I wouldn't obey.
I told him that he could remove me from the list at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist to be present who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity promotes the fight against the death penalty.
The Huffington Post journalist Kim Bellware will sit next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I am not going to repeat the details in this context.
I can't tell you that Richard Glossip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Trees, he would be assisted by the person responsible for the crime.
However, I believe that it is very likely that the man Glossip is not guilty of murder.
I absolutely believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I will follow his execution.
I can't say I'm totally impartial.
You can read an impartial description of other journalists’ stories.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die in vain.
The man was lured from the Canning River after a police hunt.
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry when attracting the man up from the Canning River.
The pedigree man's escape attempt to get into a low, muddy water, and a few meters away, the police got the man back to dry land.
The Canning Vale police got a call on Tuesday about an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
After arriving, the police found a suspect trying to punish the police by heading to the Canning River.
However, the man did not get far.
“The man standing in the water told me he wasn’t coming out of the water and asked the police to get him in the water, an older officer Shandell Castledine told me.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not attract the embroidery, so he chose a safer tactic – a negotiation.
\"Sometimes, an escape attempt makes a man resort to fun ways,\" says Sergeant Castledine.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is an interesting example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid the police blowing and tried to swim across Swan River.
The man’s attempt was doomed, but the pace encouraged the locals to design the Ben Cousins biaathlon.
According to Peter Moody, the players tried to spy on him, and he threatens to stop competing.
Peter Moody accuses Racing Victoria's agents of a spy company in their custody last year, and he threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that the service providers and Racing Victoria's Independence Department have personally attacked him, and the rejection of Lady Tatai's recently given treatment on the day of the race was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to work for racing. Moody was in a difficult situation when Lidar's sample found a kobolt, and the man couldn't explain the discovery.
Moody has kept his tongue under control of spying charges for one and a half years, and did not want the accusations to affect the actions of a bitter man.
“I didn’t intend to raise the issue, but I’ve been thinking about this for a long time, but sometimes the frustration breaks down with a one-off throw,” Moody said.
They know what really happened.
\"I have to respond and accept the consequences, and now I have to accept the state after I opened my mouth.
I'm gonna go home and sleep well.
I want to move up, and I want the horse owners to believe I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe in it, I'm no longer a horse coach.
I'd have to consider my future as a licensed coach.
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in the Racing.com interview where he told me about the impoverishment spying companies in his garage.
“A few months ago, Terry Bailey, Doyle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my garage to spy on my actions. I’ll tell him the name of the man when I ask,” Moody said to Racing.com.
They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If so, they should present the evidence, for I have not been caught from any unauthorized.
The former RVL president, Robert Roulston, current RVL president David Modee and RVL CEO Bernard Sandry, were aware of the action at the time and now.
Should I consider the situation as a personal driver?
Should RVL take real action and hold responsibility for the situation in the sector for non-trainers?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I really bad for the industry?
Perhaps many people think so.
Maybe I should still have a training license and push me out of my jobs, and I don't think that I can think of a lot of people with my words.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, it's sad.
It's really sad.
I push them to make their decisions.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw.
A long-lasting investigation of Lidar cobalts and a recent rejection situation led the coach to become frustrated in the end by threatening to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the unbeatable master Black Caviar. The man described the rules of treatment of the race day as ridiculous after the horse was set against the rules.
“The care is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for it, Moody said.
“The person in my family was wrongly putting clay on the horse’s foot.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done yesterday, and that's what happened.
But it happened on the day of the race.
Moody may be expected to be banned for three months from the treatment of clay against the rules which the organizers have started to investigate.
This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who does not know horses at all.
Everyone understands that the rules are needed, but here's too far, Moody said.
Deported from the Cobram Collar Place
The police have arrested a man who ran out of a cave in the weekend.
The biker was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital, and he got serious injuries when the car hit him on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the man who drove the car ran away from the place and didn't stay here to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia reported to the Shepparton police.
A person is likely to be expected to be accused of neglecting the obligations of stopping and assisting in a traffic accident and other traffic violations.
A 40-year-old cyclist from Cobra is still in hospital, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy refers to the push-ups of opponents
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy considers criticizing his team as a two-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six.
According to Coach Trent Robinson of Sydney Roosters, the judges gave Storm's wrestling to the hosts of Melbourne to win a card game in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett covered the gap with a reference to Storm Broncos won the Carncos in the Queensland Cowboys Saturday night. He called the game a model match and said that there was no more of a button in Queensland.
Bellamy was defending his team's game and said they were just focused on contact when they were fighting.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his team was added to the fact that the two top team coach criticized his team. Bellamy considers this to be a proof that the trainers worry about the loss of Storm.
“This thing always comes up, and I think Trent Robinson didn’t say anything about the button when his team won us on the 24th,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defense system or in our techniques all year round. Last six weeks we have only invested in the contact game and the fights that have turned us into an uprising.
Trent has been on his mission for three years, and the loss could have been a shock to him, because he has a great team that is not used to losing.
It is interesting that the same thing always comes up at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about what is interesting football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett St George-Illawarra Dragons won too in 2010 by playing boring football.
“Wayne is talking about interesting football.
He compared his team's Saturday game to our Friday game and considered their game interesting,\" Bellamy said.
“As a month, St Georgea received a lot of criticism about his boring game. Wayne said that the review would not stop him.
Now he has a team capable of playing so-called football, especially for his young, fast midget.
They want to play football when the player's arsenal is like this.
He highlighted this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play in his style. All teams have no midwives like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I get more self-confidence when other coaches are so concerned about meeting my team.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that the game Storm and Roosters made more paintings than they did when they met Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos' game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the result? 16-12?
The result of our game was 20-18. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are the footballs and small-scale footballs interesting?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably face them.
Storm has a free weekend, because the team will be able to visit either North Queensland Cowboys Cronulla Sharps next Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Serbian man free for $200,000 in drug cases
From a 40-pound cocaine company smuggled to Queensland, a possible life-long sentence has been released against $200,000 guarantees.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested in the last month after finding a hundred kilos of cocaine cargo on the Solay ship, which had come through the Vanuatu from South America and arrived at the Coomera port in August.
The police watched the meeting of Maximovic and a criminal officer in the boat port for the morning and surprised two later in the Coomera Roadhouse cafe. The Toyota Echo car was found in the parking lot was 40 kilos of drugs.
Although Maksimovicia may expect a lifelong possession of drugs for commercial purposes, a man’s lawyer says there is no evidence that his headman would have tried to get the whole batch over, but a man could have been in the cafe for innocent purposes.
According to Peter Flanagan, the Supreme Court judge, there is a risk that Maximovic is trying to escape the country.
“Maximovic clearly has links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, the judge said in court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about his place of residence.
The mother and stepparents of Maximovic paid 200 000 guarantees against which the man was released.
“After reading the evidence from both people, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them,\" Judge Flanagan said.
\"But it's not enough to stop a man's escape,\" the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he will deliver both Australia and Serbia's passport, will report daily to the police and stay home from night to morning.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to get pedophiles to send pictures
The pedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone to get over the pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone to the girl's sleep and signed up for an online messaging service where he made another user send inappropriate pictures of children.
Later, when she woke up, she noticed the phone disappeared, and she found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When explaining the contents of his phone, the girl found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
These five images were reported to the police. After examining the computers found at the address, the police found disturbing internet searches that have been used to search for inappropriate child pictures.
Hogg told the police that he was trying to lead pedophiles to a misinterpretation on the Internet and that he was presenting a police officer to scare pedophiles.
The prosecutor, Eilith Robertson, at the local court in Dundee Sheriff Court, said: “Man claimed to be dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had carried out his searches on the computer, but claimed that he had acted so as to present the police and thus to be able to scare pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about discussions with an unknown person who had sent him the pictures and asked Hogg for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his goal was to mislead pedophiles.
He told me that he had received disturbing thoughts when he drank and wanted to look at pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: “After finding the messages from the phone, the girl screamed at her mother, crying and crying.
The girl saw inappropriate pictures on the phone, and then Hogg was interviewed.
The girl told the accused of using the computer and PlayStation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg Dunden Ward Road recognised the charges of possession of inappropriate child pictures last June 14th. Hogg violated his release against guarantees on 25 January this year and refused to be entitled to a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defender Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed in the register of sexual offenders, which could be considered not to have contained significant sexual characteristics.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the declaration of the judgment to October due to the background reports of social work.
Hogg was granted an exemption against guarantees in this case, but he was held in custody for other reasons.
Hogg was added to the register of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe has the wrong speech in Parliament
The oldest African head of state, Mugabe, fell to the speaker's height on the leading stairs earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video was rapidly spread on social media.
Parliament’s opening objections to the opposition party’s claims that they have received anonymous killing threats, where they are being warned of being buffed to Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, the MPs took up and suspended the President's speech on the state situation in Parliament, and the president held the same speech on Tuesday.
Bishop Innocent Gonese of the MDC Party (Movement for Democratic Change) said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages calling them not to interfere with Mugabe's speeches.
“The message was sent from an unknown number, but the message’s title is “death,” Gonese told reporters after Mugabe’s speech.
The message warns the recipients that representatives outside of Parliament are no longer within the scope of immunity.
The party, led by Morgan Tsvangira, is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of business restructuring and savings.
HP will be divided into two stock exchange companies later this year and will distinguish from faster-growing business hardware and service activities of computer and printer business.
According to the HP statement, the company will record a one-off cost of $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter.
“Recommendations allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said the CEO, Meg Whitman, who leads the company after division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company of the current HP, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of transactions that will help companies move to a new business style,” Whitman said.
“As a company, our position is better than ever and we are better able to respond to the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual turnover is more than $50 billion and the company focuses on providing unique integrated technology solutions to companies according to its mission.
The company founded by the University of Stanford, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s, is now divided into two.
The HP has made massive restructures when traditional desktop computers are transferred to mobile devices.
The changes in HP, the world’s second largest computer manufacturer and the US’s largest technology companies, are the most recent transfer in the field that believes that concentration will bring success.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilsher that it is only September. If everything goes into a rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the field already in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to miss at least four English national teams, and the man’s history of his participation in the European Championships is clearly unclear.
The biggest problem of the last problem is that Wilshere decided strongly after the last season and seemed to have returned to his former blade during the new season.
“This kind of disability doesn’t threaten the career,” Wenger said.
“Lu didn’t heal well.
It's not a serious injury.
It was just an accident.
It was not associated with his ankles or previous injuries.
Medically, this can be the case, but as Wengerkin said, additional injuries can come when the player tries to return to the field between the season.
Here is also an unpleasant rule.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different types of effort since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played in the Arsenal lines only 65 in total of 157 leagues during the last five seasons.
The wider picture of Arsenal is that since 2007-2008, six out of eight teams have been the second most injured due to the loss of money.
Wenger accepts the potential witchcraft, but Arsenal believes that the recent injury statistics that improved in the past period will continue to develop in a better direction.
“The ability to return after the injury may be associated with a vulnerable period, in which case we need to strengthen the body and apply for a competitive election,” Wenger said.
Jack's young, so he'll get through this.
I hope he gets his body balanced, I believe in it, and with it, his career continues as he deserves.
Arsenal will start his master's league on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will meet Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on the next Wednesday. Wenger will prepare small changes in the composition.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be the starters.
Wenger can also put a start-up meeting in place of Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud's Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to take care of the balance of the team and give rest time to those who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite for the F-group, Maximir Zagreb has the scariest stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been unbeatable for the 41 game time team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night, when the country was suffocated with a power of 3.2 Richter.
The quake was in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his lesson in the past season since he is forced to bow to Monaco, and he is still motivated by a far-reaching desire for the team to be trusted towards the European Championship.
\"We have a huge energy charge,\" Wenger said.
“I haven’t hit this title yet.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, I am also realistic with experience.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truth about male friendship
A similar description shines out of their absence in other series. It is remarkable, especially when it is considered that the need for men to open is greater than ever, and the suicide statistics of young men are at the highest in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the most significant cause of death in the UK for men aged 20 to 45, and suicide is three times more common among men than women.
The Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) tackles the problem by declaring 2015 for men for a year. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In a recent study, 2,000 high school students were interviewed. According to a study, the chances of healing those with depression are better if there are enough healthy people around them.
The likelihood of the disease of people with no symptoms was also halved if there were people around them who had no mental health problems.
All of this is based on friendship.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and the communication style is often more important than content. Fast response is often considered more important than relevant contact.
With the digitalisation of life, the need seems strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is reality.
External values, money, imago and social status associated with superficial success. They all take attention to our inner values and natural personal growth and friendship. Internal values affect our mental health.
A millionaire in the video game industry recently said that money can’t buy happiness in reality.
The fineness of the Frends was that the series turned the focus on its head.
No one in the series's characters is defined by profession but by personality. This was seen in friendship relationships.
The series was humorously presented by Joey and Chandler, hugging or watching football with their TV chairs. We also saw Ross often looking for Rachel. It was clear that men could identify with this even though they did not refrain from feeling fully.
A volunteer worker explained this to me: “When I hear depressed and suicidal people, it has become clear to me how much the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
People who contact us often can’t talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should do well is strong. The man is easily considered weak if he talks about his problems.
“Frends are one of the series on which long-term survival mechanisms are presented.
In the series, small moments of male friendship were highlighted.
Through the phone, I can provide help from outside at a moment of despair, but long-term support will be provided from a close range of friends and family.
In honor of Comedy Central's FriendsFest, the stage of the series has been awakened to life. So if you participate in the event this weekend, you should take your friends to the coffee at Central Perk.
Or do something even better, smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can be.
Comedy Central sends the entire Frendit series – all 236 episodes – in honor of #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan, after painting Malmö.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in painting the Master's League debut and helped the PSG to hit the Swedish team on Malmö's Tuesday.
Read the game report and review.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were in shock when Paris Saint-Germain began his work in the Champions League by hitting Malmö Parc des Princes Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored a goal when the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. She confirmed the position of the French champions immediately in the hands of the hands. However, PSG pushed several finish points before they could finally add their lead: Cavani painted when the game was played for 60 minutes.
In Block A, Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also the same, so the PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG is not just pursuing a sequel in the drop-off games, but also wants to improve its positions for the quarter-timer in three remaining games.
Although SPG caught the points, the match wasn’t perfect for Laurent Blanc’s team screen. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the goalkeeper and the man was in exchange for his former home club, where he began his great career in 1999.
“It is not easy to win at home or in guests in the league of the champions, so the 2-0 wins and good odds give us a good basis, even though we still had to be disappointed for the season,” Blanc said.
This knows good.
I'm sorry we couldn't do one or two extra paintings.
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after he was injured. The team had to be satisfied in the 2 to 5 matches in the League 1 series against Bordeaux. However, Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in the shadow of four minutes.
Last month, the Argentine lawyer who moved from Manchester United to the lines of PSG was named the PSG’s solution to the team’s new level in Europe. He proved to be worthy of the name when he praised the ball by Marco Verrattt’s defence and then shot the exact target to the back of Johan Wiland.
However, those who were waiting for PSG’s crush had to be disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the fall games, marched to the field from the start of nine international players. The five men’s defense and the two attackers’ tactics were difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot was barely passed by Kevin Trapp's goal back-to-back for 34 minutes. The team did not attack very actively.
Instead, PSG fell into unnecessary feeding and weak finishing, not least Ibrahimovic, which lost five destinations only in the first half of the day. At the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick fed the paint to the potatoes Cavani.
Ibrahimovic, however, showed his fingertips in the feeder game. Di Maria shot the spiral kick by Wiland in 52 minutes.
The second goal was born at the time of Cavan, and the French player who played through it shot a full shot when Ibrahimovic fed him the left winger for Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's letter ended in another goal, and only Wiland's top defense from the close range of David Luis to shoot the shot was kept under the control, and the Ezequiel Lavezz's goal was abandoned at the end of the mileage.
Malmö created Åge Hareide after admitting that PSG was his own class. “We played the last Champion League game in December of last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
The gloves are not enough.
Hatunnot for the Parisians.
This was a top-notch game from them.
Glencore with a share of $2.5 billion
The Swiss mining waste Glencore, which was tested by raw materials prices, raised 2.5 billion US dollars in the medium-week share as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed in the London Stock Exchange, said in his opinion that he had sold new shares for about £1.6 billion in value to reduce debts.
The company’s market value decreased by 57 per cent this year. The company fell to a price drop in raw materials when the economic downturn in China is hampering demand and burdening the market.

The company sold new shareholders at a price of 125 penny, with a decrease of 2.4 per cent from the closing price on Tuesday.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares, up to 9.99 per cent of the total group.
Concerning the continuation of the Chinese economic downturn has led to the collapse of the price of iron ore, while the decline in coal, copper and other commodities has been between 20 and 40%.
White House Strengthens Xi Jinping's Washington Visit
The White House's Communication on Tuesday confirms that Chinese President Xi Jinping travels to the United States for a public visit at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives at his first official visit to Washington on September 25th, which is the opposite visit to President Barack Obama after visiting Beijing last November.
Following the bilateral discussions between the Heads of State, President Michelle Obama and President Obama will arrange dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan to celebrate the state visit.
“The visit of President Xi Jinping gives the opportunity to extend cooperation between the United States and China in a wide range of areas of global, regional and bilateral interest. At the same time, President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have the opportunity to make constructive discussions on topics that are controversial – the White House Communication says.
Xi Jinping’s visit was announced for the first time in February, and he is expected to spy in Seattle to meet several US leaders in the field of technology. From Seattle, the President’s journey would first continue to Washington and then to New York at the UN General Assembly on 28 September.
Obama and Xin are expected to address a number of controversial issues, such as Washington’s concern about China’s alleged cyber theft and the increased country’s activities in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon minimizes diversity in film production
Matt Damon was excited about talking with the African-American Effie Brown and said that there was no need for diversity behind the camera.
During the HBO Project Greenlight series on Sunday night, the actor stopped Brown when this explained how important it is to take into account the different views of the project’s selected screenwriter.
\"Moninity is taken into account in the role of the film, not in the role of the program,\" Damon said.
Brown was stricken and injured after Damon's comment.
Damon and Brown met with other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
\"Whoever is a director, I would like to encourage you to think about how Harmony's character is being presented,\" Brown said.
“The only dark-haired character is a prostitute who has sex with her white pimp.
The producer of the Dear White People film supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as the director of the film. Damon responded to the fact that the choice of the two could lead to a non-wanted outcome.
When the conversation was presented on television, the social media exploded from Damon's bad comments.
Twitter user Mr Poon expressed his anger at the scene in direct words: “The fact that Matt Damon is speaking over the only dark person to explain what the diversity is is is so white-sexing that it is painful.
This is more than 5,000 times, and it was liked 4,000 times.
Damon’s comments are at a time when a balanced representation of human races in the media is a number one.
After a teenager Michael Brown died of a white police bullet in 2014. The Black Lives Matter movement received support across the country. The movement seeks to stop discrimination against legislators and public authorities.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the year's album candidates in Grammy.
“The Albums still matter,” he said.
“As with books and the life of dark people, the albums still matter.
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement published an opinion in response to the question by Bow News Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether this group should be described as a hate group.
“Black Lives Matter is a group of love-based people,” the president said.
Damon is one of the entertainment artists, producers and mediamogues invited to the Pope to discuss the picture of the Catholic Church in the Western countries.
It is not known if Damon responded positively to the invitation.
American Ninja Warrior First Winner
The professional chipper and the container collector Isaac Caldiero took the first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and paid a million dollars to win.
For the first time in the 7th season of the TV series, all the assignments were investigated.
In the last episode of the season, Caldiero and the photographer Geoff Britten survived the final round.
In the last task, men had to get a 23-metre rope up to 30 seconds.
Britten was the first player to complete the mission in the first time. He was the first competitor to perform the fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior race approved. Caldiero, however, performed three seconds faster than the task and became the winner.
Caldiero told E!News that he was still in shock after taking a million dollars pot.
“The winning amount is amazing, because I’ve never earned more than $10,000 a year,” he said in an interview with E! about his winnings.
“Sometimes, I can’t even imagine what’s going to happen, the future is open.
The same producer Kent Weed talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Britten was not rewarded, even though he was the first competitor to have settled all the tasks.
“The fastest way to win the prizes is to win.
If more competitors find out all the tasks, the fastest to win, Weed explained.
“The prize for money is wonderful and transforms life, but Britten is also satisfied with its performance.
I don't think he's gonna miss it any more.
He's just happy with his performance.
He's got a lot of praise from the fans.
Britten is a great guy to which the family is important.
His child and his wife consider him a hero.
Geoff told me that because he didn't win himself, he would rather win to Isaac.
He also believes that Isaac would have thought the same about him if the situation had been another.

Detroit Tigers has won Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- Detroit Tigers has no special experience in the second half of the season.
Tigers, one of the best teams in Baseball, is now the last place in American League Central.
However, the team managed Tuesday by hitting Minnesota Twins on Target Field.
Twins lost his chance to get up at Houston Astros to fight the second wild card site of the drop-off game.
Detroit returned, though only for one night, the taste of victory, which has been behind the stone in the second half of the season.
“Every win is a good win, no matter how it is achieved,” said Brad Ausmus, the Tigers.
Tigers feeder Alfredo Simon held his surface when Detroit managed three times in the first two turns, once in the sixth and again in the ninth turns.
Simon (13-9) played 6 1/3 games and saved three runs.
He's only got three good beginnings on the ninth exit.
\"I just want to make a strong decision this year,\" Simon said.
“It’s hard to throw a ball in every game, and that’s why I want to feed it until the sixth turn.
The Tigers feeder's deputy, Victor Martinez, got three hits and hit two runs that were his first hit after mid-August.
It was the first three nights of the night of the Battle Mariners hit the Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
\"He hit me well,\" Ausmus said.
“He looks good at betting exercises and kept the line in the game.”
In the second turn of the 7th pair, Twins had the best chance of getting back to the game.
The middle cop Byron Buxton started the turn with two nests hit close to the left side line.
The right cop Aaron Hicks hit the sacrifice blow, and Simon took the second Brian Dozier, who took three straight baits before he replaced the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Herdy got a free nap for Mauer, and a successful feeder's replacement, Miguel Sane hit two nests, and then came on the right-hand Drew VerHagen.
When there were two runners in the field, VerHagen got the three of Trevor Ploffen to burn two players.
The Major League team led the 27th time this season when Ploffe burned two players.
When Detroit had hit the first round of the ninth round of the run, Tigers' finalist Bruce Rondon hit two runs, and the situation was between 5 and 4.
The right-hand feeder, however, threw three direct feeds and was able to keep his team in position.
Detroit took advantage of the fact that Phil Hughes was a little rusty.
Tigers received three runs with the first two turns against the right-hand consorts who had just returned from the list of injured people to the field. The man was on the side of the month for the back infection.
“At first, of course, it wasn’t like I wanted to, but as the game went forward, it started to feel more comfortable, and I was able to do good for performance and a few good feeds in the third round,” Hughes said.
After reaching the lead, Hughes gave one nest to the second Ian Kinsler in the first pair.
The real copric J.D. Martinique's free fight brought Victor Martinez the first shot of the game.
Victor Martinique's 0/21 pipe was interrupted when the team had players on the nest.
Nick Castellanos was next hit by one nest, one run, but Victor Martin was burned trying to move on to the third.
Tigers added his lead in the second pair, the kidnapper James McCann found out he hit the second nest and Anthony Gose's first nest, when the situation was between 3 and 0.
“How did you get,” said Twins coach Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he hit the right point.
On the pitch, Hughes, who fed a random third pair, then switched to A.J. Achter.
Three runs came into Hughes' balance, six hits, a free spindle, and four direct feeds.
Notable: Tigers' right-hand hitter Anibal Sanchez was not involved in the composition due to a blow-off.
Olkapää is investigating Dr. James Andrews who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured shoulder teares since mid-August and was scheduled to be included on Wednesday.
When Sanchez does not play, left-handed hitter Daniel Norris leaves the list of injured persons and is involved in the start-up meeting against the Twins.
Norris has been in 1 to 4 games since he was replaced with a left-handed hitter David Price on July 30.
He's been out of the assembly since August 20 due to a stroke of the stomach muscle.
Tigers and Twins decide their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, running height: 4,43) receives the right-hand feeder of Minnesota Ervin Santana (5-4, running height: 4,73).
Xi calls for the opening of the economy to the rest of the world
“The economic system must open up to the rest of the world to promote growth,” said President Xi Jinping at the meeting of the Economic Reform Steering Group on Tuesday.
\"China should commit itself to attract foreign investment and expertise and to develop economic opening policy,\" the President said at the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group to deepen the overall reform.
“By promoting the opening policy and deepening reforms to drive new points and vitality to economic growth,” Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted guidelines that included a negative list of rules on market access, mitigation of border control policies, the promotion of private capital involvement in state-owned enterprises and the revision of the registration system for citizens.
According to the Communication, a negative list of sectors and companies to which investment is prohibited is to be drawn up.
The system is gradually tested and developed through test programmes.
According to the Communication, this is a major change, as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, the legal business environment and the opening up of the market.
The government also reduces corporate supervision and I want to ensure that companies have a decision-making power over their own business.
According to the Communication, China allows the development of new cross-border cooperation models in border areas and the search for new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As a result of the opening up of the state-controlled sectors, many sectors open up to private investment.
“The administration does not change its foreign investment policy; it supports the legitimate interests of companies receiving foreign funding and provides them with better services,” the Communication states.
In addition, the application for a permanent residence permit is optimised by optimising the requirements and streamlined the search process.
The meeting also covered the right of lawyers to pursue their profession and to support judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and party leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
