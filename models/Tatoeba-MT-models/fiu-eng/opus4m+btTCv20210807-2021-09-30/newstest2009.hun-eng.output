The Prague Stock Exchange was minus at the end of the trading
The Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses after the morning collapse.
Transactions with shares of the Czech Energy Company (ČEZ) are close to half of the usual daily trading.
The stock exchange in Prague immediately continued to fall on Monday from the start of Tuesday’s trading, when it fell by almost 6 percent.
This time, Wall Street's shares are behind the fall.
The reaction of the market to the outcome of the U.S. House of Representatives' vote, which rejected the support of the stability plan of the financial sector there.
The Fall of Shares in Asia
In the Asian stock exchange, the dramatic fall of the shares was taken over on Tuesday, although the indicators eventually erased some of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange Index accounted for almost four percent during trading, but later lost some of the losses and reduced it to about 2.5 percent.
On the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Hang Seng China Enterprises Index fell by 3.8 percent, and markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses fell to 4.3%.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the index there, fell 3.6 percent.
“The timing of the American rescue operation is uncertain and affects the world’s financial markets,” Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, though part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. regardless of the central bank of China.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
According to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. legislators should start negotiations immediately and accept the financial support proposal.
In other words, it is a threat that other countries will understand the consequences of this.
The Blood Bath of American Shares
On Monday, the U.S. House rejected the draft financial system’s support for which $700 billion should have been spent (a mere 12 trillion crown).
The legislators therefore ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. shares experienced a blood bath and the leading stock indexes recorded the biggest fall in 20 years.
Dow Jones suffered a similar fall in 1987.
The index was already before the vote, but as it turned out that the proposal was not accepted in the House of Representatives, the index was released.
Congress withdrew: The U.S. government can pump $700 billion to banks
The chief executives of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed to provide financial assistance to the US financial system in the wider form of the agreement.
This will be voted for at the beginning of next week.
U.S. legislators have broken through the negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns) of financial assistance to the US financial system.
But there's no win yet.
The Congress must complete some of the details of the agreement before they can publish the final form and vote of the law.
The financial system’s support plan will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday he informed Reuters of the news agency Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Organizations Committee.
According to Senate sources, the draft is likely to be voted on on Wednesday as soon as possible.
Economists believe it should be reported that the rescue plan is approved, which is the first important psychological factor in the recovery of money markets.
However, as a result of the complexity of the mechanisms, there will be a \"repair\".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have taken a great step.
We have solved our different views about what should be the form of a package to stabilise the market,\" Bloomberg said.
He said the final vote would take place on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met Henry Paulson on Saturday night, the U.S. Minister of Finance, to give a final form of government.
This should be purchased from financial companies through unsold mortgage activities that cause financial companies to face severe losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We have a final agreement on a draft that will work and which must be effective on the market at the same time.
The repair plan needs to continue, but I think we're there,\" Paulson said.
Marking for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling heavily.
According to Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before trading in Asian money markets, where the Congress’s decision to trade on Monday could be the first to influence the time zone.
However, it is not yet clear that the two chambers of the U.S. Congress, when they vote on the law, as it is not, whether the trial could not be overtaken at the last moment because of some problem.
The legislators hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is going through a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
According to President Bush's request, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, the Congress may block the remaining amount of emissions, which was set at another $100 billion and later $350 billion, if it becomes a feeling that the program will not perform its functions.
Bush assessed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may oppose this decision, Congress may override its veto.
However, despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to acquire financial instruments for the acquisition of bad mortgage securities that lost their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgage loans.
“We’ve developed everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday, said Senator Judd Gregg Republican.
The progress made in the negotiations was also welcomed by President Bush.
Tony Fratto, spokesman Bush, stated that the president was satisfied with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated the two-party efforts to stabilise our money markets and protect our economy.
Restriction of bus terminals
Christopher Dodd, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said that the legislators agreed on responsibility for the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of discounts, and the timing of the financing plan.
The new law also limits the executions of the \"buses\" of the managers involved in the programme and creates a base monitoring committee.
The foundation should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We worked very hard on this, and we made great progress towards an agreement that will work and that will be useful to all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance to owners who have problems with the cancellation.
The government should create new repayments for the mortgage purchased by it, with the aim of reducing the monthly instalments of the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Spiritual Help
The proposed plan, David Marek, the head of the Patria Finance, says it is a good idea, but the implementation will be very difficult.
“It’s because you can’t know what mechanism the problem activities will be bought at and at what price.
This will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government share losses between each other,” Marek said in a week on iHNed.cz.
According to Marek, it is not so important that the plan is approved now or early next week.
“It is much more important that the Congress decide this week to support the plan and, as soon as possible, to give their blessing.
The importance of an agreement on the approval of the plan is the most important thing at this moment,\" Marek said.
Couple blade: MP3 players v mobiles.
We help you choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
This makes it clear that it is better to just buy a phone.
However, there are many reasons for you to get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the prospective owner.
It is probably difficult to get a high-quality record player at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on bagel plates, but there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if polcai is full of art rock, jazz or blues bagels, it is likely to dream of such a record player.
This is similar to traveling, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to publish eight thousand crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan is likely to find it difficult to accept a 20th crowned earphone.
Two extremes, among which everyone has enough space.
The choice is wide.
The life of the elements also counts
Some high-quality music players can do much more than simply playing music, but also what most of the mobiles don’t even happen to be.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Besides the primary features, calling and texting, you can play music and video, pick up both, have a better-bad camera, and even navigate.
And if you consider smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph.
Many functions have disadvantages as well.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more you send the display to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy addicts.
Few mobile devices can play music for a period of ten to twelve hours, mostly much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobiles, count that they won’t play for you for a few hours.
If you're even calling here, get a charger for your workplace for safety - this also applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will have no such problem, even worse ones will have at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one upload.
The next problem is to upload music to your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without any special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers cope with mini-space memory cards that are used in mobiles without adapters.
With a few exceptions (iPod) players, you do not need any special software.
Enough to upload the device from the computer with music via USB.
The majority of mobiles and players already create their own music library, the name of the album, the genre, or, for example, the user's assessment.
Some devices only represent a fast track like Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with an operating system).
Players are easier to handle, mobiles know more
When choosing specific equipment, ask about battery life, memory capacity, audio output quality and type, and of course comfort.
If music primarily serves you as a background and listens only for a short time a day, for example, any mobile playing MP3 will suit you.
Now, any cell phone can do that.
You don’t need to pay particular attention to what music formats your mobile or player can use.
With MP3, each will cope and most of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
MP3 is one of the most widely used, and the vast majority of devices also cope with WMA music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and iPod) occurs less.
Better mobiles also allow online music shopping.
Enough to visit the appropriate pages of the service provider (or other service provider) through the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service itself can be a strong argument for getting a musical mobile.
Unfortunately, the service providers’ supply is limited to poor and usually limited to only one summer radio camp.
Prices are not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that music will dominate the music industry in the future (whether through GSM, the internet or wireless internet).
Most people keep their mobile devices on their own.
Any time you want to listen to something, your cell phone is knocking out your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player is at home.
However, it still depends on whether you carry earphones or at least the speakers.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker with which almost all mobile players have only a few MP3 players.
Many music phones are likely to have the greatest advantage.
The cheapest are usually less than three thousand crowns.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get a fairly decent walkman.
Mostly, however, you are limited by the lack of traditional earphone output.
The best and most technically equipped phones can cost up to 17,000 crowns with traditional 3.5 mm diameter earphones.
The advantage of players is, however, easy to handle.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest players (see our selection) really cope with.
A minimum function, similar to a conventional tape taper or a gramophone, is evident.
There is no risk of collapse in the form of an accidental mobile Internet connection, and no subsequent huge account for data transfer.
What device to choose
The cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have openings for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
By buying the right card, you can access the maximum of two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can start with up to 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and even a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iiriver.
On the basis of the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not need to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you belong to a more demanding student, choose special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, making it easy to access the MP3 player.
In the industry, the fairest is Sony Ericsson, which has the same user interface as the separate MP3 players.
MP3 players can offer the same service in the same price category up to 40,000 crowns, but with higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will arrive in Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The Czech mobile market is relatively developed and our service providers offer practically the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, there is something missing for us here - a virtual service provider that imposes significant price reductions on classic service providers.
Maybe it won't be that long.
On the Mobil.cz website, we have written many times that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the ČTU, which pointed out that the price of sms in the Czech Republic was more expensive in other EU countries.
After the last step of the European Commission, roaming charges may be subject to a conflicting situation - Czech mobile service providers will be cheaper than domestic customers for some customers.
How is it possible that prices in Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound contradictory, because we have three mobile networks and our penetration is 100%.
On the contrary, mobile providers are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This is often agreed by Pavel Dvořák, President of the Council of the Czech Communications Office, who said that there is no place for another service provider in the Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classic service provider with its own network is no longer likely to have too many chances (it is probably difficult to find frequency).
But there is another possibility - the virtual service provider.
There was a significant drop in prices on the mobile market for virtual service providers, followed by classical service providers.
Meanwhile, even before the big fish market, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile in Great Britain, sounds like ours were heard.
However, it has been proven that such service providers have a place and can be truly successful.
However, for example, we do not need to go too far.
In February this year, we informed you about the start of the Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
This service provider has not been able to obtain more than 100,000 customers in a half year and become the fifth largest provider there.
Meanwhile, behind the Mobilking, the Penta Financial Group is the owner of the U:fon in addition to the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much narrower target group.
For efficient operation, you need much less customers than the traditional service provider.
There is no relatively high cost of construction, mobile network operation and maintenance.
Virtual service providers in the world are generally appearing at low cost – they offer cheap calls and SMSs, which are often offset by less service.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers at least 50 percent cheaper sms than its competitors.
But, as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland, it can also be a good move to a target group.
This service provider is particularly focused on men.
“The real men choose the Mobilking service provider, who likes the one they can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobil Entertainment Company that operates the virtual service provider.
It’s hard to tell if the idea like that in Poland can be resolved.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesperson of Vodafone, doubts: “The Czech market is relatively small to the segment approach on which most virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory for the provision of services.
In the Czech Republic, mobile service providers say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be the Mobileking.
“We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic, the negotiations do not seem to be too hopeful.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region,\" said Jana Studničkova, spokesperson of the Financial Group Penta in a telephone interview to Mobil.cz.
In other words, he demonstrated that existing mobile service providers in the Czech Republic were not overly related to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do their utmost to avoid creating any potential competition.
The GTS Novera Group has not been hiding its interest in the launch of a virtual service provider for a long time, which therefore intends to take another step in order to become a true competitor in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in providing not only wireless but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
The sooner, the better.
This option has been discussed again with all Czech mobile service providers.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations,” says Pavel Kaidl, spokesperson of the group.
Maybe better times are coming.
It seems from unofficial information that we may be lucky to the first virtual service provider by the end of the year.
His birth, however, is surrounded by a wall of impenetrable silence.
At this moment, we do not think that a full-value virtual service provider would have a place in the Czech market.
Unlike other markets, the Czech market is very special.
So far, we have not been invited by an uneven, complex and serious subject in this area,\" he mentioned to Mobil.cz about Vlastimil Sršeň, the Tefonica 02 press class.
The specific situation of the Czech market is also referred to by the other service providers.
Martina Kemrová, spokesperson of T-Mobile in exceptional agreement with O2, adds: “To date we have not recorded any viable and bilaterally beneficial business projects that could be further established.
He added: “In the T-Mobile network at the end of the year, it is unlikely that any virtual service provider would appear.
At this moment, there should be a specific agreement on our table to be able to think in such a short term.
Vodafone’s attention is more focused on fulfilling its 3G license requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: “We are invited to negotiate with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider the most affordable for our customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to develop networks shared with fast mobile Internet.
Responsible offices - a string with service providers
The procedure for mobile service providers is easy to understand, the entry of another provider would lead to an increase in competition, price reduction and thus to a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for us to enter such a competition?
When service providers are able to cooperate, they also testify to the huzavona around the birth of the U:fon.
The largest pressure on ČTÜ was likely to be around the birth of the U:phone of the T-Mobile company.
The information on this website is publicly available.
But right now, U:fon needs to be a good reason why we do not allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: “The environment for mobile market competition has recently been penetrated by the fourth market access of mobile service providers.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of a new player into the market and services would support high requirements.
However, given this attitude of mobile service providers, it is quite amazing that the Czech regulatory authorities are completely uninterested.
In the meantime, it is not only about the position of the ČTU, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, has the right to intervene in economic competition.
Only the Economic Competition Authority is entitled to do so.
But the office is characteristic of the whole problem.
\"A step towards a virtual service provider's mobile market would only be possible after a contract between a mobile provider and a virtual service provider is concluded on the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, since the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional service providers,\" said Kristian Chlapua, the External Relations Department of the Economic Competition Authority.
A statement thus made from the representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the office which should represent the interests of consumers and, apart from it, to ensure that no one can recover from their market situation, this is more than strange.
In particular, if Kristian Chalou adds: “In a country where virtual service providers usually operate, we can observe that their steps in the market have contributed to a decrease in the price of mobile services.”
However, the interests of the NEWS are likely not covered by the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and price reduction.
In this case, it is indeed shocking from the reaction of the three mobile service providers that can be very consistent.
The question is whether it’s just an accident, it’s almost self-evident.
As with the charging stations, the very same petrol prices are probably just the works of random and hard competition.
“The Office did not identify signs of anti-competitive proceedings in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the service providers have a leading position, i.e. no greater responsibility for the market's activities.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are likely to be missing in the telecommunications regulator,\" said Chalou.
Showing a leading market situation is one of the many debate points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTÜ, on the basis of which telecommunications is the sole market from the perspective of economic competition.
After that, of course, no Czech service provider is in a position of leadership.
However, some legal experts also offer a different approach - the approval of the network operator is always necessary for the creation of a virtual service provider.
And the mobile provider, relatively logically, has a monopoly on his own network.
So in a certain segment, it is necessarily dominant.
But even if we did not accept this argument, there should be a minimum incentive for UOHS to make three mobile providers appear to be acting in a similar way.
In the meantime, complaints from interested parties (including the GTS Novera company already mentioned) show that there are very similar obstacles in the course of the negotiations with all service providers.
Relief of responsibility for ČTÜ in telecommunications is a relatively common trick that the NEWs take off the whole case.
We've already met in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, the extension of the powers of the ČTU in the field of economic competition failed to pass through telecommunications, although many experts hoped to improve the situation.
This is what UOHS representatives need to know, but probably others have their interests.
It works when no one is listening.
Meanwhile, the operation of some kind of false virtual service providers that already operate in the Czech mobile networks remains unnoticed.
These are companies that offer their own mobile service price lists, but are only partially public.
It is a multi-level marketing company.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile services.
The price lists of these companies are usually only available to the selected ones.
Magic lies in the fact that the company is acting as a classic corporate client against the service provider, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a prominent customer, you will receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile service providers prohibit a similar promotion.
“If there were cases that you are talking about, it could be a breach of the terms and conditions that we would deal with and which could lead to the completion of cooperation with that company,” Martina Kemrová said.
But it is quite unlikely that news about such activities would not have reached the responsible people of mobile service providers.
In particular, for the three mentioned companies, it may be the case with thousands of customers.
In the meantime, no service provider is defending against such a procedure.
Because of the activities of these companies, they have no negligible profits and, unlike real virtual providers, they are not in particular threatened with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: “The law allows similar speculations, however, only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not on their name, so they cannot have a full range like the general customers of mobile service providers.
But that's exactly what the U.S. should be.
There is also another question for the NEWS.
If mobile providers close their eyes over a similar procedure, why prevent virtual service providers from being born?
It should be noted that the UOHS has relatively strong rights to expose such activities, and that if it does not, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that nothing like this has been established and that commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we are not the most expensive
As stated a few times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers on the mobile market has brought a noticeable price reduction in services.
Meanwhile, in virtually all countries where virtual service providers were established, the classic service providers tried to prevent them more or less.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, perhaps too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in the developed countries, regulatory bodies were involved in these moments, which in no way protected the interests of mobile service providers but their customers.
Then, even with formal measures or informal pressure, it was achieved that the first virtual service provider was created, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are giving each other the whole thing.
Based on our experience, we can’t get rid of the impression that unclear competences come well for them in these cases.
But don't give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is really coming up soon, the Czech mobile market may be re-moved.
If one provider would allow the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the NEWS will only be difficult to remain indifferent to reject further interested parties (discrimination).
And, compared to the rest of Europe, we may not be going to call more expensive.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the processing of the new version of the Czech state hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolán, on the day of the Czech State, solemnly presented the new records of my country?
The hymnist was recorded by the musician of the National Theatre under the leadership of Jiří Bělohláv.
There are four versions available - male or female solo, singing arm or instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The authors of the amendment of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
Bělohlávs consider the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymn.
The Czech Radio has been told before that he deliberately chose young representative singers to sing up the variations that are expressive and popular.
“Although from the very beginning, I tried to look at both of them, and later at the band, I tried to clean up, understand the text, and cohesive,” he said.
The Czech state's national hymn will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song “Where Is My Country?” was first silenced in the Rend Theatre in 1834 in the song Josef Kajetán Tyl Fidlovačka, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It was popular, and people looked spontaneously at it as their own.
The first verse of the song, after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, became a natural part of the state hymn.
After the formation of the independent Czech Republic, one of the seven state symbols remained.
What is the “new” hymn
The Prague Transport Company will deliver a chip card for the first time on Wednesday
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, you will enter the history of the Prague Transport Company when you enter the metros, trams and buses by the first passenger who will have an electronic coupon in your pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The coupon is currently available for about 100,000 people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy 30 days and 90 days, as well as annual coupons (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time save their chip cards in the information centers and offices of the Transport Company at Muzeum, Mṛstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
The coupons can be purchased online from yesterday via the Transport Company website www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until afternoon hours.
Those who start using the Internet trading can completely forget the metro stations’ publishing windows, where they had to go on a regular basis for line tickets.
The coupon can also be purchased via the Internet and saved on the Opencard card in one of the thirteen accounts of the City Library.
“In these places, passengers are offered a counter with trained servers who help the interested parties buy the internet and save their coupons on their cards,” said Martin Opatrný, spokesperson of the project.
In addition to libraries, electronic coupons can be saved on Opencard in self-service machines in some halls.
How do these machines look?
Reds, ticket managers, and passengers may have noticed them at Roztyly, Budějovica, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská subway stations.
“There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty,” he added.
The coupon is checked by automatic instead of the driver.
Their operation is easy to handle tomorrow’s start-up machines.
Enough to insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be saved from itself.
Electronic coupons are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
So on the trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, mainly the residents of the Central-Czech flights travel to the capital.
“On integrated trains in Prague, the fishing trips were provided with card readers, which also determine the area-by-sea performance of the coupons,” explained Philip Drápal, an organization that combines the timetable for public transport in Prague.
In buses around the city, card readers are installed at the manager's wallet.
In the event of entry, the driver must show not only the chip card, but also the Opencard should be placed in a location specified on the wallet side.
This is how the driver checks the validity of coupons.
“For example, if the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, the easiest way to ask the driver to do this, he added.
Passengers who do not travel by bus around the city and will not remember when their coupon validity goes down will be able to return to self-service machines that save coupon cards.
Information on the validity of their documents appears here on the display of the equipment.
The Saudis wanted a referendum from the United States.
The Sudanese Germans requested to join the United States in 1945.
This can be found in the letter that is in the collection of the South-Czech Science Library.
If we can’t be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the U.S. Patronate.
In 1945, a few groups of Sudanese Germans turned to the President of the United States.
This is also evident from a private archive that is currently held in the collection of the South-Czech Science Library.
In the letter, the Germans of Česky Krumlov ask the President of the United States not to allow the rescheduling of the ‘Sumavian County’ to the Czech Republic, which Hitler has already reserved on the basis of the Munich Treaty.
“We have correctly interpreted the situation and we really want to be sure in the words that American troops come to the German territories in no way as a suppressor and enemy, but as a liberator,” he said, “There are in the letter, ‘Embers who bear the fate of Šumava in their hearts, signed by words.
Since the annexation to Czechoslovakia is supposed to give the Germans, in addition to the knowledge of the Czech national character, hope only for brutality, mercy, not understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the President of the United States to take over Šumava the protatorate – now and forever –
“We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million inhabitants, this area would be judged as a foreign country that would suppress and overthrow the minority, and would not contribute to the victory of allies with nothing,” he said.
The reason the authors could not sign, it is alleged that the fear of revenge for the “cash suppressors.”
If, therefore, the President of the United States said to doubt in the opinion of the Germans, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the County of Shauma, whether the inhabitants want to become part of the United States and if they want to live under the U.S. occupation.
Although the text of the letter may seem somewhat naive in addition to the current knowledge of post-war history, some historians say it reflects the expectations of the Saudi Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to have minimal suspicion that they would be displaced from the country, only a few of them could be recognized.
Some expected that the United States and the Great Britain would agree on a kind of autonomy for the Saudis.
Again, others were confident that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalova, Austrian journalist born in České Budějovice.
Chaloda served as a German in Budějovice during the war in the Baltic Sea.
When the British were captured at the end of the war and taken to the Holštynsk prison camp, dozens of other Czech Germans came to teach them Czech.
“They trusted that when they came home, they needed the Czech language well,” Chalou said.
Of the German prisoners in Czechoslovakia before the war, no one calculated to be expelled from the country on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think, you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks leaders
In Czech history, the most expensive action to ensure the safety of roads.
This would be the way to describe the media campaign on emotions that the Ministry of Transport is planning to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš śebíček's office from this campaign hopes that he will scare the leaders from the dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The 150 million campaign will be on television, radio, cinema, the internet, but it will also appear on flyers.
Leaders should be alerted to speeding and alcohol.
And you should also remind them that their safety belts are being stacked before they start.
First and foremost, young drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians, and not least the conscience of professional drivers.
What is displayed in advertising?
Emotional, primarily human stories.
It is also a slogan for the whole campaign:
You don't think, you pay!
The term “don’t think” on the plate is written in large letters.
And in the blood bag, the word \"pays\" is written.
This must be a symbol of the fact that man can pay his life for a moment of neglect.
The viewers are scared until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns from the English countries, where dramatic images of victims of accidents can be seen regularly.
It is hoped that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The promotions were made by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Pull it, put it on the drivers.
“The driver’s system is valid.
For example, “make them” are when they go through the red, saving time.
The danger of a punishment or accident.
The driver should be reminded of the risk,” says Martin Kořán, a transport psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need the information campaign in the press, especially the negative campaign, the psychologist thinks.
According to him, the attention of the driver is less effective.
“If the hazard warning board is equipped, it is likely that it will soon coincide with the environment and the leaders will not deal with it,” Kořan said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmer, President of the Provisional Israeli Government, spoke of the return of practically all areas occupied in 1967, i.e. the western coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and Golan Fennsík, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He said this in an interview, published by Jediot Achronot on Monday.
“We have to deal with Palestinians, which means that almost all of us, if we don’t have to give back all (incarnated) areas,” Olmer told the daily newspaper.
“We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but the Palestinians have to transfer a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He acknowledged that any return would include East Jerusalem.
“He who wants security in Jerusalem and, in particular, wants tractors and bulldozers not to go through his feet, as one of my best friends have done, must give up part of Jerusalem,” Olmer said, referring to two cities in July, during which some people were killed and a few dozen were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution to “the Temple Mountain, sacred and historical places” in the Old Town.
“The one who wants to preserve Israel’s sovereignty over the whole city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work, he stressed.
Out of Golan Fennsík
Olmert also expressed an opinion on the withdrawal of the Israelis from Golan Fennsík, which, in his opinion, is an indispensable condition for the peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would require some effort from Damascus.
“I do not recommend a peace treaty with Syria only on the basis of the departure from Golan,” he warned.
“The Syrians know well what they need to give up so they can get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollahhal (Sympathy Movement); they must provide regular support to the terrorism of Hamas (Sympathy Movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (Sylen War) in Iraq,\" the Prime Minister explained.
Questions after an accident: Are passenger escorts illegal in buses?
The law does not know them, you should not walk on a distance bus.
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency, the question of whether passengers and passengers can travel on the bus was raised near Italian Padova.
“If we were to strictly and formally comply with the law, the passenger’s activities are contrary to the legislation on transport activities,” says Karel Hanselka, spokesperson at the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, the death of a twenty-two-year-old passenger is likely caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus.
The girl was sitting next to the driver at the moment, the bus was the least safe place, although there were two other places for her.
The bus may collide or suddenly stop at the moment the passenger attendant serves coffee or offers newspapers.
There is a question of whether the bus is standing according to the traffic permit.
If the bus is not homologized, passengers must sit.
Student Agency's distance buses have no standing places; confirmed by Radim Jančura, the company's director.
“We tried to find a solution to this ministry, and at first the movement of passengers was not allowed.
However, this was withdrawn and we found that passengers could go to the toilet during the journey, if they had their own seat,\" he said.
The law does not know the passenger attendant.
\"There is no clear legal framework on the role of the passenger attendant - no legislation governs this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the provision of services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of the driver; it does not define his rights and obligations, making it less evident to Hanselka spokesperson.
Josef Pokorný, the director of the Department of Road Vehicle Operation of the Ministry of Transport, on the contrary, believes that the law properly addresses the problem.
“It depends on whether or not the bus’s traffic license is in place.
And it's over,\" you say.
Buses can be, on their own, urban where they have standing places and are limited to maximum speed, and with city-to-city stops and allow higher speeds, as well as distances without standing places and at maximum speed, with seats with safety belts.
As on the plane, the expert says.
Jaroslav Hořín, a BESIP traffic safety expert in the movement of passenger passengers on board the bus, sees no fundamental problem.
“In the course of continuous progress, there is no danger, and the situation can be compared to the service on the plane.
You can’t be sure when there’s a turbulence and the flight attendant can beat his head.”
“If the bus suddenly stopped, of course, its physical laws will apply.
Same as in city buses or trams.
The safety of passenger passengers must be resolved by the carrier with internal rules,” says and also believes that the problem has not been resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to terminate services
The Student Agency offers passenger services as a single bus driver.
She employs two hundred passengers.
After the accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
“As I have the impression that the occupation of passenger attendants is risky, I will also end it.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by passengers when they arrive.
That would be cost savings,\" he said.
In his vehicles, safety interests were justified by the lack of passenger attendants, Alexej Litvin, director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of flights compared to Student Agency.
“We don’t have passengers, we’re against this from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it ends up with some deadly injury,\" Týden.cz told Týden.cz only a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
For two years, a young passenger attendant from Plzeňi, who worked for the company, died during a trip to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably pulled out of the stop bar without using the direction indicator and stopped the bus.
The bus driver suddenly tried to get out with a manpower, but the front end of the bus hit him.
The fact that two reserved places for the rest of the passengers were also sold, Jančura rejects it.
“These places cannot be booked for long distance flights, blocked”
The company wants to sue the driver of the truck.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency is not waiting for the court's judgment, but the financial compensation is expected from the guilty.
A legislative amendment?
The Far Future
The clarification of the movement of passengers passengers on board the bus could be the amendment of the law, which has been working for more than a year by the thirty-pronged expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
However, the group did not achieve any concrete results.
Buses are not so much, rather the point system deals with maximum allowed speed on the highway and during driving mobile use,\" Hořín says.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of passenger attendants as a basic threat to the safety of passengers,” Hanselka said.
The Dusseldorf Hopes are Over in Frankfurt
The letter to the bank’s staff of the Board of Directors of the WestLB is not limited in the words of the bank.
From the unity of the units of the Düsseldorf financial institution and the association of the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt, the central capital market organisation of the savings fund fund group could be established – the letter published on Monday.
The WestLB would take a long-term profiting “complimentary block” into a business like this.
Such a relationship could give the decisive boost to further concentration in the provincial banking sector.
This reads when a board wishes to prove its ability to act in difficult times.
In fact, the unstable WestLB bank continues to be under tremendous pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which has recently been aware by the North Rhine-Westphalia Province government that the time limit for finding a lasting solution is tight.
However, it has been a long time since the relationship between Deca-Bank and the WestLB on the basis of the investment funds.
Franz Waas, head of Deca-Bank at the end of August, at the end of the half-year data, was aware that the bank in Mainzer Landstraße and a provincial bank, such as Helaba or the WestLB fusion, did not see its meaning.
Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of Deka, one half of which is representatives of the provincial banks and the other half of the savings fund associations, has instructed the Board to continue negotiations with the WestLB on joint business activities.
In this case, the capital market business or certain parts thereof may be involved.
However, the negotiations, which have already begun, have already begun.
With 3,000 employees, the name of Deca-Bank, which is one of the most important employers in the financial sector in Frankfurt, will not first arise in terms of consolidation of the savings storage sector.
For a moment in 2003, Deka-Bank seemed to be joining Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, there was nothing from this three alliance.
The plans were barely published, the Hessen Province Government spoke against Helaba's interest.
The two banks did not find each other.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, instead, was transferred to Stuttgarti Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
Again and again, however, the idea of the relationship between Deca-Bank and the provincial banks has been raised.
Last time, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Helaba, spoke against the plans for mergers with his bank.
However, it is worth recognizing that there is a need to approach the different banks of the sector.
Now, following the regional elections in Bavaria, BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg are expected first.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure on additional wheates is increased, the potential partners may run slowly.
In South Germany, only a younger business partner would be able to overcome the financial crisis significantly better than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
The fusion with WestLB was excluded at the beginning of the year by Giroverband Hessen-Thüring, with 85% business in Helaba.
The NordLB is better off.
Such geostrategy considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question is how different business models of each bank fit.
Merl said in June that the German Association for Savings and Jews has not yet answered the crucial question of what kind of business model should be provided for the future of provincial banks.
Finally, it can be imagined that there is still a bit of WestLB, which they do not want for themselves.
Thus, the letter of the board there states that they are, in any case, seeking a “full solution.”
How this can be reconciled with the unity of individual units with Deca-Ban is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the weekend of Italy.
This is the third or fourth time Luca has.
But now Elena's here as her girlfriend, and so everything else, Luca says.
Behind them, the Kaiser branded five-liter barrel consists of a strong-bodyed bearded man, proving to some 200 people who travel to Oktoberfest how deep they can pull out of their throat.
Elena first makes Luca's face, then kisses her.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus station next to the Puorta Nuova train station, four buses depart at 23.45 p.m.-destanazione Monaco, paints the della area, with a view to arrival at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly held up by the Italians, and in the fourth, only Brazilians travel.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans have already been singing alongside their flags, they have already started celebrating during the night.
And so loud that it's not for the Italians,\" Marco Guarda says.
Buses are owned by Marco with a long, artificial coat and a wide silver-haired eyeglass.
He's been traveling to Oktoberfest for five years, only organised three trips this year.
At 2:30 p.m., the Oktoberfesten is home.
The hotel would mean only unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The road costs €75, which includes the welcome Kaiser beer, the accident insurance and the German-language tour - Marco Frankfurt, a German language course.
Buses are already in the direction of Brennero in the night.
No beer, not yet.
The bus quickly silences, the passengers sleep.
All right, they'll still need their strength.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, many Italian buses take a short break before Munich on motorway 8.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half a week, there are nearly 50 other buses coming from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco will hold another final announcement, explain the plan of war.
First, everyone pick up the yellow cap.
On the left side of this page, the inscription “Oktoberfest” can be read, along with Marco’s travel agency’s address: “conoscersiviaggiando.it”
Secondly, “When the doors of the brewer are opened, the jogging – Marco shouts into the morning.
“Foutage – Recruitment of places located in the rear of the tent.
“Not in advance, for we are stuck, and not on the same pads all yellow caps, but on the tents, let us spread out.”
The single-litre basket costs €8.25 and screams Marco.
And don't forget about the tip.
“Show the security guards that you are well behaved.
As soon as you leave the places, they will be taken.
Third, “Be here at 6:30 a.m. this evening – you understand?
And we're on our way to the Wiesn.
On the way, one of the men's guides will bind yellow hats to trees, boards, and even to the election poster of one of the great Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for the retreat.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as “the weekend of Italy.”
There are no accurate figures; they talk about 50,000 people who cross the Alpokon in the beer bars, all visitors of the weekend are reported to arrive in Italy by 10%.
The Munich police are confirmed by seven South Tyrol police officers, Italian volunteers are helping the Bavarian Red Cross, which in its national statistics, with approximately 200 medical supplies, Italians occupy the first place, preventing the Austrians (about 80) and the low-level British (about 60).
Among the Italians, Hofbräu is especially fond of beer.
Dreamless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system was relatively stable, stressed by the Federal Minister of Finance for Peer Steinbrück just last week.
It is a good thing that the politician used the word “in proportion” and even said that the German banking sector was not spared crisis-like developments.
Because it happened this weekend.
Daxon’s registered Munich Hypo Real Estate (HRE) real estate finance company received a billion dollars loan from the German banks’ consortium to protect itself against market distortions.
A person who knows the situation said on Monday with Reuters that credit subsidies were fired at EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate must pay interest only after the part used.
The money is partly from private and partly public banks.
In the background, Depfa’s subsidiary losses are in place.
Depfa, acting on state funding, has borrowed money for long-term projects and has refined itself for a very short period of time - which is no longer possible because of the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserves decreased by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million and the share of own funds decreased moderately from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
The current income and net revenues from the money companies fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, with revenues from claims credits and specified securities and from the liquidation of the credit business's reserves falling to more than EUR 5 million by more than 70 percent.
Only after the conversion costs of the former Depfa group had a relatively moderate revenue deficit of 16%, due to higher revenues and the reimbursement of interest rates under the tax ruling and the transactions of the companies belonging to the Consultant.
After privatization in 1990, the former state finance manager first speculated with corporate real estate loans, which later became separate at Aera Bank.
Since the classical public funding could be limited, Depfa has been more strongly involved in infrastructure projects and private investors and public-public partners, PPPs, and has expanded its activities internationally.
For the value of subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate has now to make descriptions that are “effective” to demonstrate the results of the group, they have been reported fairly generally.
In fact, no dividend payment was made.
The dividend was reduced to a third by 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure financier since Depfa was taken over.
In comparison to other financial institutions, the interbank market refinancing is more dependent on the fact that it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the lending of banks between each other was lost, as banks maintain their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets to refinance part of Depfa’s credit portfolio – around €50 billion – annually.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the financing needs of the group are covered for a period of time with the loan, and the company is protected from the influence of highly inefficient international financial markets.
According to other sources, the financing is secured by the end of 2009.
In contrast, Mr Funke, the CEO of HRE, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group does not have to use the financial markets for a foreseeable period of time.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bafin) see that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now guaranteed.
This gives the bank its shareholders and creditors hope.
But due to the dynamics and inaccuracies of the crisis, they cannot be certain.
It is not even possible that funding should not be fully used.
But the opposite of that cannot be excluded.
After the late Saturday news said the bank was still on the brink of bankruptcy, it was not even a temporary rescue that could calm down the springs.
The share price dropped by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, the bond rates are quite good.
While the first-place debt is barely changing, the exchange rates of the reverse-ordered bonds have fallen significantly.
In particular, the crisis affects former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo’s bonds and, as a matter of fact, futures beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds have previously been a speculative investment alternative, they now have to be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system as a result of the expansion of the banking crisis and as a result of the fact that the financial institution has taken the crisis almost to the house by taking Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and the less endangered business banks are still ready to support the system, they can be based on the time-limit for the repayment of the subsidies.
Or it will happen where no one is afraid to hope that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, the likelihood of partial nationalisation has now become just a legitimate recession.
For long-term lenders, it can cause dreams of the decision to withdraw from their investment.
However, short-term investors can make use of the sale to provide a reserve for taxes on the exchange rates of the coming years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the inside box
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce himself to the Tachibana High School on the first day of teaching, the girls begin to whine: The German girl is a total-to-go.
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word about manga - in the new exchange blog, she tells about Japan.
“The first day of teaching in Japan.
I was very excited.
I was on my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo, towards Kavaszaki, and travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, and I'm lucky I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachiban does not seem to be taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to scream from eight hours until a short conversation starts with the teacher, the “home room”
But before the teaching started, I had a line to introduce myself.
I am not the type of person who would like to speak to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had my school uniform yet, I picked up my housewife's old skirt, added a blouse, a blue knee suit and a black leather coat.
So I stood in this dressing room before the cathedral and tried to say everything correctly: “Sajonara, no Sylvana, I am called Sylvana, I came from Germany, and in a week my birthday will be my birthday.
At this moment, I was very happy to learn the language for two years.
All 31 girls were whispering, whining, and waved, and I always heard the word.
I already knew that from my manga.
This Japanese girl belongs to the basic vocabulary and means \"sucky, sweet\"
Then I fell into my place quickly.
The girl sitting next to me smiled widely, and it was an honor to have been planted next to the replacements.
The rest of the clock was quite quiet, but when the bell was spoken, they were running out of order.
Everyone spoke and laughed, and with their questions they drilled a hole in my stomach - and it is quite difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
At the break, everyone packed their insides.
My hospitality also made me such a lunch - this is completely different from the boring German ten-hour sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, little sausages, cucumbers and alkaline salads, fruit and a kind of tofu roasted meat.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Foods look weird and have a completely new taste.
In fact, everything is very fine.
Well, maybe, except for salty butter, brr.
In Japanese schools, the inside is not just just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy her own hand-made bean, which is especially made up by artists - in the hope that she can get closer to the boy during the lunch break.
I read about this in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can observe this here.
“Why, Japan, my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
\"Because you're just charming...
After all, I’ve been reading manga for many years.
And to understand more about the comic books and the culture described in them, I began to learn Japanese at some point.
It was very clear to me that I had to go here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to traditions and habits.
And they're very proud of you here.
Japan is, on the one hand, a country of latest techniques and trends, on the other hand, a strict, disciplined and traditional one.
And since everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost, even if Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life.
The rats also have emotions.
A rat or a mole is in danger. Is that what it means to be afraid?
Joseph LeDoux’s neurologist is convinced that animals also have emotions.
But how can you see if you feel the same way when you behave like us?
In the “Edge” online magazine, scientists have been publishing their articles for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in one of the series \"What it takes to be real without proving it,\" she looks at the answers to the question.
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness without being able to prove it to me or anyone else so far. It is true that we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of every human brain is the same.
However, as we examine other species, and in general, we break the questions of consciousness, we come into a difficult field, because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he pretends to be a dead person, he flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, resulting in comparable subjective experiences by some researchers.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to take over our subjective experiences.
On the one hand, human consciousness-related circuits almost always contain the secondary prefrontal brain (in short-term memory and the role of implementing/control functions).
This wide area is more advanced for humans than for other primates, and seems to be completely missing in other organisms.
At least in the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal brain, for example, the consciousness of who we are, or, in the case of design and decision-making ability, it is reasonably assumed that man is different from the other mammals.
A further dramatic feature lies in the language of man: Since a significant part of human experience is related to the language, it is often said that this depends on consciousness.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
However, even if it does not depend on language, the language would certainly affect, so the animal consciousness, whatever kind, is likely to differ strongly from most of our state of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine what consciousness may be like in the case of other animals.
If consciousness cannot be analyzed as an internal and subjective matter, and because of the special hardware, we cannot be analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then his research puts us in serious trouble.
Most of my thoughts relate to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be more accessible to science.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in the case of experiments on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, during this assumption by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely more on the neural connections of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both can be the same or not.
Interestingly, this assumption also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal brain to create visualization.
What comes from this emotion?
This is driven back by the fact that an emotional system, such as fear, is activated in the brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we call fear is therefore the mental state in which we are in when the activity of the protective system that is localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) takes a work memory.
In this way, the emotions are closely linked to the areas of the brain cortex that are characteristic of the primary mammals, and in particular of man.
In addition to language, the perception is divided into fine stages, because using words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize the condition and categorize them in addition to ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damascus believes that emotions come from simpler activities of the brain and brain stems, as well as Jaak Pankeep, who is more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can easily play a role in the overall emotions of species.
I can't clearly explain this, but I think it's unproveable.
Panksep believes that what seems to be fear for rats and humans in both cases is likely to feel: How can rats and people feel the same when they behave the same way?
A roach escapes in the event of danger, does he feel fear too?
In my opinion, only similar behavior is not yet evidence of the same experience.
Although neural collapse will help us further: rats and humans have a similar brain stem, the cockroaches have no brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for emotions?
And even if this was proven in terms of humans, how can we prove this in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even the roaches (who knows?) have emotions.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And since their emotions are likely to be fundamentally different from ours (which is based on special circuits of human consciousness and language), I am researching the emotional behaviour of rats rather than emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is narrowed at the neural level, if we measure the same in rats and humans.
As for rats, I don’t study language and consciousness, neither do I feel because I don’t know if they exist.
This may seem to be a short-sighted attitude to others, but I’d rather go forward rather than constantly collide as a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Platini, Chairman of UEFA: Time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vassjunik said that preparations will soon be held under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government sees confidence in Ukraine in UEFA’s Bordeaux decision and evidence that Ukraine is able to organize the European Championship together with Poland,” Vasjunik said.
“This does not mean amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun, and there is much to do in both countries.
With regard to the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both host countries are failing.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums is reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste more time.
“We have to work with a tightness now,” said Grigorij Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Association.
“UEFA will keep us in mind.”
They were even more radical in Poland.
After several scandals, the National Olympic Commission suspended the Polish PZPN alliance, which was replaced by independent supervisor Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission agreed on the initiative of Mr Drzewieck, Minister of Sport.
“The risk is that PZPN is unable to operate according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish POP news agency.
“We assured Michel Platinum, the President of UEFA that this would not adversely affect the preparation of the EB in 2012.
Only in the last season had to be classified into the lower class because of manipulation, and finally, the league had to be postponed.
The Disgusting Dennis Quaid
The actress wanted to advertise a new movie, talked about her privacy in the interview, and now she's in trouble with her ex-wife.
The one who claps - and cuts back
The late rosary war at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex married couple: The two Hollywood actors fight a terrible fight seven years after their divorce - before the public.
In an interview with the American InStyle magazine, Meg Ryan said for the first time last week about the reasons for the divorce: “Denis has long been unfaithful to me, causing a lot of pain.”
And only after the divorce, he knew how many women Dennis cheated on him.
It was because of Ryan’s new press work on the film “Women,” which tells the story of a divorce.
Dennis Quaid responded to the cry of a disbelieving husband: “It is terrible,” said the 54-year-old actor New York Daily News, “that Meg is unsatisfied to repeat and spend the story of our relationship.”
It is also “unfortunate” that 16-year-old joint boys, Jack, are repeatedly reminded of much pain and change caused by divorce to a child.
While Ryan has been living alone since divorce, Quaid has grown up again and recently became the father of a twin couple.
Therefore, the answer is closed with the following side cut: “My life will continue anyway.
I am happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is all right.
Flight ticket and hotel room prices decrease
In the first half of 2008, European flights and hotels were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, flights in Germany were less than 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and hotel room rates have become more favourable again – so it can be summed up as a result of a study by American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed its first half-year booking data and established a significant price drop in the second quarter after the first quarter price increase.
After prices on the hotel market have risen for years, many hotels have become cheaper.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities examined increased by an average of 6.9 per cent compared to 2007.
However, in the period from April to June, prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most clearly shown in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is that American Express sees the low exchange rate of the dollar, which led to “the low rate of travel of American tourists.”
The decrease in hotel room prices affects financial centres such as Frankfurt or London, such as industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
A 26.3% increase in hotel prices in Norway is a European record.
There has also been a growing change in the prices of flights in the first quarter.
Due to the kerozin's gliding, passengers had to pay more in the tourist class than in 2007, while long-term flights with high fuel demand were charged 29.2%.
Between April and June, the prices of passenger class flights decreased by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but prices in the business and first class showed a much lower change.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9 per cent and decreased by 23.6 per cent in the second quarter.
According to the study, the cost of domestic flights in Germany decreased to half.
The reason for the price reduction lies on the one hand in the slowing economic growth - the company claims.
The airport market has weakened demand in many segments.
On the other hand, as a result of the Open Skies Agreement liberalising air travel between the United States and Europe, the pressure on competition will be strengthened.
The tense situation proves that airlines cancel their losses flights and a number of airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe are affected.
HSV 1:0 Blood Gladbach
A goal and simple methods led to the tabella in Hamburger SV.
In Borussia, Luhukay will still not be able to find a working team.
Kristoffer Klein magnification Deep fly for the national selection of Marko Marin.
The gladbach player was only late to play, and the lifting fell back from the gate.
His message clearly left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
\"We need to go to the second goal,\" Hermann Rieger said.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the break ended, and most of them sat in their place again.
For nearly three decades, Rieger has been a Physiotherapy of the HSV, having a greater authority than a few gamers in Hajdan.
His request for a hearing was found in the competent place.
Cornelius Jol rang and showed his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the son of a Hamburg coach, Martin Jol.
His command was similar to that of the second goal.
The order has not been executed.
“It wasn’t always a beautiful sight today,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt also imagined it – more clearly.
The result of 1: 0 (1: 0) can be attributed to the head of Mladen Petri in Hamburg; and the condition that the very weak gladbachians could not cause pain to the weak hamburgers.
“It was a great victory,” said Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV is now 121 years old on Monday.
The viewers celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena, and the display table on the exhibitor, which showed their team as the top of the championship.
It's gonna be a birthday without a party.
“We know where to put it,” Marcell Jansen said.
The fact is that the mutual certificate of the tabella indicates the incalculableness of the league rather than the dominantness of the HSV.
Although the team has been engaged late - the Brasil Neves and Silva, the porter Petric and the FC Bayern - thanks to Jansen, he finds himself slowly, but is not yet in the market.
\"We need more sense and clarity,\" Jol said.
After the landing
Wall Street is surrounded by fear.
Due to the first news on the failure of the rescue package, Dow Jones temporarily dropped 700 points.
This was the biggest score in his history within a day.
Later, the Dow was stronger.
At 20:30, the world’s most important stock exchange barometer was at a good 5 percent minus, and stood at 10.579 points.
With technology papers, Nasdaq fell to 1548 points with more than seven percent minus.
The Dow’s biggest loss at this time was the American Express with a 14% loss, followed by the Bank of America with 12 percent.
None of the papers got stronger.
Goldman Sachs bank shares have dropped almost 10%.
Only a few days ago, he bought a bank share in Warren Buffett as a big investor.
In the context of the rescue, resources are intended to be made available to buy so-called two mortgage papers.
However, the amount will not be paid at the same time, but will be paid gradually.
In exchange, the State would receive the shares option vouchers of the financial institutions, which would be settled in the event of the proper developments in the exchange rates, reducing the burden on the state portfolio.
The European and American and Stock Exchanges
The billions of aid to European and American banks do not dispel investors’ doubts.
The share price of the German Grand Bank is falling and grabs Dax with you.
The American Dow Jones indicator is falling despite the planned rescue of the financial market.
Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank’s spectacular exchange losses deeply hit the minus German stock indicator (Dax).
In spite of the rescue operations of the federal government and private banks, the value of the real estate financing in Munich has fallen to the fourth quarter, the Commercial Bank has weakened by more than 20%.
Dax is a psychologically important threshold of 6,000, and recorded 5839 points with a 3.7 percent minus.
Stock markets have been forced on the ground all over the world.
Wall Street opened in New York with a significant loss.
Investors are afraid that the US government's $700 billion rescue package will not be enough to drive the money markets.
Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trade, i.e. 3.3 percent to 10.809.25 points.
The U.S. House wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote could take place on 1 October.
The rest of the European stock exchange is only known for one direction: in London, the FTSE index showed a 3.2% reduction, the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei Index sank by 1.26 percent to 11.743,61 points after initial reinforcement.

Sal. Oppenheimer registered 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist brand also said that Thomas Cook shares are not sold.
Dark material affects the flight of space probes
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing dissatisfaction among researchers for years. Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity cannot be fully correct.
The \"Ulysses\" spacecraft flew in space for almost 18 years.
Because of the soon-breaking fuel pipelines, ice cream threatens.
Among scientists, for years, there has been confusion with a mysterious phenomenon, swing-by anomalia.
Swing-by is the gravity of space probes, during which a celestial body, such as the Earth’s gravity, is acquired for additional momentum.
So the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe also used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
However, what has been the point of the researchers for many years: flying objects are not fully behaved as expected under the ancient Gravity Act.
Instead, disorders occur in the speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have found no explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was baptized as a swing-by anomalia.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity can not be entirely correct, which is the mass draw of the material as a curve of the space.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to believe that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by anomalia with the so-called dark material discovered by the astronauts in the universe.
“For anomaly, dark matter can be responsible, which may be found even near the Earth,” says Adler.
Only ten years ago, the space searchers have learned about the existence of dark matter.
It is obviously a gravitational force that can be observed by the impact on other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, i.e., no electromagnetic radiation, especially visible, does not release or beat the light back.
According to scientists, a good one-fifth of the total mass of the universe consists of dark matter.
Tourists who have been kidnapped in Egypt
After ten days in the prison of their kidnappers, tourists in Egypt were once again free, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs confirmed.
Sudanese kidnappers demanded millions of euros of ransom.
In the shooting prior to the release of the hostages, six hostages were supposed to have lost their lives.
Five German citizens were kidnapped in South Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are underway.
Again and again, they become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports the most important cases.
European tourists in Sahara are free.
This was also reported in Egyptian state television, Al-Arabiya’s Arab TV and Italian media.
According to reports from the Italian Sky TG 24 television operator Franco Frattini’s Italian Foreign Minister confirmed the fact of release: “Our experts and other hostages were released.
We are currently examining their health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian citizens, as well as eight Egyptian escorts, are healthy and safe – reported by the Egyptian state television.
19 participants of the desert expedition are supposed to be on their way to Cairo.
A Egyptian security officer said that the hostages had already shown willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army killed them surprisingly.
“The problem has been solved.
The ransom was accepted,” the official said.
“It was only about taking over the hostages, when suddenly it happened, “the surprise.”
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers on Sunday in the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two.
The hostages demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money should have been transferred to one of the hostages' German wives.
The “al-Masri al-Jom” daily newspaper, referring to a German mediator, reported that the release of hostages is being pulled away because the kidnappers are concerned about their own health.
According to the report, hostages release women's hostages after the ransom fee is paid.
Men are held captive by kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a stand on the report.
“It has led to suicide – the violence in the United States
He said in court that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather raped him for years.
The Cornwall County, Stithians, spent 57-year-old Michael Trerise in prison, after a statement of eight-time rape rape attempts.
The Truro Criminal Court found out that she regularly signed up her stepdream, Stephanie Randle, between the ages of five and seven.
In a statement from Trerise, he wrote: “I feel responsible for his death.
The trial said that at the age of 34 Randle, he was killed in the home of the city of Mutley, in the district of Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her eyes and tied her eyes in front of her marriage, while her mother worked in a beer shop.
Trerise left his wife in the 1980s, and was re-elected by Cornwall.
He moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it turned out that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust Memorial Organization, was persecuted by the nightmares of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who was passionately fond of surfing and cycling, said his friends, “the emotional dead and said about life.”
In April 2007, his father Terrance Randle found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle was confounded with his daughter’s stepfather, who finished his testimony in a letter saying: “I have always tied up my eyes and closed my eyes.
I was not sexually harassed.
I feel responsible for his death.
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You’re a very strange fetish, and I’m sure it was awful for his victim, especially when he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim killing himself.
But even more thoughtful is the fact that if it did not, the case might never have been brought before the court.
The judge added: “I call attention to the impact Stephanie’s parents felt on their crime girl over the years.
If it didn’t happen, it would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman.”
The official who lost the important data has been charged
According to BBC reports, an official secret breach is charged with the government official who has strictly forgotten secret documents on a train in June.
The man was sent out from the Ministry of Defence when he left two strictly secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the simplest charge of violating the law, and there is no suspicion of deliberate crime.
Frank Gardner, a BBC Secretary of Defense, said the move surprised a lot of people in Whitehall.
“It was believed that the Ministry of Defence and the Government would treat the case as an internal matter,” he said.
The employee who cannot be named was charged on the basis of point 8.1 of the Act. This paragraph is about the preservation of information.
The Public Prosecutor's Office proposed that the accused of the official be charged with the work of Metropolitan Police, which was rather sensitive to the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included secret surveys on Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
On Monday, the decision was notified and moved to an unknown place.
The apartment building cooperatives pay the B&amp;B account
The UK apartment building cooperatives can count on an invoice of more than 80 million English pounds after the release of Bradford &amp; Bingley Bank.
The government spent £14 billion to protect its deposits at Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of the depositholders, including 59 housing cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, President of the Association of Housing Buildings (BSA), “it’s annoying that companies and members have to pay.
Refunding the 14 billion important loans will eventually take place after the return of Bradford &amp; Bingley's mortgage.
However, in the meantime, interest is charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use loans.
The Financial Services Compensation System has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 apartment building cooperatives are among them.
It is annoying that institutions that have been cautious so far must now pay the accounts of institutions which were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We knew that each company had to pay in proportion to the amount of deposit that it owns. Companies share 18% of the costs among each other.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the loan will reach £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies have to lose 81 million pounds to pay the interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, the head of the department of housing companies, told the BBC that he thought the measure was unfair.
“It is frustrating that the institutions must pay the accounts of the very less cautious institutions which have been cautiously in the time of the recovery of the housing market.”
According to the BSA, no company has been destroyed since they started operating in 1945.
“In all respects, we have to look at this case in the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from a significant account,” Cole added.
Interest due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, you will have to pay a full annual interest rate, which can be even twice today.
Since housing cooperatives are self-help organisations, without shareholders, the members will eventually have to pay the invoice, either through higher fees or through lower interest rates after their deposits.
Milk prices rise with five pences per liter
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The dairy company in Jersey announced that it would increase the wholesale price of milk by 1 liter from Monday to 5 pences.
This year, this second price increase has been due to the rise of two penny in February and the survey carried out by an advisory company.
The resellers themselves decide whether to reverse price increases for consumers.
Before the rise in February, the retail price of Jersey’s milk changed last in 2002.
Requested by a former member of the Parliament of Bangladesh to defend himself in liberty
The Bangladeshese court rejected the request for protection of former parliamentarian Sheikh Hasina in a patent, which means they can arrest him when he returns to the country.
His lawyer said that the court refused to defend him from the patent on the accusation that, at the time of his parliamentary representative, he was blackmailing a businessman for $50 million (729,700 dollars).
This is just one of the countless allegations of corruption against him.
Sheikh Hasina's former political opponent Khaleda Zia was released this month.
Sheikh Hasan must return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but his party, Awami League, demands that the provisional government supported by the country's army give him full freedom first.
According to the reports, although they were conditionally free to go abroad for medical treatment, the conditions for free footstools do not clearly determine whether they can maintain their freedom when they return to the country.
Lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the appeal court.
“The appeal court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s request for bail that it is not necessary, since it has already been temporarily placed on the foot and is taking part in foreign medical treatment, we learned from Rafique-ul Huq’s lawyer.
“We will appeal against the decision of the appeal court.”
According to his lawyer’s arguments, he needs to defend himself in the free house so that he can return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after 17 October.
Last year, he was arrested for taking over the power of the military-backed provisional government, but in June he was released from prison to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Concerns on the Afghan polio vaccination programme
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 Afghan children have left the recent polio vaccination program for Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations has organised a vaccination mission in six provinces.
However, they said that for security reasons they could not reach the children living in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.
According to a UN spokesman, this happened despite the Taliban's promise: they will not attack or prevent the work of thousands of personnel who have been vaccinated.
Rejected the BSkyB appeal on ITV
By rejecting BskyB’s appeal against the Commission’s decision to reduce its interest in the rival TV, ITV.
The Court of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
Previously, the Committee concluded that BSkyB’s shares hinder competition and renders unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought its share in 2006 and effectively prevented NTL - which has been renamed Virgin Media since then - in the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority announced that BSkyB’s share of ITV’s ITV’s ITV’s independence would be at risk by encouraging the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin Director Sir Richard Branson, Consumer Groups and Ofcom are all opposed to buying.
The BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in ITV’s share was an unreasonable and disproportionate compensation, in particular in view of the BSkyB’s statement that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation of the U.S. prosecutors' case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the loss of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The step followed that the report on the case, prepared by the Chief Justice Commissioner of the Judiciary, criticized the decisions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators and former state prosecutor Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was fear that the state prosecutors were lost from political consideration.
Nora Dannehy, a special prosecutor, will now investigate whether the officials who have been heard during the investigation have attempted to interfere with the judiciary with lies.
“The serious charges for possible crime have not yet been investigated and have not been clarified,” says Glenn Fine, chief inspector.
One of his main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor whose authority was to make witnesses testify.
The series started in December 2006 with nine state prosecutors removed from the U.S. judicial office.
At that time, they said that the state prosecutors were released for their weak performance.
However, later it turned out that the state prosecutors had no worse assessment than many other colleagues. Therefore, many have concluded that political consideration was drawn behind the dismissals.
Some state prosecutors participated in the criminal proceedings of high-ranking Republican Congress members, while others refused to take part in investigating allegations of electoral fraud against Democrats.
The U.S. prosecutors are investigating the government and conducting court cases.
They can be lost at any time, but they cannot be removed from their position for political reasons.
At the time, Alberto Gonzales, the chief prosecutor of justice, has become a target for the losses and has finally resigned.
A number of other officials have also resigned.
In the report of the chief inspector, Gonzales has greatly criticized the role played in the case. According to the case, the main prosecutor is “principal responsibility” for dismissals, “declared” leadership roles, and “excellently removed himself from the process.”
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former assistant of the older Bush, have been judged not to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf
The rock star Meat Loaf will be awarded the Q Awards award for the \"Bat Out of Hell\" episode.
The singer who takes over the special gold prize next week at the London celebration said he was honored.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second song Meat Loaf was a song titled album titled in 1977.
Coldplay received the most nominations for this year's awards, and four categories of candidates were included in the list.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and “Bat Out of Hell” like this.
Jim Steinman’s song called for a very big sound, and that voice was Meat Loaf’s.
The song began with an almost two-minute musical profession.
He appeared as a single in 1979 and reached the 15th place on the Slagerists.
However, the album Meat Loaf-Bat Out of Hell was present on the Slagerists for almost nine years and then sold more than 40 million copies of it.
Meat Loaf - a real name Marvin Lee Aday - is currently struggling with health problems. Among other things, in 2003, due to his heart rhythm disorder, he was undergoing surgery after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel a few concerts due to acute gel inflammation.
Later it turned out that cyst was found on his tone.
Unknown city street, often forgotten, and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of Avenues, Tours, and Other Sideways, some of them have famous, others with a purely practical function.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long-term local residents could find it difficult to tell where the Extra Place is, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village and is heading north from the First Street - without reaching the Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 9 m wide and 36 m long, and much more like a dusty alley than a main transport route.
There are no street boards.
You can hardly find it on a standard map.
However, the street has admirers.
There it is, for example, Avalon Bay, the building of the newly built First Street luxury buildings.
He wants to redecorate the Extra Place and make sure that he can get to the shops and boutiques of the new buildings on a cleaner path.
The admirers of the street belong to the long-term neighbors who were caught in the bone street that it was the only remnant of the past before the renovations of the surrounding area.
However, the owner of the street, the building conservation and development department of the city, is not in the interest of insisting on it.
This month, the representatives of the city and Avalon Bay presented a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer the street to remain in the management of the city and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, Susan Stetzer, head of the municipal council of number 3.
“There are very few areas in the city and we want Extra Place to remain in the city,” he said.
“They may come to the zone with proposals for renovation and treatment that may be made by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee that the public will be able to remain available to the public.”
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that he would like to redecorate the small street, and he would like to have a seat. Some of these would be used by a coffee shop, which the construction company would expect to rent a place.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not insist on possession.
“Avalon Bay’s main point is to renew this flattened alley and turn it into a pleasant public helly,” he added.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Building Conservation Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office was tasked with the development of buildings and not the management.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, the Extra Place does not have much historical significance.
Some say that in 1802, Philip Minthorne was named “the land of his house,” when he was divided into several children and no one was in need of the narrow ground.
The pop-rock monument closed in 2006, the back exit of CBG was opened to Extra Place, and the street may be the most popular one that was taken on the cover of the Ramones-Rocket to Russia album.
“It was a great place,” Danny Fields said, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
\"You had garbage, clothes, barrels and posters, and wooden leaves and ropes.\"
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how the middle class owned East Village, opposed the sale of Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, whatever it is, should remain in the community.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rare, which is a practically unchanged piece of the city and which must be left at peace.
Jeremiah Moss, author of the “Jeremiah’s excellent New York book, Siralmak: The bitter nostalgia of the city’s extinction process – subtitled) posted on his blog a part of the story about Extra Place, published in 1952 in the series “The New Yorker” entitled “The New Yorker”.
The author Brendan Gill wrote: “The Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end, which is still dark during the day, surrounded by rusty, iron-made storage doors and spallet windows, and where the wind carries one-week newspapers in the channels.”
The street, apart from some exceptions, looked the same way a few nights ago.
A rat runs across the street at the end of the street, next to the back door, which used to lead to CBBBB, and now belongs to a high-priced clothing shop.
On the walls it was graffiti, and an empty, 0.75 liters of beer was lying next to a drop of fresh paper.
Some visitors told us that they rarely remember the Extra Place, but they think the renovation would be appropriate.
Fields said that some people underestimate their attraction in the current state of the street.
“I’ve spent the most beautiful years of my life in dark, wet and disgusting places,” he said.
Debate on bilingual Education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
In this section, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the opinion of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an experienced researcher in California’s studies in the Pacific Public Policy Research Institute and head of education research, is “It’s not as good as you think: Why a middle class needs a school choice” book co-author.
It is not easy to welcome voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are also included.
According to Obama’s campaign, “the African-American and Spanish-speaking students are significantly less likely to get a degree than white students, and that’s true.
In order to overcome such performance differences, Obama’s education plan explicitly supports, among other things, the “temporary two-language education” for English students.
At the same time, the question for Obama is whether its commitment to two-language education, which places emphasis on school education in non-English, is beyond its interest in tackling high performance differences.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep contract general school in the east of Los Angeles County.
Most students of the school have Spanish lips and low incomes.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, learn English.
Nevertheless, 100% of the fourth graders have achieved excellent results at the 2008 state mathematics exam.
It is equally impressive that 93% of the fourth graders have completed excellent English language and literature exams.
This incredible performance is not achieved by the tool Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street places emphasis on repeating, exercising, assessing skills and rejecting objections.
In addition, and this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels, Director of Sixth Street, the school’s educational principle is the “full baptism of English students” in the language environment.
The essence of the method of baptism is the almost exclusive use of English while teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes the two-language education, said: “We have had a tremendous success in the fact that if someone walked into a classroom, he wouldn’t notice who was the student who arrived 12 months before he arrived from Mexico.
\"It works,\" he said, \"we work,\"
Will Obama set up other schools that teach a significant number of Spanish lips and English students as a follow-up example?
The results achieved by the school should be clear to make the answer, but because of the education policy of its own party (the National Educational Associations have long supported the two-language education) and, as we ourselves are consistently speaking in addition to two-language education, we cannot be sure of Obama’s reaction.
Although he agrees that immigrants need to learn in English, Obama has recently expressed his appreciation for the question when he said that people shouldn’t be so concerned about the lawmaking “definitely English mist”.
Instead, he said, “They should be able to speak Spanish to their children.”
If Obama really wants to achieve a decrease in the differences between the results, you should seriously study the models that work instead of looking down and neglecting them.
The price of oil fell steeply due to the renewed concerns of the economy
On Monday, oil prices were steeped due to concerns that the American financial markets’ rescue plan would not be able to awaken the economy.
The stock of crude oil fell seven percent to $99.80 a.m. on the New York Trade Exchange.
Prices have been reduced by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the stock exchange has been shaken by the Wall Street financial confusion and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached USD 145.29 per barrel in July, the price fell to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month before the impact of the immense uncertainty of the financial markets was restored.
On Monday, the concern reinstated investors even after the Congress’s leaders announced that they managed to agree on the economic rescue operation, which is the largest ever in history.
The news has been shadowed by concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for a long time.
At the latest events of the emerging crisis, Citigroup will buy the Wachovia Corporation banking business, the government announced on Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
According to the Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of the desperate weekend negotiations, it seems that the rescue operation failed to revitalize the trading advantage of the stock exchange.
As the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for goods, such as oil, is expected to decrease.
“The future of the stock stocks, interest rates and exchange rate markets worldwide has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank wrote.
“We think that the market for goods will not be avoided by the “ epidemic”
The biggest question for the stock market is the extent to which the U.S. disease affects the whole world, in particular China,
As the slowdown in economic growth has led to a decrease in oil consumption, the bank analysts have fallen from their expectations for the next year, reducing their oil and gas prices by 20% by 2009 forecasts.
With the second quarter of the team's record
After spending more than eight seasons in the Jets field than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, who was in the defensive position, thought he had seen everything.
But then he looked at the launch of the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets turned a game without a point into a sensational match.
“I haven’t seen this before,” Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the game of Jets and Arizona Cardinals was fully aligned with the dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre, a quarterback 12-yard touchdown pass, gave Laveranues Coles a perfect premiere for an afternoon during which their co-operation was significantly further developed.
Favre gave Coles two touchdown passports in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks fell ten seconds before the end of the half-time.
“I didn’t feel sorry for the effort,” Favre told all the Coles about his pass.
“He’s a good player.
We have been able to communicate well with each other, regardless of what people think.
While Favre and Coles balled, the defense stopped Cardinals' controller Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis caught a bad throw and threw it back with 32 yards, which reached touchdown.
Eric Smith, a security player has reached another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, the linebaker managed to kick Warner's hand out of the ball.
This could have been the most amazing game in the game.
However, when Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end, and the Jets acquired Jay Feely’s 20-yard field to kick, thus setting the 34:0 result.
This was the best result that the Jets has achieved in a quarter of a year.
When asked for the coach of the Jets, Eric Mangini, to characterise the mind-breaking character of the game, he said: “The second or the third quarter.”
When he was told that both of them, in the third quarter, Cardinals scored 21 points that Jets did not get one, Mangini said: “I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
We've got a lot of points in a short time.
The rest of Gebrselassie’s world record is over.
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many consider it the best middle and long-distance runner ever lived in Berlin when he broke his world record on Sunday.
At the convenient plane track, during the time of 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds of the earlier result of 2:04:26, which he achieved in Berlin last year.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set up the 26th World Records of his career in so many areas that he has won world championships almost all over the world from 1500 meters to marathon, or has won world record.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon, which, looking back, may have proved to be excessive caution - that air pollution would further exacerbate his asthmatic problems.
Instead, he entered the Berlin marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - during the day, initially at 9 °C, and at the end at 13 °C - won by Gebrselassie Sunday, an incredible speed of 2 minutes at 56 km/h.
Since the marathon’s previously non-starting runners, such as Gebrselassie, and the Kenyan Paul Tergat turned towards the longer term, the marathon record has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won the result in Berlin at 2:06:05.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago, he was stuck on his feet and could not train for two weeks.
It is clear that during the forced rest, it was refreshed and not fervent.
“I’m so glad,” Gebrselassie told reporters.
“It all worked out perfectly.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had doubts, but finally everything was fine.”
He received some criticisms, especially from Kenya, the Eastern African rival of Ethiopia, that he uses too many aids during his competitions, usually avoids many world-famous marathon runners, claiming to his Irish runners that he would run on the track and place world records in front of the spirit of competition.
However, this criticism hardly reduces the magnificence of Gebrselassie in the long run.
On Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the peak by 1:02:04.
Two cutting-edge Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the iron runners got tired.
Not much more than 4.8 km before the goal, Gebrselassie left Kwambai with a last sprint, who reached 2:05:36, 5 minutes to improve the individual's best.
Kamathi came in third at 2:07:48.
In the female competition, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now German citizens, closed a remarkable year with the seventh fastest victory of 2:19:19.
The World Summit is held by British Paula Radcliffe with 2:15:25.
In the past spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London marathon with a result of 2:24:14.
Due to the alleged back injury of the Beijing Olympics, he was quickly healed and won the Berlin marathon, where he improved five minutes on his individual peak. This was the third marathon's distance run on which he participated.
He won the race with a reasonable count: first he allowed a group of four people in Ethiopia and Kenya to break ahead and take a major lead and then come after 30 km.
Ethiop Ascale Tafa Magarsa was targeted second by 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop in Kenya became the third by 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and attempts of black people
The Greater Orlgone experience park - a few miles away from everything that shines, loud and mighty - is hiding a quiet small town where the pride of African American life and its complications were born.
Eatonville, the first purely black town that was integrated into the country, and which was the home of Zora Neale Hurston’s childhood, is no longer as simple as he described in 1935: “The five lakes, three croquets, 300 brown skin, 300 good swimmers, a lot of guajava and two school cities, without prison,
Now it's a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, and Ruby Dee have been attending the Zora festival each year. The eatonville celebration series is held in honor of the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance, Hurston.
Yet, in many respects, the city that it described and made tourist attractions, which is also included in the Florida Travel Book published by the Federal Writers of the Crisis, is separate from its surroundings.
It was as independent, dignified and closed as it was in the 1930s, when, according to a written by Hurston, Florida, city blacks were often not willing to share their real thoughts with white people who were “so little aware of us that they did not know what they were left behind.”
Even in the year when the black presidential candidate Barack Obama encourages an open exchange of views on the racial issue, many here are untrustless about the looks of outsiders.
“We take great care of how to tell our story,” reports Hortense Jones, 59, who lived here all his life, and is a member of the oldest church in the city.
“We need to tell you a little bit,” he said.
Eatonville has long been characterized by the paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of black exit, but it is a community of almost 2400 people, where poverty indicators reach the double of the national average.
Partly a literary node, partly as a result of the American slavery, sometimes looked down, sometimes praiseable, southern, urban, black culture, flourishing in the shadow of the oak trees.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the residents here are proud and vulnerable at the same time.
The picture from Eatonville has been important since Zora (this is what everyone calls Hurston).
In the books written in the honest, strong dialect, such as \"Mules and Men\" (1935) and \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\" (1937), he presented his hometown to the world.
The Florida Travel Book has transformed the city, which is located next to the 17th road, and this road leads from the ancient center of Florida to one of the sites of the history of blacks and human dramas.
Hurston, who was brave in life and literature, even the drummer, introduced his readers to Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke's business, and then looked into the more confidential spheres.
He wrote: “From the road we find the modern public school, on a brown basis with a white segment, carefully maintained courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller cares about, although he can hardly write and read,
He made a reminder of the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn sells all sorts of drinks and whatever might be needed in temporary accommodation.
Thus, in a few hundred words, Hurston brought Eatonville into contact with autonomy, but at the same time with unwrittenness, remarried and sex.
It is clear that the Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
This description really didn’t like everyone.
\"Zora said things like they were,\" said Ella Dinkins, a 90-year-old girl, Johnson, who made them immortal by quoting from the synamolic songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added: “Some people didn’t like it.”
Hurstonra here is still remembered as the elite for special occasions, who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville in Florida.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston went to the city, he usually arrived in Chevrolet without notice, smoking cigarettes, and in the long-sleeves of a city where people are still proud of their dignified dress.
Most of the people were charmed, he said Franklin, but many were tired of it.
\"People were always happy to see Zora,\" Franklin said.
However, on the terrace of Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added in his chair: “I’ve never stayed for too long.
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were no longer published again.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with much of the world, forgot about it.
Although he was once a popular writer, Langston Hughes's contemporary, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he lived before.
In Eatonville there were no significant monuments or great public readings.
“I don’t think they understood how much he enriched the world or what he left us at all,” said Valerie Boyd, author of the book Hurston, published in 2003.
The turning point came in 1980.
The officials of Orange County wanted to build a five-track road through the city instead of the two-track main street, instead of the Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the life of the community.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated Interstate 4 motorways on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still walking after a difficult historical period.
Among other things, forced integration has brought an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggles of racial blending have tasted hatred with the community.
“A large group of white boys came over and threw themselves at the side of the road with oranges and other things,” Franklin said.
“There was a lady who died in this.
They threw a Greek dick out of a car.
In a letter to the \"The Orlando Sentinel\" in 1955, Hurston questioned the decision of the Supreme Court on violent integration.
Today, the residents say that the degeneration of schools was positive in some respects, weakened the unity of the Eatonvilles and undermined the confidence of young people.
“Black children are used to killing them – I remember - the man killed his teacher in the morning and night,” N. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins, chief executive director of the nonprofit organization called the Eatonville Community.
“It took time for students and teachers to come from a common place,” he added.
“We didn’t hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher – I mean, there were cultural differences between us,” Nathiri said.
However, human rights have helped many other Zora Neale Hurtston rises – in black writers, actors and artists who have been superior to prejudices, as he has done, with confidence and lines of confidence as follows: “How anyone can deprive himself of the pleasure of my company!
This is inconspicuous to me.
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to restore her reputation.
Five years later, the bookstore was placed on the shelves of a famous Hurston biography written by Robert E. Hemenway, which re-examined America’s role models.
The road construction project would have started just when Eatonville’s most famous girl again came to the centre of attention.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors looked at him as a savior.
In 1988, the community began to organize a Hurston festival to show what would ruin the county with its main roadline.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many have been returning to the celebration every January.
A few years later, the county resigned from its road construction proposal.
“Because of the five expansion of the main road, the community was relived, connected to the full speed, which represents a real civil pride,” Nathiri said.
Boyd said: “Zora saved Eatonville.”
The victory over the road construction project helped change the image of the city itself.
There was an increasing number of people outside the city, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to go to church in 1993, and the locals began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National History List in 1998.
In 2006, the new single library (naturally named Hurston) was opened, the rebuilt and built on Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville continued to be Florida's cuckoo: it's not only ten km from downtown Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a suburb in the summer rain; it's as small as when 27 black families were founded in the 1880s.
(Today 90% of the inhabitants are black.)
They still take care of the outsiders who come here looking for what Eatonville has to say.
Most interviews require prior permission, and a few things, such as the oldest fresco of Eatonville, which is painted by a white man and the blacks working in the lands, should not be photographed.
In Eatonville, many people, among other things, are afraid that self-confident Jones, who is particularly attracted to the bright red, are misunderstanding their separate community.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has grown, the pride of the hometown has increased.
In particular, young people are increasingly looking at Eatonville, as Hurston saw his own species: they are wonderful, with problems and everything, they are neither better nor worse, as proud, as creative, demanding, foolish, and confused than other racial and ethnic groups in America.
His honest civil attachment to Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, is designed to return to the local government after the college is completed, or to work with the police, which he believes will need help.
And it seems that the younger people have learned to describe Eatonville correctly, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twin couple: Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
“Most people who travel here think that this city is nothing compared to the rest,” Alondra Kenon recently said on Sunday after the worship.
“But if someone stops and takes a little time to know his history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
We all speak the language of finance in New York
Nothing has changed on the surface.
If tourists didn’t care about the journalist’s bulls and the huge television exhibiters on Times Square, I wouldn’t notice they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never find out that with glass walls, bee-shaped offices above their heads, bankers and venture fund managers who have held power to New York have been the hardest days since 1929.
The couriers are still rolling their metal tea trucks on the sidewalks, carrying the cups with the muffin to the morning meetings.
There are still men with Spanish lips sitting among the blocks, carrying fifty-one of the ginger shirts that hang through the shoulders, similar to that of the ginger.
The office workers still stand in line for their sweet bakery on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 a.m. on a weekday.
I didn’t feel like there was any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the alarming news, I decided to open a new bank account.
I deliberately planned to do the thing in my local account of JP Morgan Chase bank during the afternoon's rest, but there were 20 people in front of me.
Not in the banker's window where you can pick up or deposit money, but at the customer service counter where older customers order checkbooks, the tourists ask for directions to the Macy's store, and where new customers open a bank account.
Many before me, I later learned from Starr, the “ordered” banker, had the same intention as me.
However, unlike me, they have already removed their money from smaller banks in their residence, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took money from the so-called savings banks (which are like housing cooperatives), loan cooperatives, and small-town savings funds that operate only in a single state and are allegedly treated as family members.
In the past year, 15 such banks were quietly destroyed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion-dollar bank was put under bankruptcy, and when the New Yorkers went home for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, was a bank rescuer with $440 billion savings.
The pre-existing office and shop workers, in fear of another collapse, transferred their money to a bank that seemed to be safe sheltered, to the bank that made most of the capital injections out of Wall Street.
People in New York have become experts in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman at the local Chinese store said on her phone she went bankrupt from Lehman Brothers bank and her huge-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were complaining to a lazy colleague.
Lynn, a man in uniform for my apartment's block, turned into a theme for his 50s, now we're not talking about Brad and Angelina, or about my food delivery, as we used to.
He spoke to me after I went to the bank: “I invested all of my money saved in money market instruments.
I'm not risking it, I'm not risking it.
Muslim tombs were abused while Austria was on the right side of the keyboard
Heinz-Christian Strache, the Austrian Freedom Party on the right, and Filip Dewinter, from the Belgian right-wing party, Vladimir Belang, participated in a demonstration in Antwerp, 17 January 2008, on Thursday, where he presented the organization called “Varians Against Islam”.
There were signs of traffic that followed the tables, which represented mosques crossed the red line.
According to the police, extremist extremists are responsible for the abuse of the Austrian Muslim cemeterys, which took place on the same weekend when the extremist right-wing parties were significantly preoccupied in national parliamentary elections.
There were more than 90 graves of graves in the traun cemetery next to Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators painted Jewish symbols, such as the David Star, on a few tombs, but according to the detectives, they were trying to hide their extreme motives that came from the hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident can be linked to elections in some way.
A spokeswoman of the local Islamic community said: “They were deeply shaken, after the cryout, which happened shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month, Ramadan.
At the same time, Austria will carry out an examination of the conscience after yesterday’s parliamentary elections, during which the language of the political balance will be better.
The two extreme-right parties, which gained almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for the Future of the Freedom Party and the Association of Austria, for a heavily anti-immigrant law, and marked some of their slogans as a critic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the Freedom Party with more than 18% of the votes, expressed his campaign against the heads and bulls, and his dissatisfaction against the alleged food of Islam.
The party, at its final meeting in Vienna, spoke about “European brotherhood,” which would prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are the political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Public opinion polls and analyses conducted directly after the election of the ultimate victory were largely due to the young voting base, who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter was banned from traveling abroad.
Garry Glitter was convicted of rape children, known rockstars were banned by the court from travelling in France and Spain.
The judges then decided to ban Glitter for six months that he had informed the control authorities of his intention to travel to Spain through France.
The Chinese police received a ban on travel Thursday after giving the court evidence of the judgments against Glitter on rape against children.
Glitter, in real name Paul Gadd, was not involved in the trial of the Chinese Ashford Magistrates, but was represented by Corker Binning lawyers.
A court spokesman said: “On Thursday, 25 September, Kent police filed an application to the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain on March 25th.
“Paul Gadd hasn’t appeared in person.”
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities of its intention to travel abroad because it is bound by the law on participants in the register of sexual offenders.
You must inform the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
It is also obliged to notify the police at least seven days before the scheduled departure.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to five years of imprisonment.
The Kent Police said they don’t want to talk about individual cases within Glitter County and about the possible location.
The Kenti police spokesperson said: “The Kent Police will do everything they can to protect children within the country and abroad.
“It’s easier to check someone if they don’t leave the UK because there’s a comprehensive system here that we can manage potential risks more effectively.
“The most important task of the Chinese police is to protect the population of Kent. Through close cooperation, we constantly monitor the behaviour of persons in the register of offenders and in the county to minimise potential risks to the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for rape of a 10- and 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to fly to London.
However, he claimed that he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The rural authorities did not pass the passport test, so he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities were also not allowed to enter the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where the county police and immigration officials insisted to return to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at the Heathrow airport on 22 August and remained there until his lawyer David Corker went to the West London court, Uxbridge, because according to a request from Scotland Yard, he was registered for sexual offences under a court order.
Glitter previously spent four months in prison for the possession of photographs of child rape in the UK in 1999.
According to a source from the Ministry of Interior, Jacqui Smith, Secretary of State of the Interior, welcomed the fact that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
“I’m not taking pictures on stage because I want to show the artist from a personal page – Günther Bauer Photography
There is no decoration, no football, no dance shoes.
Without the excitement of the action, the Grand Masters of Flamenco: to get to know the everyday face of dancers.
The artist on the one hand.
On the other hand, the ordinary person.
And these two pages cannot be separated, except in the distant moments of the inner audience, when we can find a personal movement, we can seize the depth of a captured view, or we can shake the beauty of the unspeakable, yet expressing hand of the artist who is not a stage action.
In the German Günther Bauer Flamenco-people photo series, the theatre of singers, dancers and guitarists is combined with this less known ordinary side of the masters.
Through photos, Flamenco presents its unique iconography from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the growing international importance of Flamenco from day to day – believes that the creator, adding that Flamenco-people could be anyone, since the picture shows the observer that these images are not typically portrayed by artists.
These people on the street are artists who are able to take passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and capture the audience.
Stage photography, however, is not suitable to capture their personality.
Their personality and character are deeply inhabited by their being.
I wanted to create a inner atmosphere that allows me to inherit the personality of the greats of Flamenco through camera.
The Cante de las Minas festival launched its long journey in 1997, making portraits of Flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a record camera.
These portraits, thanks to the camera and theme selection, quote classic photography.
However, the use of different stylistic tools is interrupted by traditional image representation and modernity. The following thought is faithfully reflecting Bauer’s idea of Flamenco: “This is a traditional music with roots, but it changes from day to day to day, and always impressive –
It is not dance, not singing or music alone, it is much more about the artist’s personality and character to enchant the audience.
In the days, the leading motif of the works in El Fotomatata gallery is the search for the essentials, the encounter with the artistic raspberry, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence, and display.
Flamenco's known shapes, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristiana Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are the names of this photo collection of six artists.
The project also became a flamenco-anthology, which will soon be released in an album featuring portraits presented at the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraits for two years has been the portraits of “Verian athletes” with the series “SportARTproject.”
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is slightly different from that, the photographer adds: “I like to photograph people, to know them and to enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre of photography is the portrait.
You meet people, you bring together personalities that you sometimes don’t even know, or who just want to take a few minutes to photograph.
But despite these circumstances, I always try to be a photographer.
The exhibition titled Flamenco-people, selected from the portraits of the contemporary Flamenco, will be held in El Fotomata Gallery, parallel to Alameda de Hercules on October 16th.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he works on is “ready”
The location and the act are still unknown, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also in the process of writing a new novel. The main character of the novel is an Irish nationalist Roger Caspont, who lived in Congo for 20 years and has also visited Amazonia.
The author of the Nobel Prize in Irodalm said yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia that his current work was “prepared for certainty” and “all signs that he should not write the novel.
“If I were smarter, I wouldn’t do it, but I’m going to do it, and I hope I’m going to do it at the end of the day, he closed his presentation with these words at the festival of ideas, thought and opinion exchanges, which took hundreds of writers, historians, and journalists in the city of Aqueduct for four days, as well as thousands of visitors.
\"The city and the dogs,\" he wrote, was one of the most prominent participants in the celebration of literature, and he also replaced the hopes of it.
Vargas Llosa won a novel from Hay Festival voted by the participants, Dickens, our friend, an old edition of the novel.
After the greeting of Félix Romeo, the audience was soon welcomed by the audience. The clock was quickly decomposed, during which the writer of Peru, with a remarkable memory talent and a great dose of humor, explained how he developed his passion for reading from a special adventure and his vocation to live life; how he bridges the lack of inspiration with a disciplined written method, with a demanding documentation, with many repairs and rewriting; how his works are built on the vocation of his writers Faulkner, Victor Hugo, and Alexe Dumas, and what monuments.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it was impossible to measure or show whether books would change our lives, but he added: “I don’t think that literature is a mere experience of entertainment or of tsaviar life, because it has an effect on people and thinking, so asked the writers, not to let them tempt and bear responsibility for their calling.
The weather makes it shorter because of Pozoblanco's goodbye, the horse bulls are missing.
Traditionally, the horse bicaviadat, held as the closing times of the Pozoblanco holidays, was removed from the show yesterday morning, after the future horse torredors found the area of the arena unfit for wax.
As a result, the Committee decided, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, to stay with the bull.
The weather conditions have greatly rebuilt the celebration series, since two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday the rain was left with the second bull.
The upcoming main characters, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, would have fought the bulls of Castilblancó.
So they only held a bullfight on Friday.
The winner Daniel Lucque became, took home three ears as a trophy, raising him to the shoulder after a sophisticated and aesthetic struggle.
On the same afternoon, by the two bulls of Aleksandro Talavante, he received a number of ears as a trophy, but this was due to the public rather than its own performance.
However, El Juli followed, who contributed little to the aging of the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable ride with the second bull, most of the audience managed to get out of the probe.
A two-ton van was trying to escape road control.
Four o'clock in the morning, fifty minutes.
The Basque Regional Police is carrying out traffic control in the administrative area of Armiñón (Alava).
The authorities stop a van in which two travels. Passengers try to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of hash, was not visible at the same time.
The investigators persecuted the passengers, and one of them was arrested by a 28-year-old man, and identified as A. A. J., the Basque government of the Interior Department.
The captured man is accused of drug trafficking and illegal abuse.
The case took place in the administrative area of Armiñón, where the staff of the Áavai Regulatory Authority carried out traffic checks on the N-1 motorway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused obedience, suddenly gave gas and then left the inspection site.
The detectives were taken into a chase, then the vehicle stopped on the stoptrack a few kilometres later, and his passengers fled from the highway to a forest area.
The Bask Regional Police finally captured one of them, and after examining the Iveco Daily brand van, he occupied its shipment, 2178 kilograms of hash.
The back of the vehicle was transported by police to investigate more thoroughly and to measure the drug.
In addition, during the verification, it was proven that the false registration plate of the vehicle did not match the data contained in the vehicle’s paper, and therefore proceedings were also initiated against the arrested person due to the misappropriation of a public document.
The Bask Regional Police is investigating the arrest of the other suspect who, as we have already mentioned, fled the highway and, on the other hand, the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old defendant A. A. J. was transferred to the police to conduct the necessary interrogations, and the court measures began within a few hours.
Heather Locklear was arrested for leading her under the influence of the drug.
Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested by the police in Santa Barbaria (California) this weekend because it was under the influence of the drug.
According to a witness, he was trying to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange maneuvers, said one of the spokespersons of the People magazine’s traffic control in California.
According to the witness, around 16 o’clock at 30 p.m., he pushed the gas to the floor, strangled the engine, tried to leave the parking lot in advance and backwards, and went through the sunglasses several times in the back of the day.
Shortly later, the witness, who probably didn't recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also informed the police because he was concerned about Locklear’s life.
When the police arrived, the actress sat in his car, which partially paralyzed the traffic of the highway.
“It seemed like a smoker, so the patrols took the drug and alcohol test to a specialised center.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was a collaborator and the alcohol consumption was almost immediately excluded. The spokesperson also said that, based on the first impression of the officers, it was believed that Locklear was under the influence of the drug.
Lockleart was arrested and arrested under the influence of an unidentified drug. He was transported to the local prison around 19am, where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of an Arizona sanatorium two months ago, where he was treated with anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the United Left to provide the Andalusian Federation to deal with the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the Secretary General of the IU and the United Left said today that the regional Federation of the Union will decide on the case of the former Youth and Sport Council of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva.
“In these things, I am a far-reaching federalist, and this matter is certainly the authority of the Andalusian organization,” Llamazares pointed out the procedure that the party should apply to its former member of the City Council in Seville.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that, in order to detect any irregularities committed by Silva, the \"transpatibility\" should be borne in mind: \"At IU has always been on the plane in order to ensure that such matters are fully transparent\".
He added that part of the training is the strict code of ethics for the public.
“Majusi Blood – Garci Epikus
Benito Pérez Galdós National Episós inspired José Luis Garci, who calls for the famous anti-French uprising of the Spanishs in the Majusi blood, which, with a budget of nearly 15 million euros, is the largest production of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the human price and social analysis he had always performed by his well-known novelist. Today, at the film show Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, Garci told the audience of actors.
More than two and a half hours of Majusi blood will be introduced on Friday in the cinema, and will then be shown as a mini series by Telemadrid in more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, the great admirer of the literature of Galdos, created this childhood dream with this rotation. This is thanks to Esperanza Aguirrre, because he commissioned her three years ago from Madrid to make a monument for the 200th anniversary of the events in Madrid on May 2. Garci accepted the request on the condition that the basis of the story was given by the National Epizos.
The 15 million budget was fully financed by the Autonomous Province of Madrid, and Garci was given a special opportunity: he could present himself with a proper decoration and costume, “the disturbed Spanish, who were wrongly standing with the wrong leader, because the struggle for independence forced the country into a huge lag with the reign of Ferdinand VII,” he said.
The director, however, expressed his regret that he could not count on the budget of Alatriste or Goya’s fancies that hit more than double the Maajusi blood. It was therefore forced to skip a few scenes from the script, which, as many other times, is recorded together with Horacio Valcárcell.
So the director of the New Beginning applied to the usual method of work, with the actors who started the tests before the film. Casting was not, because Garci considers it as a “flagler” and, as he said, “the directorship is part of the theatre and cinema to find out what is going on in the industry in which we work.”
Several actors of the Majusi blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not first enter the camera.
Garci, who is proud of four Oscar nominations and an Oscar award, believes that this year’s nominations for Spain, representing the Hollywood Academy, namely the Majusi blood, the seven French billiard tables and one of the final blind sunflowers, represent the young generation of the Spanish cinema, “where it should be presented,” he said.
Garci's film doesn't count on charges.
“You think you’re working for the post-age, and then you realize that only happiness matters, and you’re happy to have another movie ready,” Garci says in a 30-year professional career behind her back.
Isabel Bayón remembers the life and art of Tórtola Valencia
A Flamenco dancer in Seville has a memory as a dancer in Seville.
The Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalus (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela) moved to London at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in Eastern dances.
During his moving life, he fought as a pioneer for female equality, whether Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against the wearing of a lawn that prevented women’s freedom of movement.
The dance and aesthetic revolution exploded in the war in Europe, and his life was flooded by Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gabbo, he suggested to my attention to Tortola, whose personality really impressed me.”
The Flamenco dancer said: “It’s not our goal to tell your story of life, but to capture your soul.
The titles of his dances were made up of flamenco styles.
For example, the “pilago dance” of the guajira or the “Crete dance” is the tango.
He danced and said to others, “It’s also my style,” he said.
The light of the performance is raised by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda, after the Open Door, sings again at Isabel’s performance; and Matilde Coral, who, in this case, was especially interested in working with a former student.
“Matilde forms the older Tortola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you said yes to the request, it's very honorable to perform in my play.
In addition, Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga music director and guitarist Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón singers; El Páaro's beater, Rafa El Viola, and Juanfra Juárez, who \"plays the permanent character of the true décor with his constant love of love\"
The piece also introduces the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and is also moving to the distant landscapes at the time, including India, the United States or Italy.
“I wanted to give him a memory because his personality had a great impact on his own age, but today he is no longer known and is even less valued at his work,” Bayón said.
The show begins at 20 o’clock this evening at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of Trienium, the “A Newly Married poet’s diary” is published.
The first illustrated edition of a newly married poet's diary will be presented at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where in May 1916 Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia. The presentation is part of the programme series entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008), organized by the Cultural Committee of the Andalusz Regional Government on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize and the anniversary of the death of the two.
In this way, the closing times of Zenobia and Juan Ramón Trienium are the re-release of this work, the International Congress in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize-winning poet's memorial house and the exhibition \"Juan Ramón Jiménez: The bright summer tree\". The exhibition was opened in May this year, and planned to visit New York for the International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalusz Regional Government has obtained a total of eight hundred copies of a newly married poet’s diary published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso to promote the reputation and work of one of the most diverse adnalists.
Without Paul Newman, America is not so attractive.
“God sometimes produces perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that, too.
The quote comes from actress Sally Field, who worked in a film called \"The Victims of Sensation\" with Newman, and reflects the shock and inability caused by Newman's death in the American cinema and caused all of America.
How difficult it was to get the Oscar.
He retired in 2007,
And he was known to be sick,
Even so, his death has shaken everyone.
“Sometimes it’s impossible to put our feelings into words and I’ve lost a good friend,” Robert Redford said in tears, “it made my life better and this country better.”
No one was afraid of becoming ridiculous or overdoing.
One of the heroes of cinema and home went out in a particularly dark period, which was shadowed by the desperate search for terrorism and market relations, self-esteem and dignity in the United States.
When such difficult times go and many people easily lose their virtues and remain very few people we can look up to, we don’t have to be Luis Cervada to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of men, he embodied the beauty and justice of the philosophies.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and a defender of lost and won cases, from the drug-based anti-drug foundation established in memory of his first-born son, who died in drug overdose, to the creation of a domestic biofood brand.
It was a real gift to a country that was difficult to overcome the culture of self-sacrificing nutrition.
The overwhelming wonder wave went all over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and origins.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, says he is not a man, but a time has passed away with him.
Another English, Oscar award-winning Sam Mendes, said that his joint work with Newton was clearly the highlight of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy from Australia, called Newman the greatest inspiration.
“He has made a great deal of noise for all of us,” George Clooney, who is perhaps one of the few who is today trying to follow Paul Newman’s way of life: they require honesty and private life away from serious and cameras.
This is not always easy if it is possible at all in the midst of today’s media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman is the example.
He once divorced, but then lived in a faithful marriage with Joanne Woodward for fifty years, and he would have had a lot of occasions for disbelief.
“Why do I eat hamburgers elsewhere when the meat is at home?
In heaven, you can be proud that your girls on earth are also fans, which is not very common in America.
“No one was as proud of all his works as a loyal husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather, and a devoted human friend,” he said.
The Great Way of the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us have dreams of a Madrid Olympics, and after the 2012s failed, it may be 2016.
But, I'm asking, are we really ready for it?
Because if we leave yesterday's race, I don't think so.
It was called the perfect race, but I think it was the worst of all that I've ever been.
The blockage of misunderstandings was characterized, and if it were to be appreciated once, and I would be the examiner, the result would clearly be a fall.
But let's go in line and start at the beginning.
The misunderstandings began by taking over the number, because that was why they had to arrive earlier.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go faster, at least get everything at the same time (including chip, to avoid a job later).
That's not what happened.
First, only the number was given (first senseless, only to go there earlier) and (after the usual position), as surprising, only the S-shirt (second senseless, because I got my XL size).
What world do we live in?
Or have they decided to save money and only buy cheaper, smaller shirts?
But anyway, these things are still breaking down compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to take the chip early, it took 15 minutes from the arrival, and even the backpack had to be handed down.
The waiting lasted more than 35 minutes, which is unclear in the case of a race of more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't given up the backpack yet.
In addition, the rain has made it even more pleasant for more than 40 minutes of waiting, which has been examined by folk and stand-up attempts.
I think we'll get about 500 sure pneumonia tomorrow, and some of us, including ourselves, aren't going to get our location with our actual time.
If you asked me about the perfect race, of course, I wouldn't think of it.
So I think we can continue to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft (virtual) receptionist
At MIT’s emerging Technology conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence, which, however, is capable of doing some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, for Microsoft, a vehicle on the company’s territory) based on the information heard from the conversation.
This “reception – a camera and a form and facial recognition system can help you recognize how many people are in the room, who are in the room, and even remember what clothes they wear – and hear and understand the key words of their conversations.
In addition, you can group the present ones on the basis of conversations.
In the tutorial video, the reception lady identifies a third person, but she knows that she is not part of the company that talks with her and not the employee of the company.
He asks if he came to see someone and made sure he'd be in a hurry to help him soon.
All this without the blue screen.
Amazing.
But that is, of course, the music of the future.
Currently, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows Operating System.
Many people said this week that Microsoft has become a strategy.
Windows will be 7 smaller and contain fewer additional programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if the computers only run the necessary programs instead of many commercial garbage, then the machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's something.
It was invented in Spain, given that Microsoft has added additional features and extras to Windows in all new versions.
Change of direction will be restored.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly needed in the background, and the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I also joined the theory that Google did the first step to become a Windows competitor.
Many have correctly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as an essential element of hardware and software dialogue is essential.
You play the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it will have to be accounted for in the “death” of the operating system, not in absolute, but in relative terms.
This week's statement by Ballmer supports this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system and more and more attention to the web browser.
The computer is only turned on to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and more and more times to browse than we spend in the window world.
What is most of the applications with the system?
Less is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less than Vista.
Less difficult, less heavy, less complicated.
Microsoft’s goal is to integrate its services on-line, and to ultimately become an alternative to Google.
All they need is an example of why.
This photo was taken in Redmond at the beginning of the month in a collaborator for Microsoft professionals.
The soda machine calls them a poster, uses the company’s browser. - Your browser. Our future
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft processors used Google for online browsing.
The new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also announced last week.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of 2009 it will come, in fact, rather in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to throw Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 into the combined market.
The mobile phone is increasingly operating as a computer.
But the slip, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely ruin their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore this in the diamond of Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick, and Al Pacino in the Christian Cross of Francis Ford Coppola, and this is also one of the basics of the gay public.
And if we are already on the list of specialities, we can recall the peace figure of the fat lifter of the migratory circus.
But what are we talking about?
Thus, the \"tank\", as the English lips call it, but no competition with the Le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles will come to competition.
First of all, because of his elegant name, although they refer to him as “Marcel” as a friend, what he owes to the sport, according to legend, Marcel Cerdan was named after the singer, Edith Piaf.
Marcel’s excellent cotton material, uniformization, distinctive emblem, and the small (almost recognizable) Belgian flag are also out of his competitors. This is the most distinctive models hidden in the neck of the shirt.
But the Belgian company does not just make tank tops.
Sportsmen, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, wools, sailors, baby clothes, miniseries - and we could still list - all of the company's products.
And they all belong to the comfortable underwear category,
Although it is also unfortunate to wear them as underwear.
They're too good for that.
“I would love to be a young mother; no matter who the father will be.”
It is very similar to your brother, but it has succeeded in achieving itself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.
At present, Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling is much more than giving some pretty and beautiful girls their name to something.
He was present at the promotion of the new headquarters of Mango in Paris, as well as the transfer of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
There is warmth and gentleness.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
Mango's new autumn-winter collection, designed by my brother, Penelope, is also involved in the publication of the second award of Mango Fashion Awards and the galavacsor for Valentino's honor in the Opera.
It's a big day, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at the Mango company, where did you draw inspiration to the new collection?
We both love the films of the 50s and 60s; we took a lot of it.
And then, often I just walk into the city and watch women dress up, how they change and pick up their clothes - this is one of my favorite time spent.
You work as a dancer, actress and fashion designer.
That's what I think, but in the end, these three things are related, because there are a lot of common points in them.
When I was little, I was looking forward to getting to my grandmother and my aunt's lockers.
Well, that was you in the Khana, he almost got up with a amusement park.
And then, as a dancer, I've always tried to watch my dress.
You know, we dancers like to figure out our own style of clocks and tests to make us feel good when we look in the mirror.
And in the role of the actress, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
You see, it's all connected to everything, and I respect the designers and their expertise.
You recently celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no.
I feel better than ever, I love the 30s.
I think women are really worth it, they've already experienced enough, and they're making less mistakes in life.
The biological clock is not worrying.
Since I was a kid, I've been doing what I like, and it's filled me with great inner happiness.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm gonna be a mother, because I was born as a woman, and I really don't want to be a young mother, I don't want to miss it.
As far as the future father is concerned, no matter who it is.
I would like to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's just say a few words about the movie last year, you've been filming more films that haven't even been shown.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started at the theatre, am very impatient and restless, want everything right away, but of course I know it's impossible.
I can’t wait to show you the last hour and the search for the grave of Christ.
I wonder what you're gonna say to them.
If I know, you've been on the run with Naomi Campbell for a couple of days.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go on the run as a model.
Naomi Campbell has long known me, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London, which she has arranged for her own, Women's, for a better world. I have chosen two of my own Mango collections. The clothes presented were auctioned, and the amount of flow was offered to Naomi's NGO.
People don't even know how good Naomi is.
I know so much about it, and I can assure you that half of it is not true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of your activity.
He asked me for a noble cause, but if you wanted me to stand on my head, I'll do it.
If women in the third world lose their bet, I don't know what's impossible.
The returning drunk drivers will be obliged to install \"Alcolock\"
After three drunk driving violations, the Ministry of Home Affairs would require a car to install a structure that would prevent the vehicle from being launched if the driver was drunk or didn’t blow into the structure.
The proposal was presented in June and is currently being dealt with by the Public Prosecutor's Office, according to which the pilot project will last a year.
Since the aim of the project is to restore the market, the driver will also have to take part in a repeated course on driving.
In addition to the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Institute for Auto Safety Technology (FITSA), it is also involved in the experiment.
According to the statistics, 30-75% of the drivers arrested for drunk driving are back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, since the system connected to the vehicle will determine the alcohol level of the air being blown in. If it is higher than permitted, or if the driver has not entered the device at all, the system will not allow the car to be launched.
The cost of more than 1000 euros of instruments would cost the offender.
A study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year of installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could save their lives each year.
The measure focuses on offences for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent crime,
On the other hand, it is easier to introduce, since the implementation of the legal reform is carried out in the ordinary meder, while the necessary criminal reform requires fundamental legislation to be amended.
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which calls for the installation of the system into school buses, on the French model.
Mexico, in closed shoes
At the time announced in the program, he landed at the President's Hangar at Benito Juárez airport, Mexico, at 17 a.m. at 40 p.m., the Spanish Air Force Asturias Duchess Party.
The sun was already down, but it was still so hot that we could only see the royal party leaving the plane using our hands as an eyebrow.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other prestigious personalities were standing.
A few hours before I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Duchess couple would come to the city for official visits.
Well, that's great, but for a while now, there's no airport transfer... the woman's out of here or something like that.
- No, sir, the lady is Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or so...
But the Mexican press, then you know everything about the Duchess of Asturias and the significance of your visit.
Many of you are waiting for the red carpet of the airport hangar, the crown made by the 27 sailors who protect the dignity.
It appears in the duke, smiling, in a sea-blue dress, and then the princess, too, in her long hair, in the wind, in the restrained clothing, but not in the usual toe-toe-toe shoes - they may have been warned that Mexico City was threatened by a storm.
They stop and smile at the cameras for a moment and then enter the room where the official bet comes.
In the gate of their hotel, which is one of the city's four largest hotels, there is a reporter on Mexican television.
The Most Valuable Fashion Award
The world's most suitable place to give a fashion award is undoubtedly Paris, and today's live fashion designers are the most sophisticated and coolest undoubtedly Valentino.
Mango has recently announced El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards’ second offer for the international awareness of the young talent of the fashion profession.
The Grand Prix is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first competition, saw his own designed clothes in Mango Church under Boulevard Haussmann 54 in Paris, and he was slightly relieved of the insurrection.
By the way, this company’s second largest European business and recently opened on 1335 square meters.
The biggest business is in London.
We finally found ourselves in a luxury bar at Garnier Opera in Paris, in the middle of the telecommunication event, as well as in the middle of the jury's presentations.
In the most vibrant Chagalok company, the Presidential table of the Galavacsora Mango showed even more spectacularly.
Nati, who, because of his recent death, came with a heavy heart and sorrow, wore a piece of the company and a few breathtaking jewels of ELAH. With his son Luis, nearly two meters tall, he accompanied Valentin to the main table of dinner for his respect.
Andik, owner and owner of Mango, had fun with the guests. At the university with Rotchil, they were so knightic that they were finally without a suit, because they were both gifted to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in his own-designed pants and shirts, and at dinner he wore a sexy long black dress. At the night’s opera, Gaya Toledo became so fond of the ballet room that he remembered the old times in the gallery with one of the bars and a grand plie.
Inés Sastre did not attend the palace visit, but he showed some photos of his son on his cell phone before.
The next morning, we were able to enjoy Oliver Martinique - he was also two meters tall and motorized - and John Travolta arrived at the Paris Intercontinental hostel. He also brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he said well in advance that he didn't ask for any fragrance in the room.
Stars under the Paris-star ege.
Oh là là, c'est la.
1001, the stress resolution number
There are not 1000, but 1000 and one way to turn off the chaotic and messy everydays.
Another good news is that we can find everything in a single book that comes to the bookstore on September 30 to bring peace with us.
It’s almost embarrassing at 7 p.m., but it’s even worse to think about how accelerated life is forced to live every day in today’s world.
The office's name is tension, and the computer's back pain.
Stress is the population of the 21st century.
But there is no one or two ways to overcome daily fatigue and overcome workplace problems.
No, this number is exactly 1001.
In addition to the classic massage or spa, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in his book so that everyone can find a solution for the most favorable and free minutes.
The stress resolution work bears the title of 1001 relaxation method and the flooding calm comes from the Pearson Alhambra y DK publisher to the bookstores.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will certainly shake you in your faith.
In addition, it also serves with other ideas that all help to relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% natural food.
If your adrenaline is too low to refresh your body and your stress life has become a central problem, it is time to back down in the chair, relax and focus on reading only.
People who speak in dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I am not thinking of those who are upset and completely alert about what happened to them that day, but of those who talk about sleeping.
The phenomenon may seem scary for the first time, but in fact it is completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure more of them have said he was talking at night.
Its frequency can be completely raspberry (for example, only once in a case of a high fever) or more regular (once a day, a week or a month), and the child usually does not remember anything the next day.
The appearance cannot be traced back to a single trigger.
Often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night sweats, night bed (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but this is not legal.
As mentioned above, a high fever-related condition, or even a stress situation, or an accompanying effect of an increased nervous state may occur.
In any case, it has not been studied so far.
The intensity of the speech is also very changing.
It can be quiet, calm, it can be made up of uninterrupted words, mortality, but unlike these, it may also occur in the form of screaming, crying, or a longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and the specialist. The study can reveal whether there is no problem of great anxiety in the background and can offer a solution.
As mentioned above, it is a benign phenomenon, therefore there is no cure for it, unless the sleep disorder is associated with any other, manageable form (e.g. insomnia or stress situation).
However, there are a few things we can do, here is a preventive measure:
Please note that the child stays calm before bed.
Choose relaxing games and avoid watching children’s scary or aggressive TV shows or series.
For children who are prone to nervousness or more difficult to relax, we teach children some methods of relaxation to find inner peace easier.
This will help the child sleep calmer.
If you talk while sleeping, try to keep the rest of your work.
Remember, this is harmless for the child, and they will remember nothing the next day.
Useful advice
Do not wake up the child.
It would be useless, because the child is not conscious, but it would get out of sleep.
Even though he talks, he actually sleeps and rests.
Remember, if multiple strong anxiety is accompanied by the phenomenon, to contact or to reveal a recommended specialist, what triggers the child’s high anxiety.
If you speak clearly (this is the rarest case), don’t start asking questions to know anything about it.
It would be unnecessary, because when you sleep, it is not so conscious to gather your thoughts.
On the other hand, you only hear the speech, but you do not see the dreams associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of the hearers and possible conclusions.
Never tell the child that they can ask about their secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
This has caused a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it's just a few minutes of harmless episode.
Illhaeusern
After a long deep flight, the Illhaeusern team finally took a new boost and gained victory on the domestic track.
Although there was no rough match, the yellow-blacks were in a number of situations, which they could eventually win by using one of them.
The pace of the match was not too tight, since the attackers had difficulty feeling the right rhythm.
The first shot was shot at by Captain Kauffmann, the captain of the guest team, but the remote ball touched the upper corner of the gate. Then Illhaeusern was shot and followed by the shootings: Fonderflick tried a remote shot, and then Hirn shot over the gate. Romain spemé, and Diebold also tried to shake against Dannemarie with a remote attempt.
On the other side, players in a block were protected on the midfield, and only the hereditary Riahi was in a shooting position.
The beginning of the second half was crucial: first Riahi and Temporale were in position on the Dannemarie side. Then he was born the first goal: after Diebold's first shot, he got the ball with the excellent placement of Marais in the evening, and then brought it to the gate (53 minutes).
However, Illhausern’s goalmaker did not enjoy the glory long enough: twelve minutes later, he was forced to leave the field, so his teammates had to continue the struggle in a man-sacrifice.
Dannemarie, however, was unable to take advantage of the advantage: they did not cause much trouble to the domestic team, who were just a little bit back to confirm their defense. Only the last seconds kept some excitement when the ball was very close to the gate.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes an exit to Brittany.
On Monday, the demonstration by fishermen damaged the traffic of several Breton and Normann ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the Port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère to meet the protesters.
The latter promised to accept the president in a “constructive spirit” and express their absolut hope that Sarkozy would come with concrete proposals.
The president's visit is in line with the meeting of the \"revolutionary Committee\" set up by Breton fishermen with a view to taking action against the increase in the price of gas oil, as the price of oil exceeded the average price of EUR 1.14 per litre.
David Martinon, a spokesman for the President of the Republic, said that the President will discuss \"the matter with fishermen what ways to help companies regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers\".
The fishermen are determined to wait for Nicolas Sarkozy to arrive.
On Tuesday morning, Morbihan and Calvados held traffic-restricting demonstrations, with which nearly 10 km of congestion were caused.
They also paralyzed Quiberon's yacht connection, but the roads to Belle-île were not closed.
On the Quiberon peninsula, roadblocks were placed.
On Monday, the sailors have already witnessed their determination. Then in the morning, tires and pallets were set up before the fuel tankers of the Brest ports, while demonstrations were held in Concerteau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other ports of the Atlantic coast and La Manche. In the Vendée County, for example, the fishermen did not board a ship, while around 20 ships in Le Havre prevented the traffic of commercial vessels.
In the evening of La Turballe and Le Croisic, located in Loire-Atlantique County, the huge Total Oil Mining Block in Donges was removed.
On the other hand, the fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting at the Ministry by deciding on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the “Criminal Committee” should decide on its next move and participation on Tuesday at the meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the leaders of the national fisheries committee, as the committee did not support their efforts.
“The strike continues, because “fishers do not allow their claims and are not willing to travel to Paris,” said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on gas oil are currently paying about 50 cents for their liters, but they think that the operation of a ship would only become profitable if the price of gas oil fell below EUR 0.30 per litre.
The wonderful Paul Newman
The “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid” – an unforgettable title player at the home of Connecticut, reached 83 years of death due to cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes were also honoured by the artist Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer does not change its 2008 delivery plans
Despite the global economic crisis, the Brazilian airline plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, is able to keep the plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008 - was confirmed by Fredrico Fleury Curado, chairman of the company.
In the first half of the year, the company carried 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company is highly dependent on the Chinese market, especially for its 30-120 passenger aircraft.
Embraer has delivered a total of 41 machines to Chinese customers over eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which has been set up by US financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion previously paid to it, has announced the release of the Dominican Republic of the Financial Times.
In addition to international life insurance and U.S. pension insurance activities, AIG would be a major part of almost every other business, the newspaper clarified the resources that are close to the case.
According to the Times reports, the Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to examine the possibilities for sales.
AIG did not confirm this information.
The portfolio of assets that AIG wants to sell includes the airline’s international Lease Financial Corp., the shares of the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance company 59%, as well as the real estate portfolio and private equity investments - the Times adds.
However, according to the newspaper, there is no final decision on sales yet.
AIG has to get liquid assets quickly to repay the $85 billion loan approved by the US government, and thus assumes the risk of becoming up to 80% of its capital and losing its shareholders accordingly.
A study by Paris Historique on the Morning Meeting of the Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historical recession on Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson’s bank rescue plan. The Dow Jones index fell by 6.98% (which never saw, was about 800 exact reductions), and Nasdaq, with 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJIA) sank at 777,68 points, so closed at 10 365,45 points.
The biggest fall in the index (684,81 accurate) has been recorded on 17 September 2001 when the trade began after the terrorist attack on September 11.
Nasdaq, based mainly on technology papers, fell to 1,983,73 points, while Standard &amp's 500 expanded index of 8,81% (i.e. 106,85 points) decreased to 1, 106,55 points according to official closure data.
The Wall Street Stock Exchange was already weakened at the opening, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the market balance bank rescue plan, it started to fly deep.
The representatives rejected the funds requested by the Minister of Finance by Henry Paulson, with 228 votes to 205.
The plan was taken by nearly two-thirds of the Republicans.
“From this, the market has filtered down bad signals, as it seems that Congress is unable to approve a plan,” Lindsey Piegza, the FTN Financial Analyst.
“It also seems to me how the market was counting on this plan,” he added, and then expressed his concern about the fact that if a few days later they accepted such a plan, it would be “too late.”
“If the plan is really doomed to death, the Fed (American Central Bank - the Serk) and the other central banks will have the line to deal with the crisis and the lending conditions will continue to tighten – Brian Bethune, the Head of Global Insight economist.
To increase the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: “Every day that has passed, another and more financial institution will be bankrupt in the United States.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy on Friday, the authorities made sure that Wachovia's banking branches were bought by the rival, the Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, which has made urgent measures necessary to save banks in the UK, Benelux states, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market has developed not only an American but also a global crisis – according to the FTN Financial Analyst.
The bond market has been significantly affected.
The 10-year-old government bond reduced from 3.827% to 3.632% on Friday night, and the 30-year-old returned from 4.357% on the previous day to 4.161%.
Obama won the first television match
The first debate of the two US presidential candidates was followed by another one, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would be the winner of the match.
Not surprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign leaders both told themselves about the victory in the television parrot followed by a third of American households.
According to David Gergen’s political analyst, although John McCain’s action was honorable, it did not prove to be quite impressive enough to stop his popularity loss: it is proven by five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic candidate is better in the fight: according to the results of the polls published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage against McCain (44% and 49%).
According to 39% of the respondents, Obama will win, while 25% will win McCain according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to further increase its advantage with his partner Joseph Biden's great performance on Thursday. Biden's first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
Bill Clinton warned me this weekend: “It would be hard to underestimate Palin.
You have a good feeling.
McCain in his 70s never fails to put his own, undisputed foreign policy experience at the forefront. However, he emphasizes his opponent’s “necessary” on these issues, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
“It seems, Senator Obama doesn’t understand that he’s attacked several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary for the presidential position,” McCain said.
This is the main attack surface that has been used by Republican TV ads since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that he represented the future.
He did not allow himself to be disturbed: he was united and precisely formulated.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore a picture of the United States in the world.
“McCain still doesn’t understand, however, Obama has already cut back on the anti-democratic ad broadcasted on the weekend, which puts it in the eyes of the Republican leader that he has still not measured the impact of the crisis on the American “city of the street.”
“In 90 minutes, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in front of 20,000 people who gathered in the rain in North Carolina for the election meeting.
Not even the words of the “middle class” or “workers.” The confused situation in the financial world undoubtedly favors Obama, whom the Americans consider most appropriate to save the economy on the edge of the collapse.
“The next week may prove to be a turning point,” said Charles Schumer, the influential Senator of the Democrats.
Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton government, has such excellent incentives in the field of Obama’s economy, such as Bill Clinton during the financial crisis in 1998.
In the eyes of the Democrats, the current crisis is “the final judgment over the bad economic policy of eight years, created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain.”
The Illinois Senator reaffirmed that despite stock exchange fluctuations, it will be able to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans. He added that the primary objectives of creating the country’s potential energy independence will be through the application of renewable energy sources and the development of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to create 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both candidates carefully excluded the issues that concerned a banking plan of $700 billion (€470 billion): the extremely unpopular plan was adopted by the Congress last night.
Minsk: “My uncle noticed that there was an election.
Young people and oppositions protested on Sunday evening at the capital of Belarus to reject the expected result of parliamentary elections.
On Sunday night, after the closure of the polls, hundreds of Belarus gathered in Minsk's main square to protest against the falsification of election results.
Although the results have not yet been published, many young people protested against President Alexandra Lukasenko with the following words: “Diktator, tell me.”
Some admit that they didn’t even go to vote: “What would I have gone to? They’re doing what they want with my vote,” says a young man.
The protesters do not believe that the regime, which tried to show itself in good colour to foreign observers for the purpose of building relations with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic system change.
If the elections were judged to be clear, the observers would be able to lift the sanctions on the country, under which 40 Belarusian leaders refused the visa and some bank accounts were frozen.
The opposition, however, said that the elections were not clear.
“We were left with the election committees, and our observers could not participate in the vote counting,” said Jurij Potyemkin, a spokesman of the 12 parties, and thus a very heterogeneous United Democratic Powers Coalition.
\"The changes were only nominal,\" Aleksandr Milinkievich stressed, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, and the head of the pro-European movement. \"The main thing is who is counting the votes and in our case this executive power.
If the delegates of the opposition enter the parliament, it means they were appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament allows them to get a seat on television, to meet in the regions of the country and to submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore take the floor in political life, because \"the dialogue with the European Union must be initiated\".
Because if our heavily indebtedness economy against Russia is in crisis and we are unable to renew, we risk being placed under Russia’s control.
We want to be independent.
The opposition is concerned that the European Security and Cooperation Organisation, monitoring the electoral process, accepts the result of the vote as valid.
It is stressed that the participation rate seems too high and that the wide-ranging organisation of the prior vote (which 26% of voters participated in Minsk) allowed any manipulation.
“The president noticed that there was an election – he asked the question of the Social Democratic leader of Aleksandr Kozulin, who was released last year in August from prison, where he was held a political prisoner.
No one was in the polls.
And the Parliament will have up to five opposition representatives, and those who are most in line with leadership.
The silence of the night is falling on October again.
President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Committee will succeed.
Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated his tenth anniversary yesterday. President Francine Décary has been a good reason for celebrating because Hema-Quebec has become one of the world’s safest and most effective blood-loss companies.
Most importantly, he managed to regain people’s trust, which was severely shaken by the impact of the disease in the 1980s and 1990s of infected blood.
As known, the national blood supply treated by the Canadian Red Cross blood supply has been infected with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general revolution, the Canadian government launched an official investigation under the leadership of Judge Horace Krever in February 1994. The aim was to find out what circumstances led to tragedy and to put forward proposals to avoid similar cases in the future.
While the late report of Judge Krever was submitted, some provinces set up their own commissions to plan a new blood management system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gelineau Committee carried out this task.
The Gelineau and Krever reports have created two blood supply services in Canada: one is the Hema-Quebec service provider of Quebec, and the other is the Canadian Blood Supply Society responsible for all other provinces and the two territories.
“When Hema-Quebec began its activities in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in Quebec’s blood supply system,” Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was doubtful.
“In the coming years, however, we managed to regain people’s confidence in improving the safety of blood products and as a result of our work in the field,” Décary proudly states that in early 2008, almost 94% of the people in Quebec already considered Hema-Quebece reliable.
Dr. Décary, however, does not forget that “confidence is extremely fragile.”
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has applied the precautionary principle.
During this period, a number of cases have been discovered in Europe when the mildpox disease, that is, Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, has infected the new Varinian people,\" says the doctor who has been managing the company since its founding in 1998.
“We had no idea if this disease was spreading through the blood.
Therefore, we have relied on one of the most important recommendations of Krever and Gelineau reports. In this case, if we are uncertain and are at risk of developing a serious disease, we must apply exclusion measures. In this case, it was the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes the brain to change, thus inevitably leading to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who have spent more than a month in the UK since 1980.
And a few years ago, all doubt has been found that the disease spreads through the blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that makes the HIV virus much more sensitive to diagnosing. This is the nucleic acid test (NAT), which can directly demonstrate itself in the blood of the blood donors, rather than the antibodies to the virus that were built on by previous tests.
With the help of the NAT test, we could shorten the window recovery, which lasts until the virus can be shown in the blood through our technical tools – the specialist explains.
This period could be reduced to a shorter period than one week.
Thus, there was a significant reduction in the risk of blood clots being infected outside of knowledge and that this could not be demonstrated.
These improvements have greatly reduced the risk of spreading AIDS by blood transfusion.
Today, the risk of getting HIV virus-infected blood is 12 million to one.
“In other words, this means that we should distribute 12 million blood products until someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400-500 thousand blood products every year, it should take more than 24 years for such a case to happen and for someone to be infected with HIV through a blood product.
I think that anyone can take it easy now or write a blood transfusion to restore health – Hema-Quebec's number one leader.
“The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what a new pathogen is in the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood with insect bites.
That is why we have to constantly be careful,\" Dr. Décary continued, and then stressed that besides emergency supplies, Hema-Quebec had to provide enough permanent reserves.
“In the age of the population, demand is also increasing.
Since anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need red blood cells or platelets.
Ageing of the population also affects the stock of blood donors, as the number of people in the network suitable for blood transfusion represents only 3% of the Québec population.
However, every healthy person, at least 18 years old, who fulfils the eligibility criteria, can give blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they have been infected with AIDS or malaria. And those who have been in a country where malaria is destroyed are not eligible for blood for one year.
“With this 3 percent, we have enough resources to meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare that we're out of stock.
However, we need to increase the number of blood donors to the extent that existing ones age because they can no longer give blood after a while.
However, it is very difficult to convince people to give blood, but it is even more difficult to keep them and get them to become regular blood clots.
In today’s rush world, a man hardly has an hour to go to give blood, he regrets Francine Décary.
Hema-Quebec, an annual budget of $297 million, provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin tissue, which are used for almost exclusively severely burned persons.
These tissues are analyzed, converted and frozen, and then placed at the Hema-Quebec, which also manages a single public stem cell bank in Quebec.
The blood can only be obtained from a blood clot treated as medical waste, which allows treatment of severe diseases (such as leukemia) in stem cells.
“We celebrated a few weeks ago that we had been in our bank for the thousand-year-old cord blood sample, and we planned to take more than a thousand new samples each year.
At the beginning of next year, we will probably begin to offer them to organ transplants,\" Dr. Décary explained, who said that the nebula blood extraction program is very popular today.
“Many mothers are sad because they don’t have the opportunity to do so – that’s true, because Hema-Quebec does not have a way to make this complex and costly program available in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - the front page of Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounderst on USL-1 yesterday, and got into the premiere with the combined result 4:3. This was the second and final match for the total results that took place in the Saputo Stadium.
The final goal was scored by Antonio Ribeiro midfielder in 90 minutes.
While it took the first half of the time without a goal, in the second, the two midfieldrs of the Montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, were found in the opponent's net.
By Sounders, Roger Levesque, alone, managed to play Matt Jordan's gate.
Remember that on Friday’s first match, Impact 2:1 suffered a defeat from Starfire Complex in Tukwilla, the suburb of Seattle.
Impact plays in the premiere with Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, which won out of Whitecaps by 3:1 at the first match, won at 4:3, but the Whitecaps won in the premiere with a total result of 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the matches will be clarified today.
Diohej - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadians' favorite triage is waiting for the new season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn have led three great attacks, and finally, the Canadians won the Florida Panthers in a 3:2 ratio of criminal shots last night at the Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal. Plekanec two, and Kovalev closed the match with a goal pass, which was the fourth win of the team's six preparation matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shot.
\"I'm not ready yet,\" the Russian player warned.
“I need another match to really feel like myself.”
“He tried to get too much out of himself in the first third,” said Guy Carboneau.
“But I think the final result of the match was happy.
He received a huge innovation.
Charest's Northern Efforts
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will begin this year.
The Liberal Party’s meeting has barely ended, Jean Charest was on his way to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left) is going to win the interim election today.
“Relieving our last great Northern border: this ambitious long-term goal was put forward by Jean Charest at the meeting of the Liberal Party in Quebec yesterday. The speech was also enriched with visual elements, while the president was trying to concentrate on the essence.
During his presentation, behind his back, he displayed images similar to ‘Moulin à images’.
The three impressive images were followed by each other: the dams of water power plants, mining, Quebec on the \"Google Maps\", maps...
Such spectacular tools are used in election periods.
The Prime Minister, by the way, refused to guarantee that the election would not start this autumn, although he added that his time schedule was very tight.
The plan is the fourth pillar of the \"water\" of the future of Prime Minister Quebec, which is embodied in a \"new economic region\". This includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and a number of conventions with Ontario.
In recent times, the opening to the North (i.e. the northern area starting at 49 degrees) has often been included in the speech of the Prime Minister, but has never held a lecture on this subject.
However, the Head of State has only insisted that he explained why he considers North to be a treasure mine full of enormous opportunities, but he did not speak about the timer, investment amounts, or a specific order of importance for future projects.
Only a few development opportunities have been highlighted: primarily water plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which is further stimulated by the growth of the countries in the blockade and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
It is located in the north – nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds – ranked Charest.
This area, which is “two times the size of France,” is the area of our territory, Quebec.
Not only in us, but in us, he repeated the Prime Minister, stressing that he wanted to create a national founder.
He pointed out that Quebec’s development was largely determined by the relationship with the North: the gold fever in Abitib, the Quebec design work, the James Bay...
\"This is our future, ours,\" he added, having seen a huge map behind his back, holding a stage break.
The North of Quebec, reaching 70%, also includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded for itself, said the Prime Minister at the press conference.
“This is our historic resolution, confirmed by all governments.
There is a border line on which there is no agreement for a long time, and if there is an opportunity, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government,\" he said.
On the other hand, “In the light of climate change, we need to rethink our views on the North again,” said the Prime Minister, speaking about the northern-west passage, which is open every year as a result of the melting of the Arctic ice.
In the opinion of the Prime Minister, in this new geopolitical environment, it is an important task to seize the area.
And what about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would pay particular attention to them, and will benefit many of them from the plan, especially for young people.
Two ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (later sent by Parti Québécois to Hungary) have already started the negotiations with around thirty local communities.
Benoît Pelletier was also led by the Interministerial Committee in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) played an important role.
The Prime Minister does not exclude the possibility of a large meeting, not necessarily a summit, where they create a \"joint vision\".
The development of the North would otherwise be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, integrated and environmentally friendly – the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Charest described this “water” as being in line with the ideas of the pre-existing liberal prime ministers.
“As well as the former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from the challenges.”
This was one of the recurring topics of the weekend that began with the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election to the party of cocktails on Friday.
One of the decisions adopted is that Beauharnois power plant is baptized into the Adélard-Godbout barrier.
“The politicians of our country, including Godboubet, the founder of Hydro-Quebece, the quiet revolution and the national expansion of water power plants, or the Bouurassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to make the future,” said Jean Charest.
In the press conference he quoted another, true, conservative, including John Diefenbaker, the “Roads to the North” program between 1957 and 1963.
In connection with the plan of Eastmain1a-Ruper's power plant, President Charest stressed that the installation was planned for 2012.
“It’s between us, but I plan to be there,” he told his friends, and his statement was accepted by a voiceful tapsvihar.
The Prime Minister, who said in April, that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009 did not exclude the possibility of a vote in the autumn of this year, which the law allows.
However, he stressed that his calendar was already full, as he took tasks at the Chinese meeting of the Federal Council and at the Quebec-New York Summit.
The party meeting held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to make nationalist decisions, which were almost without thought approved. Here, in particular, the “declarations relating to the Constitution” are: the Liberal Party, in particular, requires the recognition of the specific nature of Quebec in the Constitution.
I would also like Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and these members would have veto rights regarding decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition received the main points of the Northern Plan sceptically.
The leader of Parti Québécois, Paulina Marois, re-introduced the North Quebec development policy introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government in 2003 has rejected the use of this policy.
If you hadn't done so, \"we would have been far ahead of us,\" Mrs. Marois said in agreement with Mr. Franzoise Mercure, who was a candidate for the vote in Jean-Talon to be held today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government’s acceptance of the Northern Plan.
“But we want it not to be just a play,” said Sébastien Proulx, a party leader who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from his freedom today.
Letters - A Blessed Country
Vic Toews, the Minister of the Harper Cabinet (also the Minister of Justice), took the courage to call Louise Arbourt Canada a shame last summer.
So to abuse a woman who has fought for truth and deserves all of our wonders, it also reveals a great deal about the people around the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
This is our government, who has not delivered home its own citizens from the western countries concerned from the Guantanamo concentration camp.
This is the government that completely does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the crimes he committed.
This is the only government that, despite Canada signing the Geneva Convention, refused its word and allowed a child soldier to ski under inhuman conditions.
The only government that makes a puppet show about justice, while investigating the guilt of a defendant.
Remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and Canadian lawyers also demand Omar Khadr to be delivered home in Canada in a fair trial.
And our government has a blind eye over the cake: it doesn’t matter to him that a young adult is spiritually destroyed now, and many years of torture is likely to have sealed his fate for a lifetime.
Although we are not yet aware of this, we are currently in the process of destroying our rights, freedoms, and democracy. “Democracy: Harper is endlessly expressing this word, which sounds purely empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no moral anymore: they can abuse, torture, and imprisoned any Canadian citizen according to the comfort of a government leader who has been in minority so far (and what can come after October 14th?)
Many voters believe that salvation can be found in a party that glorifys the Power, the Law, and the Order. They do not see that this government is rocking the values of the good news and dignity of our country with its feet.
Dear Toews, the shame is rather this - not elsewhere.
Opinion - Barrick Gold Orwell
In Le Devoir's September 17th issue, a letter from Patrick J. Garver, the vice president of the Canadian Barrick Gold mine.
Garver said that the world’s largest gold-producing company has launched a $6 million lawsuit against three authors and a small-money publishing company in order to start a “published debate.”
Although judges are independent and impartial, their decision is not based on truth, but on law.
No wonder Garver listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
For Barrick Gold, would it really be the best way of public debate to ruin anyone whose position is contrary to him?
Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada must spend significant amounts on defence and fight in an unequal fight where on the other hand, the army of lawyers who support the mining industry is almost inexhaustible.
In such an unequal struggle, however, it is often used to destroy the defendant and make a friendly agreement that not only silences the opposite, but also scares those who try to address the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views before the public.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold is engaged, this happens differently, in Canada, the disputeing parties generally do not strike each other with a stick, but they say their thoughts.
Therefore, the mine would have been enough to open its books and dossiers and prepare for a real debate in a press, media, publications, paying for independent research groups that could have revealed the issue.
But it seems that Barrick Gold does not trust the public, and with a move, he rejects the requests and letters written to protect the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how to initiate a “public debate” if he disregards the opinion of the public at the same time?
In the head of the Vice-President, this word is likely to mean only commercially paid lawyers, not the total population of Canada: the meaning of the concept is narrowed.
In a democratic state, even others are subject to freedom of speech.
Barrick Gold, however, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are primarily supported by the public because it condemns the brutal procedure of the mine.
The public is willing to listen to Barrick and to make a judgment, but this would be done by a civilised argument rather than by a lawsuit for silence for many. (In view of the term \"the public debate\", Barrick Gold recently called on the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to the surreal thinking of Garver, the Barrick Gold procedure is an open attack against the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of all democratic societies.
In its entirety, the procedure denies the right to quote credible sources, to discuss facts and interpretations, which are the basis for spiritual activities.
If a country like Canada can only study and discuss topics that don’t like the rich companies of today’s world, who will take the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, he could do this according to the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to answer.
In our university circle, we have been able to deal with disputes, differences of views and conflicts for a long time.
Barrick Gold’s unthinkable procedure shows that, unlike his claim, there is no desire to continue an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the institution of public debates in Canada. It is time for governments to finally introduce measures that limit the legal procedures for such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue - Democratics and Republicans
The Presidents of the Bush Government and Congress Republican and Democratic have reached agreement yesterday on economic rescue, which has been the largest standard of such a plan since the great economic crisis in the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis on Wall Street for months has still to be approved by the two Houses of Congress.
Key points of the plan: more effective control of implementation by Members; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of planned public funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses occupied due to the absence of payments; access to the payment of the managers of the companies receiving assistance.
Henry Paulson, U.S. Minister of Finance, Nancy Pelosi, President of the U.S. House of Representatives, and Judd Gregg, a Republican representative who attended the trial yesterday, reported the good news a few minutes before midnight after the two-day marathon negotiations ended.
“We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets,” said Henry Paulson, a representative of the Bush government.
“We’ve done everything to save the real economy and American citizens from the current crisis in Wall Street,” the Democrats explained.
“The main point is that if we don’t do this, there will be huge shock, chaos, and confusion in the daily lives of Americans,” said the Republican representative Judd Gregg.
The negotiations were accelerated in the last few hours, fearing another failure would have a detrimental effect on the atmosphere of investors.
The stock exchange has given itself time to open the morning.
The two candidates later joined the negotiations showed willingness to reach agreement, but they expressed no interest in increasing the situation to the end.
Senator Barack Obama owns an extension of the agreement with elements such as the provisions on the preservation of the property or the payment of the managers of the state-helped companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take some extraordinary steps because of the irresponsibleness of other people, it’s not too pleasant.
However, these steps are necessary – he noted in an American television show.
And when John McCain, a other channel, asked if he would vote for the proposed plan, he said, “I would like to know the details, but I hope so.”
“What I’ve read in big lines is already evident that it’s something we all need to digest, and that we can move on.
The opportunity to do nothing is simply unacceptable,” he said.
According to the $700 billion plan, taxpayers would buy US financial institutions' dubious claims from their money, with some risk-free, unsold assets.
The plan was preceded by a crisis of 14 months, which was triggered by the fall of the real estate loan. This first led to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgage loans) and then to spread to other (commercial) debt securities, and ultimately caused the freezing of liquid funds and the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican representatives failed the first draft agreement last week.
It seems that we have managed to get out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed that certain \"toxic\" tools of companies in a difficult situation should only be secured by the government rather than purchased.
In order to ensure that all members of Congress are satisfied, a provision has also been included in the plan, which requires that if the government has to bear losses for five years within the framework of the programme, it may impose new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion payment would first be paid; this can be followed by another $100 billion if the president considers it necessary.
The remaining $350 billion payment should be approved by the Congress with another vote.
In exchange for help, Washington acquires a share in the supported companies, which will make the profits a dividend and which you can sell after a drop in the crisis.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the cancellation of the real estate covered by the mortgage loans covered by the plan. In addition, it may specify the maximum value of remuneration and final compensation to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The designers of the plan would like the plan to be voted for today by the House of Representatives and on Wednesday by the Senate.
Despite their efforts, however, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
The statements against the plan were repeated yesterday, both among Republicans and Democrats.
“It is very clear that Washington does not hear your voice,” said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House’s Financial Committee.
“Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no one that would favour taxpayers.
Brad Sherman, the “Sceptic Group,” is a member of the Democratic Party of Congress, who has called the “Sceptic Group,” who has shown things differently, but has reached the same conclusion.
“Four hundred excellent economists, including three Nobel Prize Prize-winning scientists, wrote to us to ask Congress: do not rush and look carefully at which path he chooses,” said Sherman.
It was once again understood in Europe that this was a global crisis.
After a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that the US$1.2 billion (16.3 billion) would state a part of the Fortis banking group.
The intervention of the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments became necessary after the French BNP Paris announced that it would not buy a competitor at the edge of bankruptcy after losing EUR 2 million (2.9 billion U.S. dollars) as a result of the crisis of secondary mortgage loans in the United States.
With 85,000 employees, Fortis is one of the twenty largest European banks and one of the ten largest insurance companies.
“This is not a waste of money,” said Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos yesterday.
“In exchange for voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be uncertain.
Meanwhile, on the other side of La Manche, the British government seems to be preparing to state a new bank, which has been run by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over a total of the ongoing loans of Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which real estate loans account for £41 billion (75.5 billion U.S. dollars).
The Spanish Bank of Santander announced yesterday that they would buy subsidiaries and customers of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley, after that Northern Rock, would be the second bank that the British government has wanted to state since the start of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Welcome to the Actor Service
The eyes of the beautiful Azhors, according to some, were the main card, and others said it was the main weakness.
Have you ever been released from a nuanced mirror by American actor with a muddy smile?
Yeah, I don't.
Through his shame, sensitivity, and congenital talent, he was also far away from him from the tight style, which is the breath of the true great monuments of the artist world.
But what a huge path he was running!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer at the age of 83 on Friday on Connecticut, and was one of the last icons of the American cinema.
There was less monumental personality than Brando, whom he was like, and who had long been regarded as a competitor in the cinema. His roles were more restrained and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also proclaimed freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
Often, children come from the mixing of blood.
Newman was born in Ohio in 1925 as a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic shapes of the American dream.
He didn’t think too much about himself, which only increased his merits.
In the early 1950s, he studied at Yale University’s drama and then in the New York Actor’s Studio before he exploded into the theatre, television, and shortly later in the cinema.
In addition to being a fighter of civil rights, in 1979, he reached second place on the 24-hour run of Le Mans. He has been considered a sex symbol, although he has been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we can never know the shadow sides of the life of this mysterious, closed, dedicated actor who hated the climax of show-business. This remains a mystery forever.
He was a man in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked the cinemas: we can only see in his big roles on the black screen of memories.
Looking at the work of life, the seventh American art has gone through us for more than fifty years, with continuous changes in the cinema.
We recall that “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance puppy” are a young man who is adorned by his sage cowboy (1969) and his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), whose role was seen in the “Macska on the hot puppet roof” in 1958.
From recent times in 1990, we can remember in the image of the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is faced with the old age by the fact that his marriage did not change his hopes.
Paul Newman has seen a lot of other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise-Valaki's film, he was the unforgettable artist, Rocky Graziano, who originally played a role in the role of James Dean, and after his death, in 1956, he launched Newman's career as an actor.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant creation of the Great Bahé, which won the Oscar for the best film in 1973.
In his genius film Robert Rossen, \"Svindler\" (1961), he made a desperate, revengeful billionaire and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's film \"The Color of Money\". In 1987, he received a single Oscar award from nine nominations.
Changing times, but always the same face: it was him.
It's always been like this.
The period of his career was marked by the change of eras.
The younger ones are mainly known for George Roy Hill's cult film \"Footbreakers\" (1977), where Reggie Dunlop is a coach of non-normal methods of ice hockey.
The Rajogos, quoted by Coen brothers, saw “The Great Jump” in 1994.
The film Sam Mendes, “The Way of Disaster,” closed in 2003, revealed the role of a Irish mafia chief.
In contrast to many cinematic legends who left the film in a relatively early manner, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with its glazing, brightening and imagery.
Bertrand Tavernier, French film director, did not think that without all the humors, “the subplay’s live chat,” said that his game was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always nice to the handsome Paul Newmann, whose film roles fell into his lap for a long time.
Yet he has often played young and successful characters: rather, he has shaped the characters living on the edge of society – nervous, alcoholic, malicious, or hopeful – who have been able to give back their sods and revolts with perfect credibility.
As a director, Newman showed a less well-known face: a truly eyeful and sensitive person in the heart.
In the 1968 film “Rachel, Rachel” (the adaptation of Margaret Laurence’s novel) with Joanne Woodward, a fine portrait of a melancholic woman.
The 1984 film \"Harry and his son\", with restraint and sadness, reminds his son, Scott, who died in drug overdose.
Last night, Newman remembered the actor. His close friend and old warrior Robert Redford (who, with whom he had played together in “The Great Bahé” and “Butch Cassidy and Sundance”) said, “Your loyalty has made my life better and the world better.
The joy of generosity and existence: this was the secret of the vibrating personality of this great actor whom we have just lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his remarks on civil rights, the environment, the struggle for independent film production and the outcry of Hollywood are getting worse.
We have often seen the picture smile on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods. It has done quite a bad mouth, although it was still funny at the beginning.
However, revenues from such sales have always been referred to as the foundation for children suffering from the disease.
Newman never sat on his beavers: he was always committed to his profession.
In his five letters to his daughter, he wrote: “Your father has always been, and has always been, incredibly grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here.
It is also a privilege for us to follow the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What was produced in Zuschlag & Tsai’s account factory?
Soon, on October 8, the trial of criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politicians and their fellows are accused of fraud and other crimes, including offences, which are particularly causing significant damage in the criminal organisation.
According to the prosecutor, the funds received were used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often verified by unreal invoices.
Government and municipal funds, in general about 65 million forints, were partly transferred to the Youth Left Box, partly in the pocket of some individuals.
The method described by the investigating authority was that the funds received were recorded on the basis of the cost accounts behind which there was no real execution, and the associations never complied with the obligation to commit.
Most of the accounts were fake.
These were acquired in the capital markets, and the circulars were manufactured by Kiskuhalason.
And what would happen to companies in the name of the account production, including on the balaton mountain road to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to his last statement, he had to look like a motel and a restaurant.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, which was then prepared by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the Government of the Capital.
In most of these, István Lados noted with his partner, Andrei, who, according to our information, wrote most of the reports needed to receive the aid.
One of Lados’s studies was a beer house.
According to the two accounts issued by the Zuschlagaks in 2003, the restaurant provided the meals of the ninety-person group of the Commissioner Pont Association.
However, according to the company manager, they would not have been able to fit the restaurant at the same time.
The same is true for the better Future - later together with the Third Year's Prize for the Foundation in the summer of 2002.
A badassonytomaji pension was just three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in one night, yet the account was about a hundred and thirty guests.
But the fantasian printing performers also got overstated when they also mentioned the hospitality of Pigal Ltd, which, according to the information provided to the court, was not included in the documents for the Better Future and Hoppa.
The company’s leader, Győőő Farkas, told hvg.hu that when he was invited to the prosecutor’s office, he immediately knew it was false documents.
“The stamp was in the wrong place with the name of our company and our tax number.”
He added that in addition to the formal reasons, it was not the case that hundreds of people were housed according to the account, because they had a total of eleven rooms with no so many seats.
In addition, the account was also for dinner, while their restaurant was not working long ago.
The aspiring account makers did not follow the fact that the Budapest Travel Office, which they looked at, only organizes foreign travels, so they marked botorul in Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which also did not agree with the company’s accounting practice.
In addition, as revealed in the investigation, VAT was included in the document, although the travel activity to countries outside the European Union was VAT-free.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was a mistake on the four documents issued by Hotel Révillöp Ltd. to the Right Future, because the company’s service was not covered by the said 25, but by 15 percent VAT, and the hotel staff only issued a machine invoice, but the invoice was hand-held.
In addition, the invoice was damaged by the fact that, in the case of a company, road freight was designated as an activity, through the prosecutor’s procedure, which was not carried out by the company based on the investment advice.
In addition, there are also minor differences - an incorrect account format, not a real stamp - because the accounts for the Third Year Foundation, the 21st Century Cultural Association and the Commissioner Point are false.
Like in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunavalto Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not pay attention to the fact that HIB Ltd, Nyírházi, was under liquidation at the time (2001) when he was at lunch for the Young City Association, which is why the company’s liquidation officer, according to our knowledge, denied that he would have issued the paper.
They made it known.
The other group of account issuers is those who were aware that they had to issue a fictional account.
The Esély Budapest Foundation issued an invoice at the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists for the Third Year Foundation for about 4 million HUF.
Collab Ltd.'s leader - according to the accusation - one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic took it on the issue of the fictional account.
It also cooperated with the Zuschlagaks, Biogate Ltd., which in 2003 was the Best Future Foundation, the Atlas Association and the Red Sea Association, with accounts issued for HUF 5 million, with no real economic activity behind it.
There is no money going on because the invoices that have been made have been printed after, but this has already been recorded in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing the invoice is those that can be linked to the defendants.
Thus, the manager of the Ukrainian manager of Delta Trió Kft., located in Budapest, dealing with fuel and motor vehicle trade, was Ivan Kubatov.
The company also issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment in October, November and December 2005 at around HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Ltd., a small student who was in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
This company was the manager of a Romanian man who would have also been transferred by Ivan Kubatov from 2002 to 2005.
We know that in the course of the investigation, Cubatov acknowledged that he issued an invoice on behalf of Kft to Atlas, Hoppa, and the Third Year Foundation, and he took their claim.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian stone builders founded Fa-Bani Jos Faparin Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt..
However, none of the companies really worked, according to the defendant, was the reason they didn’t get a job.
However, he took advantage of the companies because his accused partner, Szente Zsolt, who also made the company's papers, issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation.
Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave the organizations a total of 15 invoices for $142 million.
The prosecutors believed that 10 percent of the amounts on the accounts and VAT hit Cubatov's mark.
The man even used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictional invoices, they were produced for the Commissioner Pont’s tender.
The Y-Generation and the Association submitted proposals for Modern Hungary in January 2006 to the Socialist Party’s public benefit organization, the Dances Mihály Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500-500 thousand forints, but the amounts were not spent for the purposes indicated in the tender.
In order not to find out, the Works Team Ltd. received five fictional accounts for TMA.
These accounts were found in the search of Árpád Kemecsi in his office in the educational wallet.
In the trial, part of the defendants, as did at the prosecutor’s office, is likely to report on the course of accounting production.
The most interesting thing is that if you are the first accused, János Zuschlag decides to overthrow the veil of everything.
His testimony so far has not been too detailed, and although he has promised to speak extensively, he has not done so yet.
The question is whether the socialists had a deal with it in the head of a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, and Zusi takes the fall.
Anyone who may have been offended today, since his requests to alleviate the circumstances of his detention, i.e. to keep his house in custody, were constantly found deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes that cause much greater harm and do not compensate for it can walk freely or at least wait in their own homes for the end of the proceedings against them, there is no possibility for them to do so.
Psychology of overlication: Why do we give more money?
In the auctions, customers tend to pay more money, overvalue the goods.
This known - and seemingly irrational - behaviors of neuroeconomics have been discovered by researchers from the New York University of Neurologist and Economist.
According to a study published in Science, people don’t want to go down in a race like eBay’s auction, so they pay too much.
The research attempted to map the nervous system scheme using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was lottery, the other group was involved in the game, while the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method looked at the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction game - in which an essential element of overlicating the other party - a complex under the stratum, the complex under the brain, when the game was lost, has been intensively operational.
In addition to several other functions, this brain area plays a role in the mechanism of the nervous system \"responsibility\".
Therefore, researchers believe that the price can be explained by avoiding a strong reaction to the striatum.
In order to support their theory, the members of the research group have also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this three groups licensed against a partner in different circumstances.
The control group simply told us how much the real value of the product concerned and they made their bets.
Another group was also promised that if you get out of the game, you will get another $15.
However, the third group just received $15 before the auction, but the group members lost this money in case of a loss of auction.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, just so much that for one of them the winnings were emphasized, and for the other, the loss was emphasized.
However, in demonstrating the hypotheses of neurologists, members of the \"lost\" team were willing to take higher stakes than the control and \"strength\" group.
“These results cannot be derived from any pre-existing economic theory.
So far, only with the joy of victory and the risk-freeness have the phenomena of the auction been explained.
Only the neurological imaging methods helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories by now reaching a third explanation, Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
About half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
The number of domestic hepatitis patients can be done for a hundred years, but only seven thousand are treated, which is why patients often don’t know they were infected.
The name hepatitis is a collection name for various types of infections caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, characteristic of inflammation of the liver and yellowness, but their pathogens and the underlying diseases differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses extend in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the nutrient channel (e.g. infected with food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (severe, vaginal fluid, saliva).
Passengers should be vaccinated against A and B virus, and there is no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis Symptoms occur two to three weeks after the consumption of infected food, generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal complaint, nausea.
After this, yellowness on the skin and the whites of the eyes, the stool is clear, the urine becomes dark, healing can take two to three weeks.
One million people die from more severe types of disease worldwide in liver cancer and liver cancer caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every 10 people infected get medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can also lead to hepatic impairment and liver cancer.
Most infected people don’t even know about their disease because the pathogen destroys the liver’s cells, in many cases the first symptoms will occur only within 20 to 30 years.
Thus, it is very important to carry out early prevention, regular screening tests.
In three groups, this type of disease is much more than the average: people who have undergone blood transfusions before 1991, drug consumers and tattoos.
There are currently 200 million people worldwide infected by chronic hepatitis C virus.
Since the disease can already be shown by a routine laboratory examination, it is important to contact your doctor when any unknown symptom is detected.
In time, the disease can be cured, the virus can be removed from the body, thereby eliminating the infectious capacity and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is the World Day of hepatitis, which was first organized in 2004 by organisations representing patients around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic hepatitis, the development of viruses and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God hurt less?
According to a recent study, the religious faith works as a kind of painkiller, which could have made it easier for Catholic martyrs to die.
Scientists at the University of Oxford carried out an interesting experiment, exploring the way in which God’s faith affects people’s sense of pain, giving news to the British Telegraph.
In a rather bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and the same atheists were involved in electronics, while all of them studied a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of human brain suppression, Catholics have also been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for controlling pain.
The study is the first in a series of research in which academics, alongside scientists, philosophers and theologians, participate in different parts of the university.
The test was carried out in exactly the same way that a sparking device was reinforced for the left hand of the experimental subject, which provided the electroscopic shock.
The researchers asked the experiment participants to look closely at two paintings, the image of the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century with Lady Hermelin.
The researchers of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would create a kind of religious status among the believers, while the da Vinci picture was chosen because it wasn’t too different from the other and thought it was relaxing.
The pilot subjects spent half an hour in a MRI scanner machine, during this time they received 20 electro shocks in four consecutive parts while watching either a religious topic or a general picture.
The Catholics reported that during the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt “safe,” as they were “satisfied and calmed, filled with peace.”
When watching a religious picture, 12 percent less pain was reported than when Leonardo was seen in front of them.
Miguel Fairias, a psychologist who himself participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any strong image, even with atheists, only the right photo should be found.
“We need to find a picture of someone who feels very positive to them, like a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should and in many cases will change our personality,” Wright added.
After the excellent results, only the question is, if Leonardo or a similar caliber painter show the image of a Madonna to the believers, what would that have to do with their pain control?
Is the sight of the quality Virgin Mary even better?
You are what you share about yourself
On your tenth birthday, you can tell Google: you can find at least as much in the pocket of people as you can in the sky; you know where you are vacationing, what your special orders are and what you are interested in.
This is still not enough for Eric Schmidt, according to one of the main people in the company.
As far as the Orwell nightmares are concerned, they do not see the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect more personal data about its users, and this is necessary to keep themselves in the original goal of Google founders, which said: “We’re collecting all the information of the world into the system.”
According to the Google CEO, the company will continue to handle all the information even at the beginning after ten years of world-leading work.
To ask what will happen in five years, Schmidt said that he would like Google to answer questions such as “What to do tomorrow” or “what kind of work would really fit me – but until then, the software cannot answer such simple questions because they don’t know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware of the exact location of the search results, which IP address they were looking for and which page the interested parties went to after the search.
Using the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own surfing background history, look back on what they were looking for, and thus generate more personalized hits for them in the long run - on the same logic, they will offer us products and services based on our previously said and fixed preferences.
What if you use my data against me when you look at what I’m dealing with? – users who are worried about seeing Google’s data monopoly.
In most cases, the degree of potential power represented by the company may be scary, not guilt, fear of punishment, a desire for freedom, or a revolt against power in the internet.
However, the confirmed fact that all of the requested terms are not only recorded, but can be transferred to third parties where appropriate, in such cases, there is nothing to protect the personal rights of internet users.
The most pronounced example of these recent times may have been the concerted action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided information on the social page Orkut, which he maintained to the Brazilian government, about pedophiles.
However, in May, Internet users concerned with personal rights were able to rely on the fact that the company has successfully proven its trueness in the courts against the FBI: Google is not subsequently forced to provide any information requested by the FBI.
(At that time, the federal government successfully fought about fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of searchers that were awarded a reference to strengthening the previously adopted Child Protection Act, but it did not succeed in obtaining the full list of individual users and the full list of websites and keywords covering two months.)
Thus, it is quite contradictory to Google’s judgment: those who keep their personal data from giving because they feel their intimate spheres and their privacy are being used to use Google’s services and engage in a revolt against the multinationals in the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the U.S. gene culture and its enthusiastic computer fans, activists, user-companies' next generation, the \"float corporation\" they see in them, unlike rivals, with Microsoft as world conquerors because of Windows, no matter how much they fight for the same purpose.
This may happen because Google does not request a user identification code in a way other than Microsoft, does not request money for its applications, the open, free, continuously updated source code and software package will be much more accessible, younger, and cooler in its official software-based practice.
However, it may also be because the genes accurately understand the very problematic relationship between personality rights and the internet, which is one of the most frequently expressed keywords in recent years, the web 2.0 took its place.
The web 2.0 is nothing more than collaborating, the fact that we deliberately leave traces behind and use the communication channels at our disposal and the extent of these changes by individuals is the same: we show ourselves.
An average young person can also lead profile from Facebook to Xang, which can be linked to other services such as Twitter, or last.fm that lists his music habits, and can be linked to follow-up systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and can also lead to a blog that automatically displays the latest photo galleries that are stored on Flickr or Picas.
While you can read a number of examples that reveal that a friend can easily discover the morning photo of a common friendly circle, seeing a fake friend who spent the night or fired a company employee just because he describes his sincere opinion of senior management in his blog: a certain concept of private life has been fully reviewed for now.
Anyone who lives online consists of what he shows himself, thus creating a foundation behind the behavior of today’s young people.
But anyone who wants to hide something or at least avoid Google monopoly can do it (for example, with Scroogle that uses Google’s search system, but does not deliberately leave a trace).
For example, the number of people who do not register on social sites with a intent to not detect them can be replaced by alternative versions of Google’s online apps from the text editor to the image manager and messengers, which do not connect to huge server parks and which do not bring together the best profile we have ever experienced.
Public opinion is not so secret when Google shows the protein of your teeth.
The company’s current $156 billion worth more than IBM (€140 billion), Intel (€124 billion) or Coca-Cola (€110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the services introduced at an accelerated pace cause serious headache not only to Microsoft, but also to many other software developers.
The critics, however, find these counterspots to the alarmer: for example, the senior management completely rejected the protests of employees, after raising the company’s kindergarten fee to double the company, found it too costly for the company’s management to eat a daily meal of employees, but all of which, in addition to the fact that Google, even in 2006, had driven a head in front of the Chinese government, and according to their agreement, the company was able to pick up all the hits that violate good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal rules of the company sounds like they do not advertise a new service in advance, only when it is already available, but it is certain that the problems that can be seen in the coming months and years can move the world at a new point: while some believe that Google’s book and magazine screening and archivation project is of such size that the company will soon have to face the Supreme Court of the United States, others are afraid of the Health system, in which we can build a full health profile of our previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database is also a good source for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, Scroogled point orwell, describes the future in which a person can be alertly approached from Google data.
Two young people helped the ancient double killer in the printing ceremony.
Two young people were interviewed by the police in the case of the two murders in Ozdi, and the suspicion that they were assisting in the disappearance of the crime, said the spokesman for the police chief of Borsod County on Tuesday.
The young people acknowledged the act on their burden and are currently accused of crime.
The two young people, according to the information provided by the MTI, are protected in the free house.
Crime can also be punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect of the two-year-old murder in Ozdi, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in a pre-trial arrest on Sunday.
Pre-planned, profit-making, crimes committed by more people are suspected.
During the investigation, it turned out that 23-year-olds had a larger amount of money for a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to compensate for his debt, so on Wednesday, his lender was lured into a ancient facility where he was killed, and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, and it is also a sign that he committed the murder with a gun hidden on the ground.
The police will examine the circumstances of the weapon and its use by involving an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the stock exchange in Prague
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - are recommended by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of the 100 percent stock package of the stock exchange in Prague.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer, despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously excluded from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
This is because the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in state hands.
99% of the shares are held by the Polish State, which wants to sell more than 60 percent of the paper during the course of a few months.
The E15 Czech economic newspaper new knows that the offer of the Poles is the highest amount offered so far by the interested parties for the stock exchange in Prague.
According to the Czech newspaper, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, the chief of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and did not rule out that this would lead to the abolition of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the stock exchange is estimated by market experts at 5-10 billion kroons.
On the basis of the shareholders’ agreement, about 90% of the paper could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European pages
In their comments to the growing international financial crisis on Tuesday, the European pages have already been referred to as “second September 11”.
The Global Financial Disaster is due to the President of the United States - the President of Rome La Repubblica - has not yet been able to set up his own party behind the proposed law, which is set up in his wound, aimed at remedying the desperate situation.
Instead of Pearl Harbor, mentioned by Warren Buffett’s billionaire investor, it is more appropriate to talk about September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press sees the crime in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has brought the world economy to the edge of collapse.
The threat of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing, and the world will suffer.
The Bush plan was not perfect, however, as a result of the congressional vote, the risk that Washington would not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air – just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
The threat can no longer be ignored - point to the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still provide relief to supporting financial institutions and can save them from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
However, if even more banks collapse like domino cubes, then neither the funds nor any more interruptions will be sufficient.
In the long run, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to go beyond their national selfishness and to centralise the control over fragmented money markets.
Only on Monday, more than 100 billion euros were received by vulnerable financial institutions, reminding the Vienna Der Standard that the concerns that, like Americans, European taxpayers should be deeply in their pocket to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is sweeping through the old continent as a tsunami.
They don’t have to lose hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good if they were to record: in which case it is reasonable to put an end to the money of taxpayers to prevent greater damage.
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the Dogon
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid collisions if we were not to imitate obstacles in the natural world?
For example, bees.
In the surprising project at CETEC in Japan, the domgo bees gave the strategic starting thought to Nissan engineers to build the next generation of conflict-prevention systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built the BR23C biodegraded autobot control system, a robotized mini-automatic car equipped with the properties of bees, with the ultimate aim of helping develop a system that eliminates all collisions.
During the flight, every bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our security guard envelope, he explained at the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, the technical PR and R&D brand manager.
It is important to have a role in the complex eyes of the uterus, which can be seen in more than 300 degrees of sight in every direction.
In order to copy the function of a complex eye, engineers reached the idea of a laser telescope.
Before BR23C, it identifies the obstacles within a 2 meters distance in 180-degree visual field, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which immediately becomes an action to avoid collision.
During the fraction of the second, the perception of the obstacle occurs, followed by the movement of the uterus by the autobot, immediately alters the direction of the wheels by turning the amount necessary to avoid the collision.
Unlike any current system, this avoidable maneuver is performed in a completely instinctive way.
“If this were not the case, the car robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the car robot project.
It must respond in an effective manner and immediately, as this technology is the most vulnerable and internal layer of the safety shields, a layer within which the collision is considered inevitable at present.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process should be under an eyelash.
However, in a way other than bees, the difference cannot be directed upwards, downwards or downwards, but can only be two-dimensional and only towards the flexibility of wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibility available to bees to get rid of other bees, only the rotating movement and acceleration and the slowing were used as an option available to the car robot.
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are easier and more energy density, which means they have a longer life span than the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, the instinctive intelligent reaction is an important, not the ability to process data, to store even less.
This structure has to process and react to only a few incoming signs per second.
It is not necessary to maintain them and respond with intuitive logic based on the data of previous maneuvers, so it constantly uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There is no need for gigabájäjja, or you just give me a big memory.
This is the first step towards the development of the technology for immediate bypassing, which, based on Nissan's estimate, can be involved in serial-production cars within ten years.
A further application may be the possibility to combine the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to drive the car to the end goal by avoiding obstacles on the road.
He also became the name of the poison child.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue package law applicable to the purchase of bad loans by banks has been completed.
The first half of the amount is spent.
According to the Eastern Party time, during the new negotiations until midnight on Saturday, Congress leaders reached a point in a debate about a total of $700 billion rescue packages, which has been held for days,\" Reuters said.
We have made a serious progress, said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said that there is only one deal left on paper.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Speaking of the outcome of the compromise, Henry Paulson said that the program would work and be effective, but there will be more to do. Pelosi said this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy into a sequence.
The written version of the package was made public before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday night 8 (i.e. the Middle European Time, Monday at two o’clock), but did not cause a spectacular run on the borough.
The House of Representatives will vote on the draft law on the programme, which will be called the 2008 Economic Emergency Stability Act, on Monday, and then on the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House welcomed the news of the deal.
We are satisfied with the progress made last night and greatly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy,\" said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
The program is different from the Bush administration's original proposal, which would have said that $700 billion would have been spent on buying high-quality, credit-driven securities at the same time.
Now, in the first round, a maximum of half of the amount of 700 billion can be spent using 250 billion immediately after Congress is expected to vote on Monday, on which the Ministry of Finance buys securities with a bad credit background, and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president’s decision.
The program will be controlled by a separate body, which will be attended by the President of the Federal Reserve.
Over 700 billion others depend on Congress’s new decision.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance may apply a combined tactic: at the same time, you can buy bad loans, mortgage and mortgage securities, as well as other types of “toxic” loans.
The purchase can take place in the framework of auctions and directly – the competent authorities of the Ministry have been announced.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program where the financial wallet guarantees the equipment for concern for which the companies will pay an appropriate compensation for the expected damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law would give you the necessary tools to get up to $700 billion for urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it is a wide-ranging purchase of bad assets or to avoid systemic risk of collapse of a large financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as it is signed, he added.
On the other hand, banks in trouble and in state aid are expected to limit their withdrawal money, which the overseas Sleng simply calls a gold parachute.
Payments are limited only in certain cases, and the limits depend on the way the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
In essence, the restriction means that if the Ministry is purchased in the framework of an auction, an additional charge will be imposed on the gold sky, unless it is sent to retirement for the spread bank manager.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will act aggressively to ensure that management money is not exaggerated.
The image includes that existing gold skyscrapers contracts do not change, the restriction only applies to new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history that a legal restriction will apply to the remuneration of CEOs – said President of the House's Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, the Democratic Party.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the state has the right to acquire shares, so the risk of taxpayers is reduced, since they can eventually win the transaction, as the economy and the saved bank stand on their feet together.
The draft law states that in the next five years, the President shall submit a proposal to the Congress which provides for the recovery of expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens asked us to do, i.e. it does not protect taxpayers' dollars,\" said the Republican representative Darrell Issa of California.
Ohio’s Democratic colleague Mary Kapatur believed that the measures were the same as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The domestic sales prices of the industry increased by only a minimum of 0.1% compared to the previous month.
The domestic sales prices of the processing sectors also increased slightly by 0.1% compared to July.
The largest increase in prices in August 2008 was seen in the leather product, in the production sector of footwear (2.8%), mainly as a result of an increase in the price of bags, fibres, and footwear production of 4.6% or 2.5% a month.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials has resulted in significant monthly growth in the prices of the chemical, the production of the product at the prices of the sector (1.6%).
There was a drop in prices in oil processing (1.4%), the production of electrical machinery, equipment (0.9 percent), and, to a minimum, wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other processing sectors, we measured a price increase of 0.2% to 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors representing a significant weight in domestic sales in the industry, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly as a result of the prolonged effect of public gas sales from 1 July.
Compared to twelve months, in terms of domestic sales of the processing industry, prices in the oil processing sector increased to the highest extent (32.4%).
The production of metal processing products in the sector was 13.2 per cent, with a 11 per cent increase in the price of food, drink, tobacco production.
Price reduction occurred in the textile, textile production (2.5 percent) and electrical machinery (0.3 percent) sectors.

In the sectors that produce consumer goods, we measured an increase of 6,8 per cent, and a decrease of 1.4 per cent in investment goods.
In August, the export sales prices of the industry in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent compared to the previous month, with a decrease of 3.9 per cent in the comparison of 12 months.
In one month, our domestic currency decreased by 1.7% compared to the euro, by 7.1 percent compared to the dollar, compared to August 2007, by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, by 15.9 percent compared to the dollar.
Is there no need for a visa to the United States next year?
Göncz Kinga sees a good chance that the US-Hungarian Visa Waiver Agreement will take place around 12 January - the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about this in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarians.
In his opinion, everything depends on whether the electronic entry and control system will be built overseas in time.
At the same time, he called attention to the fact that the new system will not have a travel permit, but tourists will have to register before they leave.
The Hungarian Head of Diplomacy is currently negotiating in Washington.
He meets with the Foreign Minister of Condoleezza Rice, who is awarded the Central Cross of the Republic of Hungary to honor the Star and to negotiate with the foreign policy advisors of the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and John McCain Republican.
The bank rescue package is next to Barack Obama and McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both the Presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, assured the government of a $700 billion package of bank rescue, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
After the negotiations of the Congress and the representatives of the Administration for the days of the marathon, they announced on Sunday morning: they agreed on the bank rescue package.
The financial package aimed at the crisis of Wall Street and the reading of the frozen credit market has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain also show themselves that it is more suitable for their competitors to remove the country from the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, Obama again gained some advantage by taking economic issues into consideration, the advantage of McCain, which he gained after the Republican Convention, by the appointment of Vice-President Sarah Palin.
At a Detroit campaign meeting, Obama expressed hope that the 700 billion package law would be passed quickly by the Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained the consumer protection clauses he also supported.
“Now we have to act with responsibility (...) for your job, savings, the whole industry, the stability of the whole economy,” he said.
He didn't miss the fact that McCain called his economic ideas a long time ago.
McCain said in an interview with ABC, “We will all be hard to swallow it (...) but nothing can be done simply.”
The Republican Senator said that the proposal included the setting up of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the limitation of the execution of top executives, he insisted on them.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role in the negotiations, but he had a daily relationship with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives would hopefully vote on the bill on Monday.
Flats of the German Language Area
The right-wing camp has become more self-conscious within the camp – so Der Spiegel analyses the weak role of CSU in Bavaria.
The sharks are ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online release of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter, the Bavarian revolution, in his article, explains the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to a known polytologist, CSU's erosion has started long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over his office.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades, and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of the era is also the problem of the entire Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising for CSU, but a process that was likely to have ended on Sunday for almost ten years: an undisputed hegemony of a state party has ceased.
For ten years, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7%, the first time in the 1950s at a 50% level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so much so mentioned in the Stoiber era.
This is due to the consistently implemented modernisation of the CSU in the province, which eats up its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the pace they have made a big mistake. However, there could not have been consequences for the loyalty of voters to CSU's loyalty to secularization, educational outcomes, the integration of East and North Germans into the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernization is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this are visible.
The right-wing camp has become more self-conscious, more critical, more self-conscious within the camp.
It is also noticeable that in the last few weeks, the classic civilian groups were the most removed from the CSU; the liberals, the industrialists, graduates and graduates.
CSU's support is now under 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The article on the Conservative Vienna daily newspaper “Ki, with whom? The parties in the resemblance of coalition issues” deals with the confusing internal policy situation that has arisen after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ intervention in its internal affairs.
BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens are not willing to discuss the coalition yet.
The election has taken place, now it is all about the coalition; in the debate on public service television, the party leaders have barely allowed an insight into their cards.
Vice-President Werner Fayemann confirmed that he would like to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that it is possible to cooperate between the two parties - in some provinces and in the social partnership.
The question is whether you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Moltererre - the current President of ÖVP, as well as with a beginner cell - Faymann left it open.
As stated, the Schüssel-Molter course has been adopted.
Repeating this direction is not going to happen.
Molterer responded carefully to the red offers.
As he said, there will certainly be no effective cooperation if Faymann attempts to intervene in the internal affairs of ÖVP.
To choose the opposition or enter the coalition, it is now fully open in the party, the questions must be discussed within the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider BZÖ has repeatedly shown himself open in every direction.
“How to prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility,” Haider said.
Járóka: We need to break the vicious circle of poverty and segmentation
Today, in Paris, the European Equal Opportunities Summit was launched, which this year is the host of France's Presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, the Fidesz representative of the European People's Party, raised the attention of the educational segment in his message to one of the main speakers of professional consultation, because this is one of the most serious violations of Roma children and, moreover, the most serious obstacle to their validity.
The high-level conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - Mr Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Mr Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equality.
The meeting was attended by the representatives of governments, European social partners and the most significant European legal and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz EP Group, Járóka warned that, in addition to discrimination at work, Roma are mainly in need of the labour market through low education.
“The vast majority of Roma young people do not have a middle degree degree and, as a result of poor quality, they can only gain a substantial part of higher education.”
He also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of EU Member States.
According to the MP, these connections are needed in the widest sense, among the Roma and not the Roma.
As early as the Roma student starts school, the chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market will increase through taxes paid on income and consumption.
“The Roma must have the right to quality education in the right of EU citizenship and ensure the elimination of their low-quality and isolated education,” said Járóka Lívia.
According to the MP, the European Union's objective and action-oriented mix is necessary to speed up school desegregation processes immediately, and proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination policies is essential.
“It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, unemployment, and to give Roma children the opportunities of democratic space to contribute to the future of Europe as a full citizen.”
The aim of the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which will be held annually since the last Berlin meeting, is to provide a unique forum for promoting equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: Grace for a Temporary Time
At the end of October, they decide on the fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo
Despite the bad election failure, the heads have not yet fallen, the CSU summits in Bavaria have already rejected the discussion of personal questions.
Mr. Erwin Huber and the Prime Minister of the Province of Günther Beckstein remain still in place, the question of how long the grace lasts.
On the last weekend of October, an extraordinary party-greasing class will decide on the fate of a 17 percent disaster-loss student.
In any case, the members of the many critics felt that they did not stick to their chairs with all their strengths.
This is how the group and the angered members of the base were trying to calm down, who, one day after the \"bajor tsunami\", demanded personal consensus due to the loss of absolute majority.
Five years ago - true, even with the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career - the Christian Social Union earned 60.7 percent, but now, one year after the Battle against Stoiber, he only ran 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU has been a “one-stopper” in Bavaria, which accounts for 18% of German GDP.
However, conservatives continue to expect high levels in the southern province of the Hungarian economy, and will be forced to coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of the settlement within the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister of Agriculture will also be able to take place in the narrow intelligence team that will start negotiations with liberal FDP and Free voters along the right-wing values with a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange finator of fate is that on the list of Free voters, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used by Huber-Beckstein as a paired cohesive puzzle, and then treated the large-scale municipal politician in an unsatisfied way.
CSU leaders now turn all their energy into a way to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition it will play an active role in the fact that Stoiber, the former prime minister of the province and former CSU president, called it the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made a few bit of comments about the CDU, he said they would have earned a lot more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel cannot be a Chancellor if the CSU, which plays a significant role in the success of the country in 2005, is somehow under common force.
According to Merkel, the loss of CSU soil will not negatively affect the capital coalition in Berlin.
Which, of course, is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to handle, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
The SPD has achieved the weakest result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukasenko: 110-0
No opposition member entered the House of Belarus following the Sunday elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is due to the welfare and stability guaranteed in the country led by Aleksandr Lukasenko, but according to the European Security and Cooperation Organisation (EBESZ), this can be explained by the illegalities committed during the voting.
EBESZ, who sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the ten-tenth rule of the 10 million-person country has been without the opposition for a decade, before yesterday’s elections, the opposition, the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ), seriously hoped that, as a result of the amendment of the constitution, the president’s mandate in the 2006 conflicted elections would be renewed by Lukashenko, would allow a number of opposition representatives to appear in Parliament on a fourth occasion.
The ODS also stopped from the pre-considered boycott.
In the background of opposition expectations, Belarus, which is increasingly dependent on Russia, has borrowed Russian gas imports from Russia and has also contributed to bringing Beltranszgaz into the hands of Russia, has sought to improve its relationship with the EU, where, due to the Belarusn political settlement that has been designated as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive entry permits.
He pointed out in advance that, when evaluating the election campaign, the OSCE focused on positive movements rather than on the shortcomings, for example, to ban the start of the third term of opposition candidates.
However, EBESZ's Monday report has already objected to the campaign - in which opposition candidates were essentially unable to appear in the press - and in particular that the opposition could not have been present in the billing of votes.
Along with this, the opposition said that there was still a tangible improvement in the political system: political prisoners were released, and Minsk was willing to take a smaller confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny recognition of South Asia and Abkhazia, which broke out from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus has made a federal state, has been independent for a month.
“We have made two steps forward, one behind, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started,” said Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this remain, despite the fear that “the power was scared to let even one of its oppositions into the weightless parliament.”
The opposition does not plan protesting actions in view of the results, rather trying to send a message about the need for economic reforms to the voters.
- Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we need to print opposition papers in Russia, put obstacles to the distribution of the local authorities, but I can see that more and more people are supporting change, including the elderly,\" Milinkevich said, referring to Lukashenko’s regime, which considers the creation of social security to be the most important result, even the layer of the most officially supported pensioners do not consider appropriate.
- Due to the country's debt, the increase in trade deficits, time is a matter of \"decrease\" of social security - Milinkevich believed.
In contrast to the opposition politician, the Russian observers declared the elections democratic.
Sergey Lebeyev, head of the mission of the Independent Society of the United States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novostyi: “Not the words but the people believe in the actions, so the lack of opposition is a proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: \"Reggeli only before work\"
In the history of the Chigi Palace, single doors were installed for the entry and entry of workers.
From today, this new measure will take place against professionals, to filter out those who block, and then go out to drink a coffee in working hours.
Today, the anti-clockwise novel was presented by Renato Brunetta, the Minister of Administration and Mauro Masi, the Prime Minister's Secretary-General.
“The spring gates – said Brunetta – serve better and more efficient work, reduce deficits and increase services.”
“There will be a new, more responsible and transparent period.
This is the real reform – said Brunetta.
With the Chigi Palace, the equipment of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers will be completed.
Masi says that “the installation of a roller cap is also important from a symbolic point of view.”
We did not experience resistance from the employees – the secretary-general confirmed: “The workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated.”
So the breakfast is over in working hours, no more coffee and bristles.
Brunetta counsels: “A good little capuccino in the morning at seven o’clock, capable of miracles.”
the Roman Public Administration College
At the meeting, the Minister said: “In three months, the shortages of public sector workers were reduced by 50 percent, which means more jobs than 60 thousand people in one year.
He added, however, that the Italian administration should be made more effective.
According to the Minister, the wage dynamics of which, in the last 8-10 years, were twice as large as the private sector and were far above the inflation rate.
At the same time, thousands of civil servants gathered together, joining a statement supported by the Italian Environmental and Consumer Association to object to the provisions of the Brunei Regulation.
“As the minister boasts of data supporting the reduction of disease defects, the war of the “untiring Poles” continues to increase,” the Consumer Protection Association said.
Italy has gathered thousands of honest and hard-working administrative personnel across Italy to report war on the illegal requirements of the regulation.
In the regional administrative court, additional care funds for diseases which can be recovered for service reasons are attacked, the extension of the period of stay of workers on sick leave, which means the period within which the patient may appear and several other aspects of the new provisions required by the minister.
Workplace accidents: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything.
In Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work every day, of which 3 are fatal and 27 are fatal.
According to the data of the occupational accident insurance company, nearly 1.200 deaths occurred in the workplace in 2007.
The numbers show the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death, and require nearly twice as many victims as the killing.
Today, Anmil arranges for 58 times in every county of Italy, the day of accidents at work traditionally held on the second Sunday of October, to draw attention to this dramatic problem of institutions, social organizations and mass communication.
“The worrying data presented by Anmim and the tragic events of recent days also support the fact that there is a prominent role in preventing accidents at work – Giorgio Napolitano, President Pietro Mercandelli, President of the National Association of the Balesit Rokkantak, said.
The Head of State has given a sincere appreciation of the “retentive commitment of the association to preventing work, protecting the interests of the workers affected by the accident, helping the family members of the victims, and making public opinion a catch.”
\"Of course, and everyone's sincerely divided up there will be an atrocities of this kind, which will also be the tragedy of media and public opinion, but in reality we must face the dramatic, repeated and repeated events of the day.\"
Napolitano admits: “We are facing a lack of resources without doubt, funding education and information is crucial.
Initiatives within the school aimed at direct education for young people who are at the threshold of entry into the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to the social importance of the issue, as well as more effective legislation that needs to be put in place.
Gianfranco Fini, president of the House of Lower House, stressed that “the serious accidents at work that end up dead have a social significance for all of us, and the institutions are required to put an end to this as soon as possible.”
\"The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this kind is still amazingly high,\" said Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
However, we do not want this decreasing trend to be coupleded with decreasing attention, because the greatest tragedy is happening when the attention is overthrown.
“We believe that at general level we are still not doing everything we can to overcome the phenomenon, which can be resolved through a complex action programme.
In our opinion, more stringent supervision and control would be needed – Merandelli stressed the need for more ambitious intervention in the field of labour education from school education.
“We also need more efforts to inform the public and to put the teeth on,” he added.
What is most needed, however, is a more responsible employer environment against a phenomenon that presents a social problem.
Mercandelli then criticized the gradual deterioration of the protection net for victims of accidents at work, as well as the ‘aid direction towards which the system has spread over the last few years’.
“The aim is therefore to give back to the workers the security provided by insurance, because the fate of those who suffer the accident cannot depend on where the legislators are arbitrary and where they share their actions.”
Hearing damage can cause MP3 players
It may cause permanent hearing damage by listening to portable players for longer periods of time and high volume, such as MP3 devices -
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, referring to today’s opinion published by the Scientific Committee on New and Newly identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).
“It turns out that 5-10 percent of people who have a permanent hearing loss over five years a day can listen to their portable music player with a high volume of volume – read the explanation.
“It’s worrying that young people who use portable music players and mobile phones in high volume are not aware that they can irreversibly harm their hearing,” said Meglena Kuneva.
\"The scientific surveys indicate an undisputed risk that we should urgently respond to,\" the EU Commissioner added.
The most important task is to inform consumers and disseminate information on this.
In the light of this opinion, we must also review existing control systems to ensure that they are able to function effectively and keep pace with the latest technologies.
Brussels called on the independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem in view of the spread of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people they have caused.
\"The researchers confirm that we have a reason for concern, and the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine what possible measures could be taken to protect children and young people who are exposed to noise protection by portable players and similar instruments,\" the committee said.
The European Safety Regulation currently in force in 100 dB sets out the maximum sound level available by portable music players, however, increasing concern is accompanied by data on hearing damage caused by excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise pollution, which can significantly reduce these hearing damage.
The EU Scientific Committee explains in its expert opinion that for users of portable players who listen to music with high volume (more than 89 decibels) per week, the noise price exceeds the current maximum value for noise at work.
If you listen to music for longer than five years in similar circumstances, there will be a risk of permanent hearing damage after five years.
This affects about 5-10% of the users using portable equipment, which can mean 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno sets up a committee responsible for the future of the capital city
It starts today, lasts until March, the results are expected in June.
This agenda was set up by the Capital Municipality for the operation of the Committee entitled “The Future of the Capital of Rome”, which sat at the new headquarters behind the Caracalla baths this morning.
In the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commission members will develop their Rome guidelines.
After the end of March, the study and plans will be evaluated in the General Assembly and the Board of Directors in order to present in June the strategic plan of the capital city officially approved by the Prime Minister of the Government and Gianni Alemanno.
\"This is an entirely independent committee in which all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas are represented - and Alemanno - in order to develop proposals for the development of Rome, which can be relied on by political decision-makers, including the General Assembly and the Committee on Self-government.
It is not a matter of incompatibility, but we would have liked a platform where large plans for Rome can be made.
In March, after he has done his job, the committee will be disbanded because he has a fixed term mandate.
In June, we presented a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee entitled “The Future of the Capital of Rome”, the Prime Minister said.
For those who consider the Commission to be unnecessary, referring to the fact that the opinion it sets out does not have a binding force, Alemanno answers: “Everything depends on what the Commission will do and what quality of the proposal it makes to the table.
If the standard is appropriate, as is the case in France with the Attali Commission, which I am sure of in Rome, it will play an important role in its contribution.
The power of politics is often divided into day-to-day matters, as well as urgent cases from time to time.
On the other hand, we look further, taking into account the perspective of the perspective, and plan for the longer term, and are committed to working towards the development and future of Rome.
The mayor of Rome wishes to point out that \"this Commission is not regarded as a useless \"waterhead,\" since it is completely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a euro, it will serve as an incentive to think and involve the best minds of the capital.
Alemanno believes that “there is a need for an open-end and flexible strategic framework that will enable our city to jump in a high-quality way that would require so much thinking about its future in a unified spirit.”
About the future in which the mayor of Rome emphasizes: “It will not only be limited to the current municipal frameworks, but will look far further – we will not only see the future metropolis and the capital status, but also the role that Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean can play as the capital of the Mediterranean region, and what it needs to be filled in.
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known independent American politician wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first Jimmy Carter, who decided to destroy the American economy, and had a close relationship with the American economy (as a private person today) with the enemy Islam.
As the time of the elections approaches, attacks on Obama are increasing.
A Miami lady wrote on the internet: “This man is full of ambition.
Obama believes that he can win the highest public dignity of a nation that has so far been black by two governors and five senators.
These attacks are actually nothing to say; of course, they are racist, but they do not answer the voters’ question whether they will be a good president. Then there are polls here: Obama will win, with a significant advantage.
In this case, there is someone who listens to their emotions and does not think about it.
Inside the South States, a Mississippi newspaper wrote this in his lead article: we know that the real American patriot who cast his vote in the poll.
The American mindset appears here which remains hidden until the last moment.
\"Just talk about what you want, and then we know where we're going to put the phrase, Obama, or McCain.\"
There are some who swear that if Obama wins, they will leave the United States.
Such words have never been spoken until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
However, despite all these reasonings, the Democrats’ winning weapon is George Bush himself.
1500 people were asked what were the mistakes made during Bush's term of office? 89% answered that Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 500,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and it was designed to fly to its homeland.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans didn’t have to pack.
However, the majority believe that Iraq was a weak point in Bush.
It's a huge task to find out who's in George W.'s place.
The U.S.: The economic collapse is felt by journalists, the time of restrictions in the editors. Many people blame the Internet for the print press.
The PEW Research Institute asked 500 American journalists about how they are thinking about the future situation and spiritual power of their profession.
Now, almost every journalist is pessimistic about his future.
However, they did not clearly claim that their concerns were reduced in terms of authenticity.
They don't feel so isolated as before.
The problem with American journalists is money.
They believe that the crisis in 2008 is a failure of a powerless economic model.
There is a further serious problem with the newsroom, i.e. the limitations of the newspaper-making editors.
If we do not want traditional journalism, in the sense that the great public understood it below, to shrink to a minimum, this problem must be solved,\" asked journalists said.
Nowadays, well-seen and complex pessimism describes American journalism.
Sixty percent of journalists and top executives working in the printed press are convinced that national tyrnalism is on the wrong track.
At local level, 65 percent of journalists are in top management positions.
Printed v electronic press.
The press staff do not find it difficult to see where the world's network is going.
The biggest publishers are trying to find their way to the Internet, which many people believe is the “killer” of the printed press.
The “economic pressure,” perceived by journalists, has increased to 79%.
The 500 asked journalists admitted that he would put his voks in front of the technology, hoping that it might be for the benefit of tyrnalistics.
Today, in the American press, there is a gap between editorial leaders, i.e. directors and reporters working on them.
At national level, 56% of managers are sure that their reporters will share their information with others, while this rate can only be 23% at local level.
Some of these are connected to a safe job.
At national level, 47% of managers are concerned that they may lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this rate is 30%.
In America, the question of \"safe work\" is constantly on the agenda at the level of the team (for our editors.
Only 13% of journalists have a contract.
In the case of a huge nation like the United States of 300 million inhabitants, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV, and Internet service providers work, employers generally recommend as much as they want, so the thing is “free or not” on the basis.
Directors usually get a high salary, and editors can earn 10,000 dollars a month, in addition to paying pension and health insurance fees.
Freedom, however, is a rather complicated principle: in the first year x day, also in the third until, after a certain time, it reaches the maximum of 15 days.
But American journalists, according to their own statement, often “be ill during the year.”
Everything depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: Royalty of Romania: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAGERRATABAN MARAD
Mr Rinaudo, President of the Second Penetration of the Rome Court, rejected the request of Danilo Coppola, who would have liked to go to a Roman apartment from his residence in Grottaferrata.
A investigation against Coppola is ongoing in the context of the investigation of an agreement on the exchange of shares between Unipol and BNL.
Last week, in the course of the proceedings against him, the home arrest was removed and it was changed to a ban on the refusal of residence for Grottaferrat.
Lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella have requested the real estate professional to go through the town’s capital from the rural small town.
However, according to the court, these gases (which the prosecutor has proposed to reject) would allow the company to influence and access the evidence brought against it.
The elite is in danger.
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote for the $700 billion rescue package put in by the White House: the majority of Americans were more interested and still interested in the punishment of Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is also supported by the New York Times yesterday, which reports that the current crisis has broken down within the Republican Party, which shows an increasing division between the traditional, restrained, federal and business-backed Eastern Party approach to support federal institutions and the new anti-German and financial world line in the Central and Southern states.
This direction was expressed in a critical manner during the vote on the House of Representatives referred to in the introduction.
However, this event is just one of the major changes that the economic transformation that is still taking place in the United States, not only in the Western world, but also in the rest of the world.
It seems that the crisis, in the US and in Europe, will only speed up the long-lasting phenomena that will consolidate in this new atmosphere and finally become solar.
The first such phenomenon is the re-actualisation, the re-establishment of the dual category of state sovereignty into public consciousness, the re-statement of the economy.
The crisis affects banking institutions that are in close contact with foreign countries, but mainly, and quite wide, people and families that live in a single country.
This is a direct political difficulty for those in the government: what should they respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are otherwise electors?
So, in the economic sense, the crisis seems global, but in the political sense it is almost exclusively national.
It seems that political internationalism is essentially outside the coastline: the European Union is a solid proof of this, which cannot set a uniform political direction between different interests and national strategies.
Thus, everyone expects intervention, rescue package, recovery and new rules from each national government, but primarily the opening of funds: since in a difficult situation, only individual states have economic resources, a financial set that can fix things.
They also have their tools and powers to use them: in certain circumstances, they have two invaluable sources, which are likely to have no other market and no international organization to this extent.
By the way, the new emphasis placed on the nation state by the crisis is fully consistent with the fact that economic growth in recent times is an increasingly important factor that is closely linked to this concept: this is the territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the network, the more sophisticated technology in the abstract world, and we were convinced that the global financial world was assigned to dominate the world, we only had to realize that our future was increasingly dependent on the less abstract things than water, crops and oil.
From things that can be delivered from one side of the planet to the other, yet can be fully connected to a surrounded place, an area.
So the one who controls the area has a lot more cards than the one who was born in a place where there is no crop, there is no oil and there is no water.
I would then turn to the second novelty, which is a kind of breaking line.
Those who say that the area, the state, the government, must also say: politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two cohesive phenomena:
On the one hand, the recognition of the objective is that there is a need for a credible leadership, for those who can handle the events.
On the other hand, current management, especially the economic leaders, is creating a complete loss of credit, which has proved to be completely inadequate and proven that many of them are still in a blurred area.
Together, the two are even more important and, in a certain sense, more disturbing: the feeling of credit loss, intolerance, insatiability and isolation, which affects the entire leadership institution in several Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that among the increasing population, the belief that the era of social elites at the summit has expired so far. It has expired before their actions, their experiences, their way of life, their culture, the complex sense of the word, would have taken hold of itself. In this way, the social elite is becoming more and more out of the opinion of the majority.
In the same way, the need for leadership, in the form of a cohesive, but strong democratic movement is being fed against the dominant Austrian and the traditional political system. This voters have not expected – or in recent times the sudden changes in public opinion. For example, the achievement of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, or the rebellion against American Congressarians Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right side can also be settled).
It seems that the traditional elite, its parties, its programs, and even its habits, its press and its illustrious intelligence at the university, is becoming less and less understood, and therefore it is becoming less and less capable of representing what has been going on in the deeper layers of Western society for some time. Furthermore, the economic crisis is getting stronger, expanding and potentially able to produce ever-increasing moves.
Despite this, “the insurrection of the crowds that are bound to be . . . . would be too much. . . . to speak honestly.
But with an open eye, it doesn't hurt at all.
We can go with a super strong glue on the wall
With a super powerful glue, you can defeat gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This goal was set by several US research centres, and a group of four institutions are close to the solution.
With just a 2.5 square centimeter glue, researchers managed to glue a 100 kilo body to a vertical wall and keep it there.
The American magazine TANULMÁNY - Science published the findings of a few researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the group of scientists has already been developed by the development of special, so-called carbon nanotube materials.
“The principle of glued operation must be imagined as a system similar to a package of spaghetti,” says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgian Institute of Technology.
The researchers drew the idea of the foot covered with the microscopic ladders in the gecko, which provides the perfect grip for the animal.
The tests with various materials, such as glass, teflon and glazing paper, have confirmed that the new glue is ten times more effective than the feet of the said seals, while, at the same time, “it is easily removed from the wall,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the engineering faculty of the University of Sunday.
FALON JARNI? – “This material can be useful as a temporary glue – adds Liming Dai.
We can walk on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Perhaps yes, but researchers are thinking more about a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are good for heat and electricity.
You can find more applications in space research.
Super heroes can wait.
The University of Berkeley, California, is also experimenting with a new glue material.
According to the article published in American Chemical Society C., California scientists have presented a hair-like, microfiber glue that goes through self-cleaning during movement on the surface, so it always provides a perfect grip.
It's forbidden with fruit.
Care should be taken with grapefruit, orange and alma.
These high-vitamin drinks, mainly popular in the summer, when taken with certain life-saving drugs, alter their absorption, depending on the case, by strengthening or reducing their effects. This may also have serious health consequences.
The risk of combined use of box or fresh fruit juices and certain medicinal products was raised by Professor David Bailey, professor of Western Ontario at London University of Western Ontario. The professor announced at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia on the state: a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, thereby preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the patient’s health.
Grapefruitle has been on the bench of the accused before, when it turned out that it has been able to increase the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamine, anxiety suppression, heart rhythm regulator and nerves to a toxic level.
The Italian Institute of Pharmacy brought the news to the public two years ago and also warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with this co-administration and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
No CSAK GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
A long list of active substances whose absorption is hindered by grapefruits and other fruit juices could be listed.
To this end, Michele Carruba, professor of pharmaceuticals at the University of Milan, points out: “This kind of discovery is usually immediately indicated to various national and international pharmaceutical institutions who, if necessary, will ensure that the information contained in the notice of this product is changed.
That is why we must always read the information on the intended drug and, if something is not understandable, let us not let ourselves be influenced, but we will be clearly asking our doctor or pharmacist,\" said Ansa.
Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize in Economics
Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for Economics, the analysis of the territorial contexts of commercial models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old neochemist Krugman, Princeton University, is a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the best critics of the economic and foreign policy measures of the Bush Government.
After the September 2001 terrorist attack, a few months after Enron went bankrupt, Krugman announced in the new York Times that the last event would have even more decisive consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of twin towers.
This forecast was not a little debate, but it has been put in the eyes of economists for several times, but today we know it was accurate.
“I am surprised and a little shocked that the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom has gone beyond public interest,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a \"popantly valuable economist\", but in a rather aggressive style, spreads the criticisms of the Bush government's excessive liberalism.
Open Office, the third edition of the “Microsoft Anti-Pack”
Today, OpenOffice.org 3.0 presents an open code of application that increases personal productivity, targeting more and more layers as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, from freelancers to public administration.
After almost a year of work done by SUN Microsystem and by volunteer developers, the new Open Office brings several novelties to the public: on the welcome screen and beyond the rethinked, less spontaneous user interface, it also offers several essential innovations. For example, the compatibility of Apple Mac OS X with the operating system, as well as supports the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format of the new ISO standard.
Particular attention has been paid to the compatibility with Office 2007, so Open Office can open new-wide Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interestingly, some modules have a specific feature, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint tutorials. This can be useful for sending files by email. Another feature supports the import of PDF files into a graphic module, while maintaining the site layout.
However, on this interface, you can also create PDF documents, which combine the typical Adobe format with table manager or text editor elements.
The sharing within applications has also gone through a number of improvements: the table manager supports the common use of workbooks, but prevents the overwriting of each other's work. The comment of each employee is marked with a different color, which helps to make it easier to recognize in the control phase.
Some companies already work to make OpenOffice a few features available on the Internet (on the cloud, on the cloud), so the final version will probably be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, after you have been on the side of the terror sites since Friday, has been downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
The software package is also available for Linux in addition to standard Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
We can take over the installation CD either at our home or at our workplace.
With regard to the spread of the home application, freedom is probably the greatest attraction, but the Open Office program package is now trying to kick the ball in the business sector, as it can count on a number of administrative and school projects.
There is no lack of ideal education, advice and services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business prospects.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, text editor suitable for Word; Calc, table manager for Excel replacement; Impress, Powerpoint presentations; Dbase is the most well-known, Access database manager; and eventually, Draw is the graphic module.
The 2008 target is to achieve 5 million downloads. However, if we consider that we are already at 3.600,000 with the release of the new version, this number will probably be higher than expected.
Kohl’s result is also positive, this is the fourth doping case.
At the latest stage of Tour de France, one of the participants, the Austrians Bernhard Kohl, competing in the colours of the Gerolsteiner team, who won the best mountain walk in addition to the bronze.
The news was on the website of the Equipe Internet.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth competitor, the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepol, and the German Gerolsteiner contestant Stefan Schumacher, who held the third generation version of EPO to produce positive results on the Cera test.
Kohl's blood samples, like the tests in the last few weeks, were tested by labs inlausanne and Chatenay.
If the control tests also confirm the positive Cera result, Austria will lose its third position and, according to the rules, will be banned from racing for two years.
The news on the positive outcome of the Kohl’s third generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, the head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and the Associated Press news agency said that he indicated the positive doping result towards the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrians managed to stand behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the U.S. Cadel Evans and also won the best mountain turtle.
What about NEW YORK?
In Italy, only recently changed to one of the most popular targets of immigrants who have been accepted as a prisoner.
Is this the question of the New York Times, based on the case of Abdul William Guibre in Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan last month because he stole a box of biscuits, devoted a long article to the debate about racism in Italy.
The case is well-known as the paradox of the New York Times, which says that in the northern regions, “the strongest is integration and the highest is employment – at the same time “the anti-immigrantism and the support of the Northern League” is also the strongest in the country.
In order to support the increasing tension between the Italians and immigrants, NYT also quotes cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws required by the League, which would bring the lawn closer to immigration and facilitate the removal of illegal immigrants, were set as an example of mood change in Italy.
The said trend was highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: “Giorgio Napolitano met with XVI Benedes in the Quirinale Palace and said that the state and the Church would work together to defeat racism.”
Students suffer from expensive rental fees and can spend up to €900 in a room
The market for accommodation for university students is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the Finnish Trade Association, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
“The phenomenon has now been so amazing that, due to the enormous total costs for families, students are closed away from the possibility of learning,” explains Laura Mariani, head of the study office of Sunia. “In these cities, the high demand for students has distorted the market to the extent that a general process of gliding has been launched against local residents.
In most cases, real estate offers also contain a number of irregularities: non-registered contracts with no lease limit, with a linked subcontractor.
According to Sunia, an extraordinary measure would be needed to maximise prices by reviewing the tax system.
The details of the survey show that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, a single room costs 450 euros; the price of a single room ranges from 650 euros (area of Bande Nere) to 800 euros (Lathiate, Udine and Fiera), but you can also reach 900 euros (area of Vittoria).
In Florence, a bed room costs a average of 350/400 euros, with a room of about 700.
In Bologna, where the majority of students live in the area close to the university, a bed costs 250/280 euros, if it is double and 370-500 euros, if it is a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), a single and 450 is requested for a bed in a double room.
They are somewhat cheaper (550 euros a single room) with prices around other universities (Ostiense and Cinecità).
In the suburbs you can save everything: 300 euros are spent in a bed and 450 in a single room in Prnestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, you will be asked for 300/450 euros for a bedroom, from 400 to 600 euros for a room. The lowest price is in the area of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
Bari has to pay 250/350 euros for a bed and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute value, but represent a greater weight within the city's budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students from outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, there is another disorder: the rental fee for foreign students is about 25-30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
Good-bye to the old Cinema Paradiso, the time of the old cinema halls in the cities
Traditional cinemas are closed for the benefit of the Multiplexes.
“A city where there are no cinemas, a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
The images produced by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively show everything that goes through in the Italian cities, but also in rural regions.
Depression of the cinema - the appearance of large multi-thermal cinemas in the suburbs, and consequently the distribution of single-thermals in the city centers - is an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time, it bears all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
When places full of history and memories disappear, “it’s as if a friend is gone, a friend with whom we shared our journey and many experiences,” says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which, 20 years ago, was an Oscar award, and a grand prize for the Cannes festival, tells the story of a small-town cinema in Libya, a passion after a movie that may have been lost forever.
The largest association of operators, the data provided by Anec, clearly speaks: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas closed. The biggest loss was recorded in the cinemas in large cities: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin, and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 single-term cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And that, for their disappearance, the rise of multiplexes is no more evident than that in the three regions of Italy the highest number of newly opened multi-thermal cinemas: in the last five years, the number of rooms in Lombardy, 81 in Tuscany, and the same in Emilia-Romagna.
“The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally,” says President Paolo Protti. “It is clear that we are building new facilities, but the survival of existing ones should also be ensured, because when a city cinema is closed, not all the doors are willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the outstanding financial funds intended to support operators: the State's outstanding debt can be approximately EUR 10 million.
From an ethical and moral point of view, it is also embarrassing that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
In order to maintain the market, between €16 and €18 million would be needed.
This is the first Italian city that decided to remedy the problem through an agreement between the municipality and Anec in order to protect and restore single-room cinemas in the city.
The provisions would include tax incentives for operators and the benefits to the public to facilitate access: viewers can park in restricted zones and in certain parking areas.
\"I do this initiative,\" says Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities, even by introducing other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
However, it is also certain that traditional cinemas, in order to be able to fight the multiplex rule, must improve the sound and image quality, because today’s audience is much more demanding.
The preservation of the traditional cinema was always an important question for me: the closure of the Supercinema in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and youth age, gave me the spark that eventually made the Cinema Paradiso, although I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the via Nazionale in front of the closed Rialto or Quirinale, so that I don't see the stained posters from the dust, I'd rather turn my head away.
Close strands between politics and the 'ndrangheta' were arrested by Mayor Gioia Tauro
“Gioia Tauro’s mayor supported the interests of the Piromodel-klan in municipal decisions.”
Major and Deputy Mayor of Gioia Tauro, Gyorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone and Mayor Carlo Martelli of Rosarno, who were arrested this morning for external participation in the criminal union.
Bilincs was taken into the hands of Gioacchino Piro, a senior mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as a lawyer’s nephew, who was previously convicted of participating in a mafia-like crime union, and received compensation of €10 million.
“Absolute all legal and moral rules, which is more of a good taste,” states state prosecutors. The two local authorities announced their intention to pay advice to Piromodel lawyer.
“That would have been the official course of the clan’s visit to the city hall, which would have given further opportunity to control and manage public administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, the president of the General Assembly of the region of Calabrian, does not hide that there is a number of collusions between local institutions and the organized underworld: There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where the collusion is almost inevitable.
Many local politicians, however, resist the pressure of the 'ndrang', are the heroes who remain clear.
Today’s morning arrests are the continuations of events in July, when the police announced that the Piro Model clan was successful.
At the end of April, local politicians were exempted from their mandate for the administration of the municipality. In 1991, the municipal committee of Gioia Tauro was once disbanded, even because of the alleged conflicts between organised crime and local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democratic mayor of the disbandation, took the lead in the second round of 2006 in the middle right coalition.
He shouted a scandal when the County House ordered the dissolution of the municipal committee.
He referred to the Court of Justice the former Minister of Interior Marco Minnini and accused him of designing everything with a political goal. But the court stated in the arrest order signed this morning that the Piromodel-klan had been bold enough to demand the change of the A3 project.
From a hearing with Dal Torrione, the state prosecutors say that “there was an extensive group of entrepreneurs who were known to be close to the Piromodel family to comply with the demands of the company, to subscrib the decisions of the municipality to the clan interest.”
Energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come.
An inexhaustible source of energy, which represents 70% of the planet's surface, and which is still being discovered by major international energy companies.
Hullams, sea currents, floods, and renewable energy that giants have thrown their eyes on like Chevron, who are now trying to shake their hands.
They have been exploring the possibility of winning energy from sea movements for hundreds of years. In the '70s, during the first oil crisis, research has increased.
Around 1980, when oil prices were reduced, the idea of using marine energy has been set aside, but today the re-initiating demand for environmental protection and the price of oil has given the industry a new boost.
According to the London World Energy Council (WEC) 2007 estimates that 15 percent of the world's electricity demand could be covered by facilities using sea wave.
This amount is twice what nuclear power plants are currently producing.
In addition, the currents and floods would still be there.
The giants are in the air.
Enersis was the first company to commit to marine energy and signed an agreement on a power plant in North Portugal in 2005.
It seemed like a revolutionary step when the signature was announced.
It has been two years since, and more and more companies have been putting up with marine energy, including those who have been committed to traditional energy so far.
“Cevron is studying ocean energy technologies and considering the possibility of cooperation with us,” said the spokesman for one of the American oil giant’s co-operative companies, Wall Street Journal.
The cooperation in question concerns the acquisition of the permission to launch the sub-project for the exploitation of marine energy issued by the US Energy Committee.
This is not a small issue, especially if we consider that the U.S. is currently producing oil in Alaska, and even President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. and Ocean Power from New Jersey are the way out of the sea.
Technology is waiting for development.
According to experts, it is still an initial technology, just because the energy obtained from the sea does not dispel concerns about the environmental impact.
The existing facilities, such as Portugal or Scotland, are all small, and therefore do not cause too much problems with the ecosystem.
In order to generate energy in larger scales, there is a need for facilities with a significant environmental impact.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a combined bonus system.
The blows that the waves create and move the ankles into the hydraulic pressure of the plungers and cylinders placed inside them.
The pressure is a turbine that feeds a generator.
The electric current reaches the ground on the underwater cables.
At the same time, there are four similar facilities in the planning phase, which are already waiting for a federal permit. Some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, began to produce energy for a mall and a parking lot with six submarine turbines located in the New York East River.
At the time of the flood, the movement of water rotates the mats of turbines, and this rotation feeds the generator.
Verdant said he had a long list of partners waiting for permission to use energy only.
It's a flood after the shocks.
Currently, we deserve to pay particular attention to the opportunities that can be used through the flood.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves, it is considered to be a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, spent $7.5 million in 2008 on the exploitation of energy provided by the flood. This is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
