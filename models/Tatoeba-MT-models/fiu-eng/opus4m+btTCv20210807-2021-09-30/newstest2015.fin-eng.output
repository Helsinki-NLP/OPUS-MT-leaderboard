Putin: Ukrainian troops shooting civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Kiev of refusing direct political talks with the Eastern Ukrainian separatists on Monday.
At this moment, Kiev's leadership does not want to carry out an essential political debate with the eastern part of its country,\" Putin said, according to the news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said that the Russian-minded separatists, which Kiev and the West say were aided by the Russian army, tried to push the Ukrainian troops further away from their moments in which Putin said the Ukrainian army forces were shooting civilians.
The goal of the militants is to push out these armed forces and their artillery so as not to be able to shoot the inhabitants of the region, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmi Choir Station.
It surprised me that the crowd came from the very beginning of the evening.

Cancer of the ovaries is more often killed in less populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video of honor to her mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in Australia have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers visited over 1,100 Australian women with ovarian cancer diagnosis in 2005 and found that only 35% of women, or more than five years after diagnosis.
The main researcher at Susan Jordan QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in rare residential and remote areas died 20 percent more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
VIEW: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers went through women’s health history over seven years.
According to Doctor Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status also affected the possibility of survival.
The likelihood of survival was lowest in older women and when cancer was more common at the time of the diagnosis.
Women living in rare and remote areas died 20 percent more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not attempt to determine why women living outside the city have a lower likelihood of survival from ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers it possible for reasons of delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment.
“Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their reception is mostly in big cities,” Jordan said.
While treatment as remote services is becoming more common and the importance of distances decreases, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their home, as well as programs to support patients who are being treated far from home.
According to a study by Dr. Jordan, the survival rate of women with ovarian cancer for a long time is poor regardless of geographical location, stressing the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, family mother Elisha Neavella, a 33-year-old, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the design of a gym park in the Friendship Park, located next to the hotel in Pohjanhovi.
On Monday, the City Government decided that the proposal for a status plan for the Friendship Park and its surrounding environment would be placed at the public service point in Osvitta.
The draft proposal is requested by the environmental committee and the Lapland Ely Centre.
With the help of the design change, the city wants to enable the continuation of motorcycling activities related to tourism in the region.
It is intended to form a park area that keeps the area between the current Friendship Park and its and the river.
On the spot, no more than 200 motormobiles shall be allowed for the period from 15 November to 30 April.
You can also place fuel stations on the designated part of the area.
The new park area is also allowed for maintenance.
The city of Rovaniemi has rented the area of Friendship Park for safari companies for motor racing during wintertime.
The lease agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and the agreement is in force in spring 2018.
Cottage-parking and design change have also led to loud opposition.
Residents of neighbouring floors have been hungry for both voting and worrying about emissions.
However, the emissions of the area have been investigated and no observations beyond the guidance values have been made in the surveys.
The new equipment is even more low-emission.
As a park area of friendship, it is also supported that if the starting point was moved further away, the safari customers of the hotel should carry safari to the safari departures by buses, which would be estimated at 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and the surrounding environment of the Friendship Park are also large enough, better than the places shown for replacement departures, such as the east side of the Ounasjoki bridges.
It is also good for its location that the activities can be extended in the future, for example in the Ounaspaviljong area.
The establishment of parking activities is part of the urban strategy adopted by the Rovaniemi City Council, which aims to create, inter alia, a good framework for business activities by providing adequate quality areas to logistically and functionally affordable places.
The friendship park is also marked as the starting point of motor racing, also a part of the city centre, which has not yet received the law.
The decline in property is seen in garden stores
The decrease in the number of apartment owners, in particular in the group of people under 35, may lead to a reduction in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions, when today’s young consumers reach their age in favour of the garden sales – the main target group – the Financial Times reported a study by the UK Garden Trades Association (HTA).
According to the Financial Times report, only 55% of the money spent by the owners of the apartment is used for gardening.
The study also showed that more and more people live in highly urbanised apartments with no gardens. In addition, the garden’s size decreases, when the courtyard is increasingly covered as a parking place. These factors also threaten the garden industry, which is estimated to be around £5 billion a year.
In the large area of London, the ownership of apartments has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, with less money per household being spent on garden products in the whole country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), the increase in the rental of apartments or the reduction in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the leading garden advisor at RHS, says that, for example, plants grown in transferable farming containers are particularly popular among residential rentals, as such farming can be included in their change if necessary.
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were the flowering period for the resale of the garden sector, as the ownership and wealth of the apartments increased from the late 80s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that this year, due to better weather conditions, the weather in March and April last year is bad.
Turkey is questioning a U.S. diplomat for a spy report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the country’s most experienced U.S. diplomat to report a report on the spying by the Americans and the British in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the U.S. Ambassador and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German Der Spiegel and the Webpaper The Intercept have written that the documents of the former analyst Edward Snowden revealed Turkey as the main spy target for U.S. and UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoga reduced the significance of the report, saying that all major states have stabilised each other.
The previous report on the spying of the German main intelligence service Ankara was a more angry reaction to the Turkish government.

Mallorcan Magaluf Police Chief of the Crime of Corruption
The evidence provided by the police and the city government officials of Calvià showed a blackmail at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià, located on Mallorca holiday, has been arrested as a result of the corruption charges presented by the known Magluf movement and barowners.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several movementists on the Punta Ballena street presented corruption charges against him. The Punta Ballena street is located in most of the Magaluf bars and nightclubs.
According to Mallorca Diario, a daily newspaper published on the network, the evidence of the indictment of police officers and the city government officials of Calvià presented evidence of the indictment of Mallorca's anti-corruption prosecutor's office on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and they are interrogated with the judge Navarro.
The entire country's journal ABC wrote about the bias of the angry authorities of the owners of nightclubs, which made their business very difficult.
“There is no more money in it, but the survival, a movementist said to the court.
You're not destroying our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magluf was in several countries in the headlines of magazines this summer, when YouTube video was released online, where an 18-year-old British vacationer engaged in oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to control the drunk and uncontrolled use of Magaluf holidayers by reducing the number of participants in malicious, alcohol-crawlies pub crawlies.
In addition, the Playhouse Night Club, where the oral video was photographed, was set to close for a year, and a fine of EUR 55,000 was imposed on Carnage, the owner of the nightclub and the organizer of the pub crawl.
Above all, the popular Magluf tourist destination among young British tourists has also become popular in the so-called balconing trend, which has caused several alcohol abuse accidents when people have jumped from the balcony to the other or balcony to the hotel’s pool.
The children of Israel return to school after the war of Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and grenades bombed their communities in the 50-day Israeli and Hamas wars, and schools remained closed when the region recovered from battles.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in the communities of southern Israel bombarded by rockets, but the signs of battle are still visible.
At the Pashosh Day Home in Ashdod, South, workers removed the fragments of fragments from the walls and slides before the arrival of the children in the building was hit by the building.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re excited, too,” says Ronit Bart, who lives in a cyberbully called Saad, an Israeli communion, and works as an English teacher in the city’s school.
Many children in this area need routines.
According to Bart's 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart, a return to school in a long time seems strange.
“We’ve had difficult times when we didn’t leave home, he says.
President Reuven Rovlin visited the border of Gaza for his support.
Before the start of the ceasefire last week, thousands of inhabitants of the Saad-like border communities had kept in their homes or left their homes to safer areas from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community in the vicinity of the Gaza Strip are doubtful about the return of the Palestinian grenade killed by a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, ten families had not returned yet.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, near the border of Gaza, which was the subject of a heavy Palestinian settlement.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised to take care of the training and safety of children.
Israel and Hamas agree to the ceasefire in force on Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately stopped the battle, but it did not solve many key issues, such as Hamas' demand for the removal of the island of Israel and Egypt and the re-opening of the air and sea roads of Gaza.
Israel wants to remove Hamas from the weapons and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers who have fallen in war.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
Palestinian and UN estimates that more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of the dead, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it had no solid evidence of this.
On Israel, 66 soldiers and six civilians died, including Thai workers.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers shot 4 591 rockets and grenades in Israeli cities mostly in the south.
The Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and approximately 250,000 people fled to protect over 100 UN schools that had been transformed into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and as the battle continued, the school authorities moved the beginning of the school in the last week.
“I hope that the school will soon open up and get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like the Jewish children,” said the 13-year-old Mohammed Amara, a school in Gaza.
According to a commonly used meter, the prices of the apartments have risen to the highest of seven years in the winter months of Australia.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index, measuring the prices of the apartments in Australia, rose by 1.1% in August, showed RP data on Monday.
The increase in prices during summer, July and August was 4.2 per cent, more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9%, which is more than twice as much as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not steadily risen across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, Research Director of RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price rise.
RP Data results show that housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and 11.7 per cent in Melbourne last year.
Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin’s housing markets are the next most vibrant; the average price rise is from 5 to 6 per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose only 1.4% per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that started in Australia increases the number of apartments in sales over the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
“In view of the rise in the sales of the auctioned apartments, the generally lively sales pace and the continued low interest rates, it is likely that the increase in housing prices will continue in the next three months,” Lawless said.
The new Gösta Museum has led record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and image art have drawn record audiences this summer from Mäntä.
The Serlachius Art Museum has visited more than 70,000 guests by the end of August.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and there have been, among other things, the classic works of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mäntt’s visual arts week, on Monday, announced that he had made a visitor’s record, while this summer he was visiting 14 500 interested.
These figures are not used.
People have been strangled from doors and windows,\" says Pauli Sivonen of Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors for the whole year will come to the Serlachius museums this year to approach hundreds of thousands.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
The Mäntä-Vilppula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
The museum director Sivonen reminds us that the new museums are always opening up the phenomena.
“The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent,” he says.
It is hoped that the age of art will continue far over the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened.

Lost Amphetamine Caused Murder in Kajaan
The disappearance of a few ten grams of amphetamines resulted in the murder of a Cayan man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to the apartment with his open partner and another man and shot the owner of his apartment, a 34-year-old Caucasian woman, who was a drug exporter.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed to have been a second man as a shooter.
The case came to the police when the police department stopped the passenger car, where the company was burning the clothes used in the blood work.
In addition to burnt clothing, there was a cut-off hammer in the car.
Kainuu's right to judge the case later.
August was rare in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, August is repeated on average once a year.
According to the statistics of the Finnish Meteorological Institute, the average temperature was higher than the usual in the whole country.
Most of the country's deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the beads of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the whole summer was measured in the first week of August in Por, where the meter looked at 33.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, \"My father never embraced me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born to a family of seven children from Jamaica in Dudley, England, in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry is currently practicing for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, partly based on his father's imaginary discussion and developed on the basis of the Radio 4 channel series.
The sound track is a mix of reggae and ramps in the upbeat paces.
Henry has had to go through some painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times since his mother died, and he is considering a lot of his relationship with his father.
My father was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, only the voice said, \"Stop the noise.\"
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at the Cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the form of a beer bath or the beauty of a cocktail night.
I never talked to him about things like that.
Most of my life he was the smileless man in the corner for me, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal alloy in Dudley and thus got the idea of what his father's life must have been, although working conditions are better now than at that time.
Sulatams are a little brighter today, but they are practically dark, smoke-like, labyrinth-like depths, where they eat flames, smoke and dolls, and bring to mind the soul.
The father used to go to the bath and just to the ground in the pool, and quietly he started singing to himself when he washed the molten dirt out of himself.
As I walked around Sulatamo, I realized that he had been doing this work for years to get us a table of food, and I started to appreciate him more.
However, Henry’s childhood was lacking in the closeness of parents.
My father never hugged me and never said he loved me.
Only when my mother started to get sick a little before she died, we began to start to show each other that we loved each other.
Henry has Billie's daughter, Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love he lacked as a child.
Do you always have to repeat – I love you –
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry is still a good friend with French, whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why would Dawn and I not be friends?
He's a great mother.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to the death of the mother.
When I started suffering from heavy overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
After that, I began to exercise a lot, and I also had to start a tough diet to reduce the symptoms.
It’s very difficult –
And boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard may be a picture of his change during his career development.
After critics get a lot of good feedback about their role in Otellona, he is immersed in making the theatre.
The next step was the comedy of the Wrongs and the Fences of August Wilson.
Making a theater offers a different experience than Sitcoms and Comedys that Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started the industry when he was only 16 years old.
One of them saw him on stage in imitations and contacted the New Faces Skills Competition.
Henry's television career began in the mid-70s. \"How long have I been the only black simulator and comedian on television,\" he says.
Henry learned the job when he was doing it.
I had to grow up in the light of publicity, I had to learn how to make jokes from sliding straps between 1975 and 1985, while the body was starring and I was on television. It was a difficult time.
the Lenny New Faces Skills Competition 1975
Henry's manager had the right to play the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared in black dresses, so Henry ended up in a comedian program for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was weird and difficult, I was able to work in huge events and learn how to deal with the audience.
Yet, the award-winning, multi-annual favorite and light entertainment program of the Brittish TV was at the same time an exciting parade of black people.
Henry worked in a second comedy series in the 80s, where he was both spoiled and admired by black British culture.
The Lenny Henry Show was released in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was known as a cook Gareth Blacklock as a comedy chef!
Henry spent the next decade on ads, documents, TV series and films, but after his 2009 LennyHenry.tv series in BBC, he said to himself: “What are you going to do next, Len – now it seems that the trails are only standing or traveling on the sidelines –
The next turn was the radio 4 series “What’s So Great About . . . .
The first part covered Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not properly taught to us at school, and I think it belonged to a white middle class that uses socks and has money.
That's why Shakespeare made me afraid.
All the people we interviewed on the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me: “Look.
Don't give up the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Meet the words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 of Othello's last speech for a document and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It felt almost as if some of me had intervened before, and now it was put in place.
\"This is what this is about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background research.
So the practice process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The show was finally a success.
It seems to have been expected to fail, but it didn’t exactly happen.
Soon after, Henry played the main part in the Comedy of the Wrongs comedy.
Suddenly, I was at the British National Theatre, and I couldn’t really believe it.
At one point, I thought, \"Oh, you've changed,\"
At one time, there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that his task was to entertain the audience.
“A small voice in my mind said to me, ‘You have to do it 10 minutes alone until the computer is working again.’”
Instead, the director announced that the proposal will continue as soon as the problem has been corrected.
I walked out of the scene, and some of me felt relief.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
\"You are part of the play, stay in your role...
Henry - Fences - The Duchess Theatre
The learning of the mountains was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes people more sustainable.
This also was well received, so it was like a sign of the gods; “This is what you must do.”
This is what Henry says with a voice.
So I decided to stay here.
I sincerely love this work.
I love training rooms.
However, Henry is still basically a comedian: small humorous boys constantly interrupt our conversation when he switch from imitation to another.
The arrest of the Stand-up Commissioner is a matter of will, as it seems dangerous to receive immediate thanks to an unknown audience.
If you are constantly thirsty for it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when it feels like it, but generally it no longer inspires me in the same way as before.
I'm asking Henry if he's going to go on a new stand-up tour.
I have a real pleasure sitting with the director that helps to shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey, and I don’t think I ever want to give up on that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like acting...
It's really funny.
They keep telling the story, and I enjoy it.
I love stories.

Kenya prepares a register of officials to remove the ghost workers.
Kenya has started to create a biometric register of officials trying to remove the \"mini workers\" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, the government statement announced.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid after they have left their official duties.
President Uhru Kenyatta promised to stop the corruption of the public sector after taking office in 2013.
Earlier this year’s audit found that the cost of the remuneration and other financial abuse was at least $1 million per month.
The government suspects that wages will be paid to the account after the person has died or left office, BBC’s Wanyama Chebusiri reports about the capital city of Nairobi.
All officials should report themselves to the register over the next few weeks in the identification centres to ensure that their information is stored in biometric registration format, the government's notice was reported.
According to the statement, all who refuse to do so without proper reason will be removed from the salary lists.
“This measure significantly rationalises the public sector, as this determines how many people really work in their duties, and also clears the list of wages at both levels of the government. This is how to solve the problem of “morning workers”, says Anne Waiguru, the office of the minister responsible for dispersal and planning.
The result of the 2015 financial year of the Walljoki may remain EUR 25,5 million in deficit unless the city adjusts its operations and the development of its expenditure in a tense economic situation.
On the basis of the current budget preparation, the annual population remains around 9.4 million deficits.
As a potential means of improving the scope and level of services, the purchase of services, the sale of assets and grants, and the increase in tax and payment products.
The EUR 10 million target of investment is 8.5 million.
The situation of the municipality is not allowed relief.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, increased unemployment and a 5% reduction in state shares will further weaken the outlook.
The aim of the Economic Seminar is to look for new ways to balance the economy.
The Government of the City is unanimous on the need to achieve savings.
The ship must be translated into a strategy target, says Kimmo Heinonen, chairman of the city government.
The Government of the City returned the submissions to be prepared by the Management Board.
The proposals of the City Government are based on the preparation of the budget at the Council’s economic seminar in Fram on Monday 8 September.
After the presidency seminar, the draft budget will proceed through the Board of Directors to the City Government and to the City Council.
Tens of the Turkish police arrested as suspects – a drink – against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey for plots against the government, local media sources say.
The police did not comment immediately.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were arrested.
Some of the police were in contact with last December's corruption investigation aimed at government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey for organising a large-scale criminal offence and monitoring of phones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as Prime Minister at that time) said police activities are part of the planned action of the Islamic leader Fethulah Gullen against him and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most of the schools opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is a traditional day for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told the expected journalists that not all schools had re-opened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for generations to come:
The first September ceremonies were not spent in every school.
There is no peace in all Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge Ukrainian front, must be fought for peace.
Aleksandan Pastekhov, who is a leading teacher at the Slaviansk school, where Yatsenyuk's daughter goes, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back here and that children can learn something that will benefit them in the future.
The celebration of the first day of school traditionally includes children’s written shirts, balloons, and giving flowers to teachers.
Texas Perry said the twiit was unauthorized.
The Twitter account confirmed by Governor Rick Perry, Texas, was sent on Sunday evening with a stunning picture of the Democrats' district attorney in the middle of this hearing of the allegations of abuse of power.
Tweet was removed later, followed by a new tweet where Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweet was sent unauthorizedly from my account.
“I don’t accept the tweet and I’ve removed it, the later publication said.
Perry's backup team did not respond immediately to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who published the picture.
The first tweet included a dazzling joke of Travis's district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of a drunk drink in April 2013.
Perry prevented Lehmberg's funding when he refused to resign, which led to a large jury meeting in Austin this month when Perry was accused. Perry is a potential candidate for 2016 presidential elections.
The title of Tweet was: “I don’t always drive drunk, three times allowed with larger proportions... but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry on pointing his finger at him.
I'm Texas's most humorous Democrat.
The Lemberg Office did not lead a large jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antionia, ordered by the Republican judge.
Perry said he was innocent and called accusations political.
His influential legal team has asked the judge to reject the accusations and said that the law on the basis of which the governor of Texas was accused of being held was unclear against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state aid to a public inviolability unit operating in the travis County and indicted public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry’s decision led the left-wing monitoring team to make an official complaint on the matter.
Perry’s confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes famously.
After reaching fifth place at the Iowa Election Conference during his 2012 presidential election campaign, Perry threatened to finish the tie-up by publishing a picture of himself on Twitter on the lake, the text “Here comes, South Carolina.
Berkeley says the housing market is normal again.
One of London’s most important builders has warned that the South-East England housing market has “reduced” to a normal level of activity.
The capital of London’s apartments has been troubled by huge demand and a sharp rise in prices while being afraid of a wide spread credit bubble, which allowed the Bank of England to impose restrictions on housing loans in June.
Tony Pidgeley, founder and chairman of the High-Level Builder Berkeley, said Monday that, from the beginning of the current financial year, the market and the volume of shops have returned to normal after the 2013 peak, adding that this has enabled a \"serious operating environment\".
During the recession in London's housing market, foreign investors were able to reach the capital by herds.
According to data from the land register, the prices of apartments in the city rose by 18.5% only in the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7%.
The average sales prices of Berkeley’s private, affordable and student buildings increased by about one-fifth in the previous year, reaching a price increase of £423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London properties a less attractive object in recent months - some of the interest has also been influenced by new real estate taxes and political rhetoric of the possible \"mapanover tax\" before the general elections in May.
Last week, London real estate broker Foxtons warned that the April Housing Loan Report, where a tighter loan order was reported, would lead to a lower market growth level for both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
The recent information from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the amount of loans accepted decreased in July, indicating the cool housing market.
The real estate agent Hamptons International has calculated the 2015 forecast for the prices of properties in London, according to which prices fall by three per cent, as the index measuring the prices of apartment owners has already started to decline.
The number of transactions made in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen in the fourth quarter of the year, the real estate broker WA Ellis says.
However, home demand in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, which increased income from sold properties to over 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added that the demand for the right product in the best position has remained stable, and therefore sales have remained lively.
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April. This is almost a third more than at the peak of the pre-economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax gains increased by 40% year-on-year, thus by £380 million and net sales increased by 18% to 1.6 billion.
Pidgley said Monday before the company’s annual meeting that Berkeley’s annual earnings correspond to current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the profit before tax for the whole year is £450 million.
Berkeley's stock sold at London's stock exchange at a steady price of £23.96 in the afternoon.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's nudity images online.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th Annual Academy Awards.
A hacker who claims to be holding hundreds of other reasons leaked pictures of Oscar actress Jennifer Lawrence's invading online.
A hunger-free representative confirmed that the images are authentic and condemned the hacker-sucking privacy infringement.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will get the charges.
The images that were originally released on the 4chan photo release page had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple iCloud recording system. The list of dozens of other women, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed, is claimed to be the reason for the other hacking.
It is not known how much of the images are real, but Scott Pilgrim against the World Star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
“For those who look at my and my husband’s home in privacy years ago, I hope you have a good feeling, Winstead tweeted.
However, the Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon’s “iCarly” and “Victorious” series denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that “these so-called nudity images of me are a WORDER, don’t you understand?”
Let me end this right now.
On Sunday, BuzzFed announced that the representative of the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the images of the star.
Just a welcome to Howard Jacobson for a new novel that tells us about love and the J-book.
They dissolved, it pictured the best of what happened, gradually they separated from each other as a box of cardboard left out of the rain.
Only then did he hear from the woman that she was too serious, too heavy, intense, separated, and perhaps a little bit too sharp.
That's when he threw his hand.
He recognized the little one.
Yes, he was as tall as a wing.
His last victim was at the beginning a relationship that had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have made it easier for his loneliness, and it might have brought even some content of his life.
Ailin's Solomons had unscrupulous hair, and he was a delicately tender beauty with a cheerful heart, from the northern village, which was even more bitter and distant than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older travel partner, which Kevern assumed to be his aunt. Aunt had inherited a house that was located in a wet but paradise valley, and the name of the valley was suitable for Paradise Valley.
There was no one in the house for years.
The tubes leaked, in all bathrooms there were spiders, the Ethans had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place on their own, in the garden grew weeds, which resembled giant cabbage.
The cabin was like a rain of children, at the same time threatening and magical, garden full of secrets.
The author said: Howard Jacobson, a novel J – is nominated for the Booker Prize in 2014.
The proposals will be published next week
Kevern had sat in hand with Ailinn in a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening with a decentralised reception, through which the whole country heard a relaxing music and calming news, when Alinn's crossed, the sun's brown feet brought Kevern to the mind of a song that had long been sung by a forgotten black-faced performers, and which his father had often listened to the tinctures at the bottom of the cottage.
Your leg is too big.
These songs were basically too aggressive and were no longer played in the receiver.
They were not banned – nothing was strictly prohibited – they were not just called anymore.
They wanted to leave it behind, just like the word unhola.
The general opinion brought about what was not achieved by law and declaration: just as in the context of literature, people chose to read the memoirs of heroes, cookbooks, and romances, they favor the ballads for music.
Kevern began to tap the imaginary piano and sing the serenadia for the big legs of Ailin with a loud comedy voice.
I didn't understand.
\"It was the famous song of Fats Waller,\" Kevern told him, and, naturally, raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was how his father had always done before he had escaped from his lips in a letter.
It started as a game between him and his father while he was little.
His father told me he played the same game with his father.
If you let a word start with your mouth j, and you didn't remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game at the time, and it wasn't even it now.
He knew he was waiting for it, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
I had never heard of that.
Jazz was not actually declared banned, it wasn’t just called.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room for one word in life.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It had been the same way for Noah.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the cleverness of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10 years, jazz music had become familiar with him through his father's half-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Alilin that Fats Waller was black.
Given the age of Ailin, it was likely that he did not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or sanctions.
The famous society meant that each of its parts accepted, thankfully, that they had saved themselves as a happy trade, the principle that each group did natural things to it.
Based on their temperaments and physical properties, African Caribbean family roots are best suited for entertaining and sports, so they sing and run.
Originally, those from the Indian continent were like natural talent with electrical equipment, so it was their task to ensure that every family had a functioning phone that was used to handle things.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last of the Greeks broke the plate.
When SE, WHAT THE WORDS, THE WORD OF THE WORDS, went on to prove that they were from the Gulf of Persia and the Middle East, were native to those whose grandparents had not fled with great anxiety in the fear that they would be accused of sprawling flames and, in the fear that the flames would reach them next, opened up restaurants serving the Labneh yoghurt and burned the water pipe, and continued their lives lookings on the ground created and bored.
Everyone should act according to their gifts.
Ailin had only heard the Ballads, and it was difficult for him to understand how the insulting words of Kevern’s just singing could ever have been dressed as music.
The music showed love.
\"They're not really offensive,\" Kevern said.
Except maybe the bigfoots think.
My father never offended anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of giant cabbage-top leaves.
I still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to raise two fingers on his lips with Alinn.
I thought she was weird already.
“My father thought it was fun,” he said instead.
His head was unbeliefed, and his hair covered Kevern's field of sight.
Nothing else to see around the world than Ailin's huge, lean hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
“If you say so, he said but didn’t sound convinced.
It doesn’t explain why you sing it to me.
He seemed to be really confused.
Are my legs so big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, \"I love you, but it was too early for that.
You're attractive to me because of your thick ankles, he tried to fix the situation.
I'm a little twisted in that sense.
This wasn't helpful.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to make fun, the effect was completely different, because he, like his father, was missing the convincing charm in which jokes could be governed by cruelty.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his light eyes.
Ailin's Solomons were reddening and rising from his steel chair and pouring the receiver at the same time and pouring the wine they had just drank.
The wine was made only from the backsucks, so he could not use it as a cause of a collision.
In her nervousness, she seemed to be shaking like palm tree leaves in the storm.
“And your thick head is the one that irritates me in you,” he said.
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Alinn, both for his own cruel words, and for the fear he saw in his eyes when he decided to stand against him.
Did Alilin think she'd hit him?
He had never told Kevern of his life in a great northern island where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it had basically been the same as life here.
The same huge, giant sea that waved against them.
The same clumsy men, though even more pale and diabolical than their smugglers, walked from pub to pub, ready to beat every woman who would dare to resist or mock them.
Fat head?
He'd still see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
First, suck – the kiss had become the most common word to describe the erotic encounter of a man and woman; the counter counter counter-unimportant loveballads – first suck and then attack.
Kevern said it was too much, because it was already hostile.
I think Solomons' body language told him to leave.
He pulled himself up from a steel chair like an old man.
He also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern's sorrow surprised him.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
Ilin followed him, just as his travel partner looked at Kevern's going upstairs from the window, a man who was himself responsible for his heavy life.
Adam's leaving the garden, he was thinking.
He felt pity for Kevern and men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to attack him.
A man who had turned his face, a gloomy, a disgraceful man, who had lost all his passion for battle – why did he feel that the vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he would have seen it once before this moment?
When Alilinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the recent incident, intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private institution measuring the general mind in Ofnow, made a short study of the continuation of minor and medium-sized violence in the areas of the country in which the violence was reduced, or, at the same time, the end, was most likely, taking into account the money and energy used for its torture.
“A lot has already been accomplished, and much has yet to be done, he wrote, ‘which can be offset for thousands of years by his struggle and most often by the natural aggressiveness of the conquered people, especially in those abandoned and remote caves, where, despite the church towers across the bushes, human amplitude is rarely known in the time.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower its desires.
The people cry on the censorial ballads, the stories about the anointed confrontations, and swears to the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time old-fashioned cruelty keeps an unsatisfied grip between rural communities and urban cooperatives, and there is also evidence of a new, more malicious dispute in homes, workplaces, streets and even playgrounds.
“You have to regret the tendency to dramatize, his director will comment after reading the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped his eyes on the ground.
I have to ask myself, are you an atheist?
\"I don't have to answer that,\" Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to appeal to his right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
“I don’t ask, Luther Rabinowitz said, “Because I am opposed to atheism, lesbianity and feminism.
There are no prejudices at this workplace.
We are servants of an unconditional society.
Although a certain kind of hypersensitivity is acceptable and respectful in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as what you have just presented to me.
You obviously have something against the church – and what you call cruelty or maliciousness, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
As if it had happened yesterday, if it happened above all, it would destroy the country’s fundamental vital vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around when he spoke to Rabinowitz.
Behind the head of Rabinowitz, the flamingonvale-red LED light declared the guidance that Ofnow had shared with the country in the last quarter or further of the previous century.
Smile with your neighbor, value your partner, listen to the ballads, visit the musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence and singing is better than written, but nothing wins love.
\"I understand well what you want to say,\" Esme Nussbaum replied in a silent voice when he was sure that his director had stopped, and I just want to say that we are not as effective as we think we are.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that initially led to SITHEN, WHAT TO DO.
This time, however, we will not shed our anger and distrust in others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
\"You go too far,\" he said, \"in your description of 'mistakes', the actions that our grandparents may have done or have not done.
You also go too far when you say that they poured out their “feelings and distrusts.”
Such a position like you should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about 'we' or 'they'.
There was no \"we\" or \"other\".
It was chaos time, that's all we know about it.
“If we are perfectly honest, in that chaos, Esme dared to continue, no group of society can say that they behave well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was good or bad.
That's when it was.
We don’t need to talk more about it – we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to share accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are reasonable or not, and even if there is a way to do them.
But for what reason the past exists then, if it is not learned from it --
There is a past so we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
\"I'm going through your report,\" he said, and said, \"It was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day he was going to work as normal as he was hit by a motorcycling on the sidewalk, described by the passers of driving as a bad-souling and rage-
Accidents happen.
Lesotho's army prohibits the attack; the Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Lesotho's military officials have banned the attack on the government's hacking and said they were working against a police suspect who was trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and invaded the government buildings in the capital city of Masero.
The head of state traveled with his family to the neighbouring country after he told South Africa that he had been killed.
The military representative, Ntle Ntoi, denied the attack and said that the army responded to such a threat that originated from “political fanatics” – the police said they tried to arm fanatics.
“Lesotho’s defense forces took action after receiving a number of intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they were ready to cause problems,” he told the Voice of America news agency.
According to President Clayson Mosela, the actions of the army seemed to be a revolution.
“Although no party has claimed to have repealed the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces seem to be a sign of a similar revolution, he says.
According to Lesotho's army officials, soldiers return to their chambers on Sunday, and the capital had a calm atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing leads the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes that action is targeted because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the differences between the government of the Great Coalition.
He denies the power of the government, although it is argued otherwise.
Business page: Microsoft to set up a data center for New Zealand
Microsoft has set up a large data center for a location that the company does not agree to specify.
In a statement sent to Microsoft media, the company notes that it does not explain the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars for Microsoft.
In the public, the centre had previously been put in place by Oulu or Kajani.
Microsoft will complete its office in Oulu, which will take about 500 people to work.
In all, Microsoft has announced that it will terminate up to 1 050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft Communications Manager Camilla Lindfors tells STT that the company does not comment on how much staff the new data center employs.
The establishment of a data centre to the New Zealand was announced on Monday by the Chamber of Commerce.
A man is accused of running a girl in traffic lighting

Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several different device options to choose from.
The cheapest option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both cost about $300.
I myself took these pictures at the family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than 350 dollars.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that you should follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera’s battery and other parts are closed in a waterproof manner.
In addition, set the camera's description settings to match the images or video taken.
Some cameras or combination of camera and video camera have a setting to optimise the imaging conditions under water.
In addition, before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can be taken.
Some cameras last only 5 feet in depth, others up to 50-60 feet in depth.
Take a look at our regular and watery models in our shopping guide and reviews of the digital cameras.
Take several pictures – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to connect the image, while the action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see it under the water, and making a picture can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera allows additional grip, which means taking several images at a time by different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface in the swimming pool, lake or sea.
Thus you will also get more colors in your images; the deeper you go, the less the colors you see.
Try to get close to a pictured target.
This is an important advice when describing the country, but even more important under the water, because the light conditions are limited.
It is very important when you have an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide image angle, i.e. the photographer must be close to the target to meet the entire frame of the image.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – protesters swear to revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters would not be allowed to elect candidates for the 2017 elections despite the lack of peace requiring a growing democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a spark to the long-awaited protesters of Hong Kong’s business world after the start of the plan and implement demonstrations only hours after the decision has been published.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress to give the Communists the power to eliminate all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
“This was expected, but it’s still frustrating,” says President of the Democratic Party, legislature Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They have lied to Hong Kong.
It is clear that we are acting with a sovereign government.
Mr Li Fei, Vice-President of the Committee of the People's Congress of China, defended the Chinese administration, saying that the general candidate for the decision of the Hong Kong leader would be too chaotic.
Since 1997, the UK has given Hong Kong China a promise to the residents of the region that it should choose its own leader since 2017.
According to the Chinese leaders, the Sunday’s decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the appointing committee, which is managed by Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who love the country and love Hong Kong are accepted.
In the summer preceding the decision, some of the largest and most attentive protests in the region were held in Hong Kong.
The campaign to defend democracy was largely behind the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, which the organizers have threatened to prevent the operation of the business world block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong real public voting rights.
On Sunday night, only hours after the publication of the decision, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in front of Hong Kong’s main government buildings.
In the demonstration, the organisers of the movement announced that the movement would move to a new era of civil disobedience and that they would be able to bring about Protestants in the coming weeks.
However, they did not tell the details apparently, fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
When publishing the network, the organisers said that the movement - considered Occupy Central as a last resort, which will only be introduced if there is no hope for dialogue and there is no other way -
We are very sorry to announce that today’s last opportunity for dialogue has been scratched and the taking of the centre will be taking place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were close to the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, restlessness feeds many people the feeling that the inhabitants are slowly losing their power in their city.
The wave from the mainland has caused competition for products and services.
In addition, there is fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under the increasing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten Hong Kong’s living conditions – a business world.
“The protest they are talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it lasts,” says the legislator Regina Ip, who has long appreciated the movement.
We do not want to worry about Hong Kong falling out of our grip.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
There are also stories in the Chinese media that Hong Kong’s democratic activists are the palms of the Western powers that are falling out of the revolution.
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights involving 780 000 people – over one fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the region's biggest demonstrations for democracy.
United States’ prom heritage strikes UK universities: new students with private jets
We are excited about our demand by setting up the first luxury travel form of Britain for today’s students.
The company also offers other vehicles such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 so that the customer can ensure the most memorable arrival of the university.
According to Stewart, the service also has a safety aspect.
The service is the best option for students who otherwise would drag their property across the country, after all, in loaded cars.
When it is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer students today the easiest and high-quality transportation to the university.
According to the company’s representative, reservations have not yet been made because the service has only been established, but added that “the students will begin the order during the next few weeks”
The company believes that there is demand for the service, although most students pay 9,000 pounds per year.
Today’s students are very different from their expectations and wishes as they started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Organization criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to Senior Vice President Megan Dunn, this service plan seems to be really far away from the life of the student majority.
Many in this month’s study begin to shock the level of living costs when the financial support offered in the form of loans and grants has remained behind the huge increase in the basic cost of living.

Bulgarian prison staff holds a national protest
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria expressed their views on the capital of Sofia in front of the Ministry of Justice.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted to return to the old rules of work that had been changed recently.
It is also necessary to discuss wage increases with the interim Minister of Justice Mr. Ivanov.
For a month, prison officials have been sympathizing against new working hours, saying they want to return to the old 24-hour working system.
Despite the meeting of the representatives of the prison workers’ organisation and the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) says.
Negotiations are currently under way, and the director of the Directorate-General for the Enforcement of Judgments, Rosen Zhézazkov, told BNR.
The protest of the prison workers’ organization is also expected to be linked to the members of the Trade Union of the workers of the Ministry of the Interior.
Basketball: Fans with almost too much to wear: Sasu Salin had to faint into the field
The basketball Sasu Salin was today the physicalization of Finland’s victory.
He was able to forget the symmetry of his U.S. match and set the blood of the second half of Ukraine on his stand-alone solutions.
But Salin moved all the glory to the wolves and did it in style:
I was going to roll out to that field at the end of the day, it was so great.
In my eyes, but in my eyes, there was nothing.
It was almost too much for me.
Salin’s power times included nine surfaces in a fast pace, ball bearings, plates, and camels everywhere.
I don't know how that happened, but I got into a flow mode like that that.
They come from somewhere, now to an incredibly important place, Sasu shone.
That's my role.
Do all that.
Now it was great to see that everyone else got caught up in the plot.
It's stuck in the whole gang.
Salin is a team’s joyful pill and spirit class, so it’s no wonder that his example brought the whole team to the flight that was too big and hard-bodied for the five of Ukraine.
In the UK World Championships after 32 years of break: I remember a rough trial game in the past.
Heikki Montonen was the head coach of Finland in Argentina’s World Cup in 1982.
It has been 32 years since the team of the Finnish men’s volleyball team played last time in the World Cup.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, with the legendary Reino Kosonen as Finland’s second coach and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as yesterday: it was in the early part a hot match against France.
“In this game, the judge game was dirty, remembers Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled on the back line.
Suddenly, the game was continued.
We lost it two to three, and then the assholes got a lot more confused,\" Parkkali said.
Finland played in the command of Heikki Montose and finally settled on 17th.
Now Finland is again among the world’s electives, when the Polish World Championship is on Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in international volleyball over 32 years.
The players’ strength values are roughly the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The players have also grown in average length.
The game is even faster, thinking about Parkkali.
But what happens in Poland?
The Finnish player’s material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to continue from the beginning.
Then you can get tight, Kosonen.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a defeat in a victory match against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Championship.
Let's hope we're in 17th place now.
South Korea and Tunisia should go wrong,\" Parkkali said.
Reino Kosonen was a national coach in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen, and Kari Körkkö were in Tunisia.
The sauna and evening charter at Buenos Aires Marine Church were part of the country team’s program in the World Championship in 1982.
Kari Kalin (i.e.) stretched with his teammates.

Finnish tourists rescued from the mountain of Cita in Norway: “These men deserve all thanks.
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs were in trouble on Thursday on the mountains, Antti and Tuomo Soini offered a great deal of help.
This weekend, Mikkelsen is looking for international heroes on Facebook to thank his assistants once more.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that a Cita dog who was with him on Thursday in the mountains hurt his face.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk on a steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried to attract and pull it a little further, but its feet didn’t just carry, Mikkelsen wrote in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no help from the police, the nearby hotel, or the passerstlers.
In the dark of the evening, the situation began to seem threatening.
Fortunately, there were two travelers who were willing to help: the Tamperean Antti Soini and his father's Judge.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway at Galdhøpiggen and headed to their campground when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells East Sanom in his message.
Soon, a German man who had a hike with him also happened.
Cita was given to a couple of people who were injured by the dog.
The German man arrived for a moment after we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the chest for a while, Soini says.
KUVA: Judge Soini
The dog was brought down with the help of the hiker.
According to food, the performance was not physically heavy, but it was slow to carry in a difficult terrain.
In about one and a half hours, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen was still looking for international heroes on Facebook so that he could thank them again.
The calls answered him on Sunday, but the German man is still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen will rejoice.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have returned.
I want to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and honor, I am forever grateful to them.
On Monday night, the Soinis were already on their way home.
They had been glad to hear from Mikkelsen: \"Cita can be better!\"

Genetic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed
A British woman was afraid of dying for years because of a false diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth had only a few years to live because he had a diagnosis of another disease.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It means a series of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, false diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, as they are known to be so little.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people in the United Kingdom suffer from CMT disease, which causes symptoms of motorism, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking, and pain in the toes.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he was suffering from Friedreich’s ataxia (FA), which has a very bad survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and died before he reached 30 years of age.
Today, the mother of a 51-year-old child says that as a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as others.
I fell every day, and I lasted longer than anyone else.
I could never skate or skate with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran in a different way than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he was undergoing a series of surgery to perform foot surgery. In the event of surgery, he quickly looked at his research papers, which said he was suffering from the FA disease.
“I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I came home, I had accurate information about the disease in the library, and I wrote to the FA association,” he said.
When I got information from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I was going to be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I turned 25, and in between I would lose all my ability to act quietly.
I went through this to myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by 17 years old, he said that his walk had not been paralyzed as much as he thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor was just hugging me, saying, \"She's a girl, honey, I don't think you have this illness, because otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair.
I think you're suffering from a much less dangerous disease.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT disease.
“When I was explained what the CMT disease was, I thought I had been postponed,” he said.
Charity CMT UK organizes a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
A hundred migrants were found in a coal wagon in Macedonia

The municipality showed a fair sportsman and was unanimous in his decision.

The Electoral Association Hull invested the club’s record amount in the acquisition of Abel Hernandez, a member of the Uruguayn National Team.
Hernandez replaces Hull's Italian club from Palermo with a £9.5 million pound, or around €12 million.
The contract is three years old.

Russian space test failed - the gogs sent to sex travel died
The five small gusts sent to the Russian space are dead, according to Roscosmos, the Russian Federation.
Gekot traveled to the Foto-M4 satellite for more than one and a half months.
The satellite returned to Finland on Monday morning.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of the genes in a weightless state.
One male and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds special, it was meant to be serious.
For example, little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of gecko eggs.
The impact on the Gecks can help to predict the impact of unimportantity on the human being in a longer-term state, the New Statesman observed in July.
Roscosmos says the time of death and cause of death or death of the genes is determined.
According to Interfax, cross-border passengers were frozen.
Surprisingly, it is also said that the fruit flies traveling along the same Photon-M4 rides survived the journey and also received post-growing.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice Airport
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice Airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected to be a recruiter of a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities announced this on Sunday.
The authorities got to the man's track after he had attracted a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl’s explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl’s father, who was completely ignorant of the daughter’s intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, he is home to Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had already followed the man’s actions.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that radicalised young people attracted to Iraq or the Syrian War constitute a safety risk to France as well.
The authorities estimate that about 800 French citizens or people in France have traveled to Syria during the last conflict, returned there or are currently planning to leave Syria.
Copy: We have a good chance to win
The wishes of the basketball team for the sequel are in play when Finland meets today in the second match of World Cups in Ukraine.
If the opening plan for the United States had been expected, Ukraine will be part of those countries where Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance to win, Petteri Koponen anticipates.
On Saturday, Ukraine won the first race in the Dominican Republic from 72 to 62.
The team will train the NBA veteran Mike Fratello, whose command Ukraine will play aggressive basketball.
Ukraine’s key player is Eugene-Pooh – Jeter, a world champion of hundreds of meters, whose sister Carmen Jeter is a world champion three years ago.
The Dominican Republic against Jeter threw 16 points.
Pooh Jeter is a fast guy, but we have been played against such things before, and we have to get our standard defense right,\" Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than in its loss last night to the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can assure you that there is a normal wolf on the field, Möttölä said.
The alleged infects of Hollywood stars spread on the internet - some confirmed to be real
There are a number of nudity images on the internet, which are said to be presented by well-known people of publicity.
Among other things, actress Jennifer Lawrence has become a victim of an incapacitating campaign.
The entertainment siteTMZ has published an angry comment by Lawrence’s representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of images.
This is a gross breach of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (in the Internet) the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, representatives threaten.
According to TMZ, actor Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images that spread him are real.
He had taken these photos years ago with his husband.
When I know that these pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what terrible trouble was seen for this purpose.
I feel compassion for everyone who had become a victim of hacking, he wrote on the site.
Instead, the actor Victoria Justice calls the pictures of his own name counterfeited.
Real or fake images are also available from at least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
Honka’s painter criticized his own: “They didn’t work enough to get out of here.
The football club FC Honka is currently in the final position of the Veikkausliga.
The comments made by Master Walter Viitalan after the Sunday VPS match describe the current state of the club.
I haven't had a goalkeeper for four months.
But everything needs to be adapted, the fifth said after a 1-2-loss struggle.
In the first half, Honka made a lot of defense-head mistakes.
The painting officer Vitala was not in the mind of a bad defense.
Player traffic in Hong Kong has been lively this summer, and for that reason, the defenders in front of Viitala have changed at a close pace.
As a result, many young players have been given opportunities that they may not even deserve.
“Osa doesn’t work enough to get out of here sometimes, but Vithala did nothing to name any single player.
Honga’s head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed to some extent with Viitalan.
“After the game, I told certain players that if you’re in training and games to have fun and think you’re a bet player, and you don’t have to work, you’re probably in the wrong team,” Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don’t want to take that place and use the opportunity, it’s not my fault.
However, Kuqi also recalled that players can’t expect immediate success when players are constantly changing.
This period has not been the same two times in a row.
Especially on the head of defense, the crowd has changed.
That's the biggest reason we're in this place,\" Kuqi said.
Honka is a serial god after the VPS loss, with the second TPS.
There are seven more rounds left, so the Espoolians still have time to avoid falling into the One.
I've never hit a team, and I'm not going to hit it now.
We're not really going to fall for this show, the goalkeeper Vitala threatened.

Ice Bucket
Britti Isabelle Roberts screamed so hard when they poured ice-cold water on him that he damaged the skeleton of his face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended badly.
The woman has been taken to the treatment after she yelled at the Ice Bucket challenge when she performed so hard that her jaw went off.
Mr Roberts shouted so hard when he was poured ice-cold water on him that he damaged the structure of his face.
“The water was so cold that I just screamed, but when I screamed, I felt that my jaw started to stiffen,” he told The Mirror.
The ice is poured on a 20-year-old.
A moment before the accident.
I tried to close my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister found out the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to be praised for first aid.
The 20-year-old British was taken to a hospital where the jaw was put back in place.
The video game has become an Internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
How can the increase in the number of fans be explained?
Today was a great one.
This is what the basketball player Sakari Pehkone said in 1995, when Finland had played in the EM final tournament against France in the Athenian Marouss Balloon Hall.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I remember the game when he was there.
So were about one hundred Finns who shouted at 20,000 viewers to pull, otherwise the noise of an empty hall.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the World Cup in Finland-Ukraine?
In Bilbao, hundreds of Finnish fans are eighty times.
The EM contests 1995 were a Finnish basketball hunt.
The men cut their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian Championship at the Helsinki Sports House.
The victory opened the doors to Europe.
Everything seemed good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Möttöl.
The main coach Henrik Dettmann brought Mötkölä to the final tournament team with a calcino tips.
A solution that many disagree with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was far wise, even though not all went according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
In Athens, Finns were known to be there a little over a hundred.
This included suppliers, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and some fans.
There are also journalists, relatives and trainers in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unobservable proportions.
I'm sure no one can tell you the exact number of Finnish skiers.
The estimates have moved between 7,500 and 10,000.
There was a number between there and there, it's a total number of things that I don't understand.
Here's to explain to the sports clubs.
In the global economy, businesses move across borders.
In sport, we still have the opportunity to look at how we are going internationally.
As mobility increases, we can see how our girls and our sons succeed in the world, says Professor Hannu Ikkonen of Sports Level Sociology.
In both Spain and the World Cup, there are Finns who apply for life.
Joint experience.
But it doesn't explain everything.
There must also be attraction in sports itself.
Ikkonen raises sport as part of the popular culture.
It’s a lower threshold to go to sports competitions than Berlin to watch art.
Without success, the masses will not be able to move.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time, coach Dettmann challenged the basketball association and also the players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed, and the country's operations were lifted to the foot.
The balloons made the same move a little earlier.
Now they both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Ikkonen says, both species have succeeded in producing their top sports, where the sacred trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
The public is also interested in it.
And the media has taught me what such a carnival support is, Ikkonen reminds me.
Can balling species transfer this massive interest to home series?
On average, basketball and volleyball play for hundreds or a little over a thousand viewers.
The question is a good question, and it is not necessarily an answer that would promise very good species.
Another school believes interest is moving.
The other is the one who doesn’t want a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for a live trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, the series in the country are not of dual interest.
There's a challenge for the followers in the middle of the humming.
For Bottaks' plots - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake's beach
Nastola is rewarded by a formula driver at Valtteri Botttaksun Beach Cottage.
The municipality government unanimously approved the transfer of 1.4 hectares of land at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, there will be a free-time apartment.
In Nastola, Bottaks has been following the success of this map.
He is a good ambassador to market Lahta, Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It has become owned by the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate trade.
There are seven buildings in the area, of which six will be removed at the expense by the end of this year.
Bottas won his fourth prize in the Belgian competition this year.
He's at the World Cup on the fifth.
Bottas is a native Nastolian and has lived with his childhood at Vil source.
He now lives in England, but always goes to Nastola when there are free formulas.
Bottas has visited high school and youth facilities.
Design smarts come in, but hardly for the poor.
It will present and test them at the U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirt testers are field ballers, but also amateur Marcus Giron, one of the tops of the university players.
According to him, the shirt helps him to follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
The nylon shirt is woven with silver sensors, where the information is transmitted to the cage in the shirt and still to the smartphone or tablet computer.
The sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress, and steps.
Before throwing the shirt into the washing machine, the battery is removed from the centre unit.
The fashion house has not told you exactly the time to start selling the shirt, nor have you even tipped it off, Tech Times news.
Raph Lauren is not the only company to invest in smart clothes.
California's Athos has brought smart shirts and smart strokes to sale.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost a hundred dollars a piece, and the central unit of the thumb that they require will cost two hundred dollars.
He also wrote Red Orbit about technovats.
A smart way to save your textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so soon Matt Schroeder, starting his second year of study, invented a smart way to save cost.
He developed a system in which students of later years borrowed their books against nominal compensation instead of selling the books at the same time.
“My book of mathematics would normally have cost 180 dollars; I paid for it throughout the academic period for $10, and I was feeling like a sandwich,” says Schroeder, 19 years old, who is studying at the Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says that his last semester book would normally have paid $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the University’s Management Board, the average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many means to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly faced with creative approaches such as online shops and Schroeder’s idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay for it clearly less than students who buy the book.
According to the Neebo Inc company that holds more than 250 campus books, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
The statistics on the field reveal that about a quarter of the books of university bookstores in the past spring were rental books, according to Trevor Meyer, the chairman of the Neebo company.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus books stores.
The simplest ways to save money.
Online Stores
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained by a third of the price it would pay for a campus in the bookstore.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's 9th edition's recommended price is almost $290, but from the online store of specialized books, Chegg.com's book will cost $239.99.
Buy as used
The books used are a good option if the reader does not interfere with other notes and worn appearances.
For example, the “Calculus” book can be used for Chegg.com’s online store with $93.49.
The last year student at Brigham Young University, Matt Casaday, for 25 years, tells us that he bought the book “Strategic Media Publications: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business – used by Amazon.com for only $4.22.
The new book would have cost 48 dollars.
The director of the University of Massachusetts's College Without Walls School, Ingrid Bracey, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes new weight reforms are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old weight can only be found in a fraction of the price that should be paid for a new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
You should consider renting your textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after your course.
By renting you can save more than 80% of the price of the new book.
For example, renting the book Callculus for the entire semester costs about $20.
Find out about the rules of the rental company, such as notes, use of interest rate and consumption for the following payments.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the delay fee may be higher than the book purchase price.
E-books
Buying e-books instead of ordinary papers can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are leased to pay the right to use the e-book to its owner, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg will receive a letter from Calculus for about $61 a month.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most because many classics today can be downloaded for free, while science and technology books can be very expensive.
Comparing different vendors is worth what option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29 who will soon start Pepperdine in law science, recommends using the book ISBN number in order to find a price, as it will help to ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before you order from the network, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned this through the heel.
The delivery of the book he purchased was in the ice for four weeks, and he eventually had to get the book at the full price of the university’s bookstore.
Tampere Legion Theatre is 20 years old

In fires, nearly double the number of people died last year compared to
In the fires this year, nearly two times the number of people died compared to last year.
According to the media monitoring of the Finnish Rescue Agency (Spek), 55 people have already died in the fires in 49 different fires.
Last year there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65 years of age.
According to the organization's fire-death statistics, the worst situation was last in 2009, when 64 people were killed in fires by the end of August.
Most of the fire deaths occur in the apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in the estates, 21 in the private homes, and seven in row houses and other small houses.
Spok reminds me of repeating home fire safety.
At least the functionality of all fire extinguishers in the home should be ensured by Speck.
In addition, everyone should check that the primary decommissioning equipment is easily accessible.
There must also be an accessible exit route from all the premises of the home.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they are allowed to use when they are at home alone.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO Summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in Newport City Center in the anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people met at Cardiff City Hall for the so-called counter-departure meeting.
Stephen Fairclough followed events during the weekend and spoke with protesters who had arrived even from Belgium.
The young people were rescued by air from the Blue Mountains of Australia
Two teens were brought to safety after they were stuck at night in the Blue Mountains in the New South Wales area of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went out to go to Blackhead on Sunday.
They were worried about young people who had not returned home and called the police at night two.
A search party consisting of local police and assistants was sent to find young people, and the two were found around 23 o’clock near the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and hit her head.
The police spent the night with a couple, and they were taken to safety on Monday morning.
The carers were taken to Blue Mountains with an ambulance, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk Airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk Airport.
According to the Ukrainian Army, soldiers were ordered to retreat.
According to Ukraine, the parasols have taken a great deal of effort with Russian tanks on the field.
According to the military representative, the counter-gun fire has been so accurate that the shooter is likely to have Russian professional soldiers.
During the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the Southeastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian patrol ship was sunk yesterday, says the Border Guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The Border Guard did not have any certainty about where the ship was shot.
The Separatists told me yesterday that they shot the platform in social media.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov demanded that the Ukrainian troops immediately withdraw to positions that they cannot fire civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, during the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE, an immediate ceasefire should be reached without conditions.
Lavrov also recalled that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions on the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
The heavy rains got Malmö and Copenhagen flooding.
The streets flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen, when the hardships whipped South Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters cut off several roads, mixed traffic and buried cars in their pool.
On Sunday, the authorities estimate that the flood may last, although the rains were predicted to cease on Monday.
The heavy rains were surprised by the Swedish authorities, and the rains were not given in advance of weather forecasting.
According to Ari Mustala, the Finnish Meteorological Institute’s best-selling meteorologist, that the area was very local.
The rainy area looks narrow and permanent.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
The French socialists should be silent and helping France – Francois Holland’s main aids say
Valls urged a deeply divided left to show his feelings – a socialist president in difficulty, whose composition of the new government did not receive the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves all respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
“Our job is to stay close to him,” Valls said.
As a satisfying gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave a new economic minister Emmanuel Macron, despite the 35-hour working week in France, despite the debate on the proposal that the rule should be suspended.
On Saturday, the Netherlands asked the socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, caused the dispute by appearing at a meeting of socialists who expressed differing opinions and criticising the Socialist Party for allowing “France to give up hope for the future.”
Marine Le Pen, the head of the National Front of the Estonian Republic, mocked the constant mutual dispute between the socialists and said that he did not believe the new government of Valls will last a few months longer.
Francois Hollande may have gone to the war, but so did Manuel Valls, who was obligated to form a new government after the previous one didn’t even last the summer.
“No new government will last until autumn or winter,” Le Pen told reporters.
He reiterated his party's proposal to break down the parliament and held his party's electoral victory in the early elections, and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing loss in the municipalities of March, and the extreme right was held in the EU elections in May.
According to the opinion of the Journal du Dimanche published on Sunday, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break down into several competing groups before the end of the Dutch period in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political researcher at the University of Poscal, warned that the French will soon lose their patience, unless the new socialist government manages to improve the economy and record unemployment.
“There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly note that the change is happening,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation can get worse.
Pukka cheated on the mornings of Finnish runners Kirsi Alm-Sira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda in a badly recorded section of the program.
Last Thursday, the program released a fun video of Thursday’s recordings on its Facebook page.
With the video, Kirsi Alm-Sira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record a morning of Finnish ad pub from the next day, but the recording does not go completely into the pipeline.
Alm-Sira is confusing in her words when she tries to say a word about budget disputes, and her confusion also makes Pouda and Rahkola lose their boys once and for all.
And these heroes should be allowed to take a direct broadcast tomorrow, and this morning’s Facebook update says.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, who worked in the journal photo office, was ranked the third in the series of pottery in 1972.
The picture is Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
At Fredrikinkatu in Helsinki, a meeting of the Socialist International Assembly was held in the House of Building Masters in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting, and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went along.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had a lot of five minutes to describe.
I took this picture in five metres.
The light and the background were right.
I just realized that this time I did.
The look of the Meir is that the leaders of the Middle East have been difficult before.
In the competition, the people or events were successful with the images taken.
It is great that you can also succeed in other images today, as long as you have an idea and visual torque.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's crash picture of the Munich Olympics.
That's not what I sent to the competition.
Statement: Aarnio study has already paid more than EUR 5 million
The investigation of the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Department has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 years of work.
This is how Jyri Rajamäki assesses thesis of information technology by Jyväskylä University.
The Rajamäki proposes that monitoring the legality of police activities and the fight against crime could be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigation and judicial treatment.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables the multi-use of criminal technology.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected to investigate the crime is automatically electronic evidence that meets the evidence chain and at the same time enables comprehensive law enforcement.
The statement will be checked on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: \"Food and chicken food included in casvisdiet
The photo of the special information on the wall of the school of the Pirkkalainen Women's Travel caused food in the social media, says Yle on its website.
Vegetarians!
Fish and chicken dishes included in school lunch.
Only when there is meat on the list will we make a vegetable alternative!
This is the case in a 15-year-old announcement that has forgotten the school's wall.
You can see the picture here.
The picture spread in social media has led people to send angry feedback to Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Head of the Food and Cleaning Service, says to Yle that the missing ceiling is not correct and should have been removed a while ago.
Apparently, before I came, there has been an idea that has been discussed with healthcare in the past.
Every student receives a meal according to their wishes, he says to Yle.
Today at Pirkala Schools, students are offered a vegetarian diet only with parental permission and a certificate from a doctor or nurse about a vegetarian meal.
The risk is justified by the fact that young vegetarian drinks may leave the nutrition shortage and the absence of meat or chicken can cause a surprise to students’ parents.
Norwegian Cruise with a $3 billion Prestige Cruise Agreement
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, is negotiating to buy its competitors Prestige Cruises International Inc for $3 billion. The information comes from those who are closely involved in the matter.
With the transaction, Norwegian Cruise Company, with a market value of $6.8 billion, would be made available by Prestige Cruises luxury rivetists and wealthy customers as they continue to compete against larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to the sources, information on a possible agreement may be published this week, although it is also possible that negotiations will not result.
Prestige Cruises’ owner, a private venture company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be made public because the negotiations were not public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruises and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments and Apollo's representative refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company from Miami has 13 cruise ships covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Middle America and the Caribbean.
Its net sales grew by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, with net sales of $2,57 billion.
The Prestige Cruises, which operates so far from Miami, is a adventure with the O Guinea and Regent brand names, which include a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was 1.2 billion dollars, which is 6 per cent more than in the previous year.
The cruise industry worth $29 billion is expected to benefit from the rise of emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
Companies compete to become the first option for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registers the first issue of shares on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company’s shares since 2007, with a value of $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 with its combined Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. The latter is a Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay entertainment and casino company.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the published data, Genting’s share of the company was 28 per cent, Apollo 20 per cent, and TPG Capital LP’s share of the private equity company was 8 per cent from the end of June.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise companies in North America’s cruise capacity is 82%, according to the registration document published during the launch of the Prestige Cruise Company’s shares.
The City Government of Tampere is working on it today.
Animalia hopes that the city government will have strong support for the initiative.
According to Salla Tuimavaara, the Executive Director of Animalia, who prepares the dissertation at the University of Tampere, during the dolphins in Finland and around the world, it is necessary to end quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, it has become a common view that the presence of mammals such as dolphins in dolphins is not animal-protection and ethically sustainable.
This would also be the view of Tampere.
The abolition of the dolphin is not only a matter of animal law, but also a question of Tampere’s image as a tourist destination, the Judge points out.
According to the judge, the death of the Näsi dolphin confirms the requirements for the downside of the dolphin activity.
I see death as a sad sequel to the dark history of the dolphin of Särkänniemi.
It’s time to put a point on the dead, close the dolphin prison, and start to figure out how to transfer the Tampere dolphins to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, the Judge calls for.
You could not see a return to the original environment of dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Pärkänniemi were able to experience more life than their unrivaled concrete, the Judge’s hope.
Animalia’s aim is to ban the use of all wild species in circuses in the complete reform of the Animal Protection Act on the preparation of the preparation.
This includes dolphins.
In support of the requirement, the Executive Director of Animalia, Tumivaara, is taking part in the September 1st demonstration on behalf of dolphins.
The demonstration by the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will be carried out against the Delfinese hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, approximately 2,300 dolphins are being captured or brutally killed each year, either for the use of dolphins or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations with East Ukraine on a new state
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that the Ukrainian government would stop fighting the separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations on the different region of state, the Russian news sources will tell us.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the eastern Ukraine region of separatist would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be re-examined in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their rights and interests.
The request to the Government of Putin Kiev for negotiations with the Russian rebels as equal negotiating partners is responsible for his apparent strategy, which he has followed since the violence began five years ago: he seeks to help the separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to give the newly declared Novorossian independence, which could lead to Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 TV, Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian army to regain the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region ruled by separatists, which the separatists captured in March and April, following the accession of Moscow to the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently poured the region into Novorossija – a new Russia – – this term reminds us of the glorious days before the Great Revolutions of Russia.
According to the Russian news agency, Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace talks were a \"aircraft\" as long as Ukrainian politicians are making campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October and government forces attack civilians in the areas dominated by separatists.
“We must immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and on the status of the state of South-East Ukraine, which takes into account the interests of people living there,” he said.
According to Peskovi, Putin's reference to statehood is linked to wider independence, which has been discussed with the Kiev leadership for months in trying to eliminate the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant to eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
There can be no debate on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says: “As it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it is the internal conflict between Ukraine and Ukraine.
The interdependence of the Kremlin representative, which aimed at correcting Putin’s comments - stressed that the Russian government is dealing with the rebellion of separatists in the eastern regions in a different way than the Crimean, in which it, in practice, took over the region, which was ethnically Russians by a majority of the population of 2 million people.
Moscow would be far more difficult to integrate even the areas of Donetsk or Luhansk in Eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people in the region are not ethnically Russian and, according to pre-conflict reviews, the majority of the population supported Ukraine’s survival.
Independence, from which Russian diplomats have been discussed with international forums, would give the Ukrainian local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin practically power in the territory that unites the Russian Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was incorporated into Russia five months ago, is located in the Russian main fleet and in the port areas and historical coastal areas of commercial shipping.
In the region between Rostov and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and metal slabs that produce vital products to the Russian army.
On 7 June, President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, consider constitutional changes to increase the decision-making power of regions outside the core area of Ukraine on their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from the view of the separatists, which might be armed by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin's most recent requirement for the Kiev Government to negotiate with the Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels advanced more last week after the Russian tanks and troops entered the former peace zone on the Azov Sea coast.
The Ukrainian security authorities are afraid that the taking over of the city of Novozavsk by the separatists supported by Russia will be the beginning of a greater effort to take over the entire strategic coastal area to Crimea.
It has led to a massive strengthening of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military staff. Mariupol, a half million inhabitants, is known as a port city producing steel, located between Novoazovski and Crimean peninsula, in a narrow country leading to Novoazovsky and Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels, asking for additional measures to prevent Russia’s future violations in Ukraine, the former Republic of the Soviet Union, which has been independent for 23 years.
“We will soon arrive at a point where there is no return,\" Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders presented additional sanctions to enable them to be introduced if the Ukrainian crisis is re-examined under unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw their position in the region of Ilovakis, after the transfer of two Russian armored departments and 1,000 soldiers to the Donetsk area last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council representative, reported to journalists on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenkko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers in the Russian Ilovakis island was replaced by 10 Russian parasols captured in the Ukrainian region a week ago.
Milan's opening painting was made by a Japanese actress Kesuke Honda on the seventh game.
In the second half, Sulley Muntar first hit and a little later Jeremy Menez's punishment kick.
Laziok received a ranking at the end of the game, but the goalkeeper Diego Lopez resisted Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan this season from Real Madrid.
Milan’s former attacker icon at Inzagh’s coaching debytyt was only half of the San Siro Stadium.
39,000 viewers were declared to be the audience of the contest.
Australian publications and Gabi Grecko in the round of the nudity scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he has been grounded by hackers, perhaps stolen by his engagement and Hollywood A-list-star Gabi Grecco.
In the entertainment world, after a series of substations of Jennifer Lawrence were published on the internet as a result of a large-scale public-viewing scandal.
Hacker has been told to have a total of 60 nudity pictures of Hunger and other superstars, such as Kate Upton and Cara Delevinnes, singer Rihanta, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actor Kirsten Dunst.
Also, pictures of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko in Melbourne are apparently stolen during the iCloud leak.
The list has 101 celebrity names.
Mr. Grecko, last month's costumer, Edelsten, said to the Confidential magazine, which is disgusting.
All personal contact and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Greckon, in New York, reported the case in the web page and said that the victims felt ashamed.
Hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with this previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two of the samples from Palmer on the top-of-the-line pool edge.
Palmer’s films include film – Love and Honor – opponent Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck Series star Strahovski and Sugar Punch actor Browning did not comment on hacked images yesterday.
Lawrence’s representative said to the TMZ magazine that “there is a gross breach of privacy”
The actor Seth Rogen was angry with the hacker in his tweet: “The release of stolen images is no different from the sale of the stolen product.
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, from a legal point of view.
Finland played almost as in its homefield and rose to the sensational victory of Cuba in the volleyball World Championships.
Look at the pictures of the fan flute.
Polish Katowice was white on Monday: not Polish red-white, but Finnish blue-white.
According to the STT, Finland’s victory was followed by nearly 2,000 Finnish supporters.
I felt like I was playing at home.
So much impact the fans had on our game, the Finnish captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland was already in the game with the loss of the range 0-2, but rose to the win of the 3-2.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miracle rise behind six points.
Cuba led one to 16-10, but after that the Finns got a charm.
However, a few hundred Finnish fans were disappointed when the charter machine was not able to land due to the hard fog of Katowicee.
The fans that ended in Warsaw were late for the match.
The Finnish football fans have taken over Europe with a hard pace in recent days.
In the Spanish Bilbao basketball World Cup, more than 8,000 fans are present.
Just as if every Finnish basket had been the winner of the game, Stephen Curry, a US star player, called the Finnish basketball fans after Saturday's match.
The meeting of the Board of Directors shall not be sent directly due to technical problems.
Today, the City Council of Kouvola is unable to see it directly through the Internet.
According to the city announcement, the shipment is not possible due to technical problems.
The city of Kouvola regrets the situation.
You can look at the follow-up in a couple of days from the meeting.
The City Council of Kouvola has been able to watch over the Internet since the beginning of the year.
Next time, decision-making can be followed directly on 13.10.2014.
The meetings of the Board of Directors are available at http://www.kouvola.fi/index/adult in the U.S.A./patos.html and on the YouTube channel in Kouvola.
