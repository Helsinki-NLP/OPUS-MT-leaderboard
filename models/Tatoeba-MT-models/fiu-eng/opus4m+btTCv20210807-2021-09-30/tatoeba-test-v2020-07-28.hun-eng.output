Stop trying to fix me.
I'm shocked.
Is that going to affect me?
I always drink two cups of coffee in the morning.
I caught Tom at the elbow.
I don't know where Tom's umbrella is.
This is the last straw.
I ran all the way to the station this morning.
That was great.
Maybe I'll eat it later if I'm hungry.
Is there anything between you two?
Don't ask me why, just do it.
My dream is to be a teacher.
Very nice of you.
What time do you usually have breakfast?
Smell this flower.
There had to be a reason for this.
We are in our prayers.
Don't stay long.
Oh, no!
I'd rather go on a bike than walk.

He lives in another state.
I'm working to live, but I'm not living to work.
Be there right then.
He knows everything about cooking.

Can I make some suggestions?
Mary was looking for you then.
I found a place to live.
Where is Tom going to take pictures?
Get some Nazis.
None of us are cowards.
It's not a whole story.
What are these for?
His parents were outside the city.
And what can you show me for that?
How long has Thomas been working here?
This is grape wine.
He's speaking honestly.

What do you want to do in the future?
Tom's safe.
We understand the goal.
No one was there.
All my questions were answered.
I knew you were going to get in trouble.
Tomi has a guest.
I feel a sharp chest pain.
I'm willing to risk it.
How can you say that?
I don't want to sleep.
I don't believe a word of it.

We don't want anything from you.
You know where the problem comes from.
What are you looking at?
It's unlikely Tom knows where Mari lives.
Three ice creams, please.

We're out of coffee.
Let's take a walk.
What would you do if your child were like this?
My kids don't lie to me.
I'm not proud of my daughter.
It never ends.
They're both laughing.
I wish you wouldn't do that now.
I was trying to help Tom.
Your soul is in hell.
I'm a fever and my head hurts, and I think I'm gonna be sick.

He loves trains.
We're home today.
I saw Tom dancing with another girl.
No one was in the room.

I'm sorry, but I didn't fully understand what you said.
Last night, there was a fire near us.
We better go, Tom.
Probably you all need a little sleep.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't eat this.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets into trouble again.
I got on the plane.
Are you home?
Clouds take the mountain.
That's my problem.
How can I understand with you?
It's in the kitchen.
I should have done that to you.

What a mess!
How annoying!
Tom put the boxes on each other next to the wall.
It is known that the bear loves honey.
