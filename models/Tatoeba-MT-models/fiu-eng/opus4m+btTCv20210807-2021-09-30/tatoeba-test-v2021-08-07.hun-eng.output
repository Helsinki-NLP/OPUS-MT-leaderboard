I hung hands with Tom and went.
I've shaken my head.
I should go there.
I should have asked Tom first.
I should have asked Tom for help.
I should have been a movie star.
I should have been at the meeting.
I should have been there at the meeting.
I should have been more consolidated.
I should have been much more precise.
I should have been more thorough.
I should have been there soon.
I should have brought more food.
I should have come here first.
I should have done that last week.
I should have done this somewhere else.
I should have done that to you.
I should have helped Tom do that.
I should never have come to Boston.
I shouldn't have said anything.
I should have denied to do that.
I should have seen this coming.
I should have stayed out of it.
I should have tried something else.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I should've calculated this.
I should have followed your advice.
I should've said I wasn't ready.
I'm screaming, but nobody hears me.
I just want to know what this is about.

Is it too late?
Is it true that Tom committed suicide?
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
Is it true that in a week you learned Esperanto?
Is it true that you've come to see Tom's daughter?
Is it true you like salty coffee?
Is it time?
Is the fruit more affordable than coffee?
I'm skiing in winter, swimming in the summer.
Laurie's dick?
I sleep with two pillows.
After midnight, I slept an hour last night.
I fell asleep, too late for school.
I slept nine hours.
I thanked my boss.
I've got the turkey on.
Mary Tom's mother?
Cigarettes.
Is Monday going to be okay?
Am I clear?
I clicked a picture.
I sat in the house.
I ran into the house.
I've been tossing it.
Is it okay now?
Wasn't it enough for you to ruin my life?
Isn't it a stomach twister?
I sold it this afternoon.
Sometimes I'm sad.
Sometimes my stomach hurts.
I sleep sometimes.
Is it far away from Paris?
I'll talk a little Dutch.
I'll talk a bit in Hungarian.
I'm talking a little Hungarian.
I'm talking in Hungarian.
I'll talk a little Russian.
I'll talk Russian.
I'm talking Russian.
I speak French almost every day.
I speak French and English.
I'm speaking Spanish.
I've been with him all day.
I've been at them all day.
I spent all my money.
I spent all my money.
I spent all the money I had to buy the book.
I've been lurking for an hour until I figure out where to go.
I was incubator at the beginning of my life.
I was incubator at the beginning of my life.
I spent the afternoon with my friends.
I spent the whole day in front of my machine.
I've been sitting for three years for a crime I haven't committed.
I've been sitting for three years for something I didn't do.
I told you too early.
I need lemon jam on my bread.
The rainwater?
Is Russia part of Europe or Asia?
Is she so important?
Is that your mom?
Is it very close to Sicily Malta?
I've been staring at papers all day, and I'm tired.
I began to doubt his claim in the truth.
I stayed.
Tea is more expensive than milk?
Is he licensed?
Is that the whole thing?
Secret?
Is that right?
Is that purposeful?
Is that the one on the picture or is it photographed there?
Is that the one on the picture or the one on it?
Is that my cup?
Is this included in a public document?
Is that a problem for you?
Is that real money?
Do you have a scientific basis for this?
Did you count on that?
Is this so hard to understand?
Is that the problem?
Right?
But is that true?
Is that what everyone wants?
Is the cat on the chair or under it?
Is the beach clean?
Is the competition so bad?
Is the microphone turned on?
Is the museum open today?
Is there a doctor on board?
Is there a free place?
Do you have a subway in your city?

Is that the key you're looking for?
Is that valuable?
Is this home love for you?
Is that what you call home love?
Is that your girlfriend?
Is this your money?
I still don't remember anything.
I still can't tell you why.
That was seven or eight years ago, exactly where did you go?
I still don't understand anything.
I still don't know why you did it.
I still have a lot of time to have fun.
There's still one or two things to put in the suitcase.
I still have breakfast.
I still think this is the best choice.
Tom Christian?
Does Tom cook well?
Tom's a good cook?
Tom's a good teacher?
Is Tom alive?
“Tom American?” No, Canadian.
- I don't know, I'll call him and ask him.
Tom's dead?
Is Tom in?
Thomas left-handed?
Tom's lost?
Tom Mary's son?
Tom ready?
Thomas is still sick?
I was with him.
I came to you today, but you weren't home.
I stopped talking.
I learn about two hours every day.
I study hard at school.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I guess you've already packed up and ready to go.
I must have heard that sound somewhere.
I swear I'll compensate you for that.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half kilometers a day.
Does your daughter feel better?
Are you doing dangerous work?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom home?
There is no doubt.
It affects everyone.
It's not over until we're done with it.
I'll take your place.
I'm going to work on a train every day.
I talked to Tom a few times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
It could be better with your sister.
This goes with the love I feel for you.
It cost me a lot more than I expected.
The price is two euros.
It could be a problem.
It could be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all this work wasted.
He's clearly out of his mind.
It's not broken.
I wasn't bad.
It didn't help much.
The snow has not stopped.
There was no snow.
I'm sure he'll let you come.
You're not doing anything!
No matter who started and why.
It doesn't seem so complicated anymore.
That doesn't look right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like they poured it on me.
I slowly realized that I misunderstood him.
The previous day was snowing.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your confidence in me.
This happened at the beginning of the previous week.
This happened on the day of our marriage, darling.
There had to be a reason for this.
It happened suddenly.
This happened when he was outside.
It happened to me several times.
Sometimes it happens.
It's happening to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
They have their own value.
The rain has been raining since Tuesday.
I think all fat people should be dieting.
I think everyone's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you'll get along well with your neighbors.
I find his novel boring.
I think there's been a few movies out.
I think I can do it.
I don't think I'd be able to kill him.
I don't think I could kill him.
I don't think I understand.
I feel better.
I think I have the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm losing my head.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
It's like I saw a rat.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's correct.
It's a very small probability, in my opinion, that you're going to be able to do that from yourself.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think it's unfair.
I think so.
I think it was Tom who helped Mari.
I think it'd be better if you left now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor could have died.
I think you'll get along well with your neighbors.
I think there's someone in the door.
I don't think something's wrong.
I'll find spiders for candy.
I think he's at home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget that.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I'm thinking, so I exist.
I don't think it makes any sense to try to convince him.
I think they did a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think the time will solve this problem.
I think Tom was already there.
I think Tomi is exhilarating.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Thomas wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom can help.
I think Thomas wins.
I think we can handle it.
I think we need to be patient.
I think we've turned the wrong direction somewhere.
I think we should be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all screwed up now.
I think you called the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know what Thomas's girlfriend's name is.
I think you'll approve.
I think you look great.
I guess you'd like it.
I think you misunderstood.
I think you should go in personally.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think your job is very good.
I think you smell nice.
I don't think you've been very convincing.
I think you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I thought if we were going somewhere to eat, it would make us feel better.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I was going to go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought maybe it was worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head exploded.
I've been thinking about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the towel, but it wasn't.
I thought Tomi was still in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought it was you.
I threatened the neighbor to kill him.
It hurts!
It hurts.
I'm under the influence.
It had a huge impact on me.
It's dangerous.
It's a historical scene.
It's hard to put it into practice that it was about.
It's hard for everyone to get in the mood.
It's hard for everyone to do it.
I have no doubt if it will work.
It's very late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's about time you started a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
It's basically your fault.
It's in the kitchen.
It's wonderful.
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We need to prepare for the future.
You need a good rest.
It's never too late to learn.
I'm glad to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke alarm cannot be turned off.
This is not the best solution.
It's not the right solution.
It's not too much to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This is not the XIX century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It's not right to speak with your mouth.
It's snowing.
Still moving.
Wow, it's a very bad time today!
It's stupid, dear.
Thirty meters long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him to do.
It's on you.
This is useful information.
The heat is high at night.
It's very important to wash your hands thoroughly after replacing the baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It'll be dangerous.
It'll be dark when we get home.
You'll be ready when you need it.
He'll be ready when he has to.
It will take a while to wear glasses.
He's going to go down soon.
It'll work when I replace the polarities.
Therefore, it seems bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like I don't need me here.
You could use a razor.
Looks like you're not feeling well here.
You seem to have thought of everything.
That makes me sad.
That matters.
It could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This can save your life.
Maybe we'd enjoy it if we tried it.
Maybe I'm gonna be late.
You need to wash it.
You have to report something.
It must have been love.
They must have stolen it.
You have to fix it.
He never existed.
It should never have happened.
I lied to him that I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tom not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you I'm okay.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tomi.
I have a question for you, too.
I've been bathing for a long time.
I've been in the tub for a long time.
I've arranged it.
I was on my 58th trip.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the zoo yesterday.
I took my shoes off.
I totally forgot.
It would probably be cheaper elsewhere.
It was raining yesterday morning.
It happened yesterday.
It's raining a lot.
I'm training two hours a day.
I traveled all over Russia.
I went to the U.S. in cross-section.
Actually, it works.
It's really sad.
I tried everything to keep him alive.
I tried to forget.
I was trying to help Tom.
I'd trust my life.
I'm constantly trying to get to know you.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice flag.
Big brother cat.
It's a little early for drinking, isn't it?
It's a boring word.
This is a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, at least on paper.
A gray stone building.
It's a housekeeper dog.
It's half an hour till lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's completely dark outside.
This is all mine.
It's okay, it's over.
That's nice and good theory, but will it work in practice?
It's all your fault.
It's 7 o'clock.
It's already in progress.
It's ten o'clock in the evening.
One of my dreams was always living next to a river.
It's always the same thing.
Environmental disaster.
It's a stupid business, Watson, an excuse, a dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
What a shame!
I'm sorry I'm late.
It's a shame Tomi is leaving.
It's a pretty big bit of weird.
It's a nightmare.
It's cold.
It's just as art as much as science.
That's the past.
She's in school.
A very dangerous sport, where a small mistake can lead to a serious injury.
It's a very old book.
It's a waste of money.
That's a strange question.
That's terrible.
It was a crazy week.
It was a long day.
It was an amazing trip.
This day is exhausting.
It's a tough day.
This happened earlier.
It wasn't any week.
It's been two years since she left.
That's better.
It's better to hang the garden at night.
Firelight.
Oh, my God.
Getting on a cheaper bus.
It's Chinese to me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed every Sunday.
Closed Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold at home.
It's cold.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you get a sweater?
It is known that the bear loves honey.
It doesn't matter if Tom did it or didn't.
It's totally normal.
It's okay now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep here.
That's very nice.
It's done!
It's easier not to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave from far away.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
The bus seemed late.
That sounds ridiculous.
It seems like it was only yesterday that we went to school together.
It doesn't seem like anything's changed.
It looks weird.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's not in a hurry.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
Looks like you're honest with me.
You seem to be wrong to me.
Looks like we're going to have an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
My dear.
It's fair to get the same pay for the same job.
It's not perfect.
It's far from the ideal.
This is yours.
You know, that's funny.
He's starting to get stuck.
He's starting to become a fool.
We're gonna have a hard time.
It won't be easy.
It's lucky to see the star of the sun.
It's good to be hot.
Learning is good.
It's great you could come.
I'm sure you'll laugh.
It's not hard to get to that conclusion.
It's hard to believe that all this time was clean and sunny.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a bench in this town that can be slept in.
It's hard to put it in words.
It's hard to express words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
It's kind of nice.
He's got a very big head.
He's tall.
The children are already in bed.
Stop with the money.
It's hotter than usual tonight.
It's illegal.
This is important.
It is important that parents stand on one side when raising children.
It's important to help those in trouble.
This is impossible for me.
You have to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to meet your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your conditions.
You don't know what tomorrow will bring.
It's incredible, you know?
This is inevitable.
That's inspiring.
Just a feeling.
Just move.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets into trouble again.
It's just a phone.
I just don't want to die today.
It's pretty hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
It's nice of you to say that.
It's late.
There's a laundry today.
It's like a sub-seater field, and the turtles, they're over it, they're over the sharks, like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's pathetic how he lives.
It's too cold for swimming.
This is my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
It's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
He's not as guarded as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
It won't happen.
It's not your job to change Egypt.
This isn't mine.
It's not my fault.
It's not negociable.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This is not the XIX century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not about what you're doing, it's about how you do it.
It's not worth crying about.
I didn't talk to you.
I didn't tell you.
I didn't tell you.
There is no point in confessing to the priest if you do not testify to sin.
It doesn't make sense to go through the past.
It's snow.
It's obviously broken.
Obviously impossible.
It's obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It's not a problem if some people think it's a peasant.
It's okay if you're gay.
“It’s been three months, and Tomi says he talks fluently about French.
It's only three days.
The park is on the other side.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It feels like I'm pouring it out.
He opened his wings.
It's amazing.
It's pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these misantropic theories is to express in the assessment of the working class, saving imperialism from the responsibility of the blood wars he's made, and to believe the core of the thought that the causes of the aggressive tendencies of man born into infinite wars are the causes of man's congenital tendencies.
It's very urgent.
It rains in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
That's a big number.
That's where it is.
It's a very important thing to ask someone how much he's looking for.
They say the Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston now.
It's so good to stay home.
Still moving.
It's suicide.
This is technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
This is the least I can do.
It's theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
You still have to answer that.
It's time to take our tent.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I need to cut my hair off.
It's time to relax.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's time to do something about it.
Tom has his birthday today.
That's Tom's decision.
Tomi's word is against Mari's word.
It's too dark to play ball.
It's expensive for me.
Now it's too hot for this.
Late grief.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's a typical autumn time.
It's a bad thing to get cold.
It's ugly, it's ugly, it's yellow, and it's nothing.
It's under the table.
Maybe it's not as stupid as you think.
It is unlikely that anything serious will happen.
It depends on them now.
It's up to you to go there or not.
Very attractive.
Very boring.
It's cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very confusing.
It's really fun.
It costs a lot to live here.
Very nice of you.
It's very white.
It's hot.
That's what we agreed on.
That's your only chance.
About 10,000 hours of learning is needed to learn a language.
You have to be bold to succeed.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
It took me nearly three years to build my house.
Everyone was unexpectedly understood.
It took about an hour.
It took me a lot of time to write this book.
It took me more than a month to get rid of the cold.
It took Tom a long time to choose a pair of shoes.
It took me a long time, but eventually I found it.
I turned to a little alley.
I'm flattered.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was a good party.
It was a dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a silly question.
It was a stupid idea.
This was a tragic accident.
It was really great food.
It was a waste of time for all of us.
It was awful weird.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
It was chaotic.
It was obviously very enjoyable.
We had fun last night.
It was hard first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was a heat, and it was a mating time.
It was just a run.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost dark.
This was not long before John had an idea. John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
It wasn't a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It wasn't easy for me to keep my promise.
That was a low blow on the belt.
It wasn't interesting.
I wasn't the one who cut the door.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't purposeful.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't that bad.
It wasn't the first time they did this.
It wasn't Tom.
It was just a joke.
I only found out his true intention when I met him.
It didn't hurt.
It fell last night.
It was weird.
That was really interesting.
It was really fast.
It was really sad.
It was Sikere.
That was great.
That's all I could think about.
It was the worst pain I've ever experienced.
Tom's coming.
It was kept completely secret.
It was uncertain if he would marry her.
That was urgent.
In a few days, the whole thing will end.
In a few days, it'll all come down.
It'll be over in a few days.
It takes five or ten years to complete the technology.
This will grow back.
That's what's gonna happen.
It'll rain for a week if it doesn't stop tomorrow.
This will threaten the welfare of the city.
We don't have to come back tomorrow.
You don't have to do that anymore.
It won't take much time.
It worked beautiful.
It works perfectly with your iPhone.
That would be dangerous.
That would be different.
It's hard for me to get out of here.
It would be pointless.
It would have been better if it had already been settled.
It's not brave, it's stupid!
It would have been better if we hadn't done it.
I underestimated Tom.
I see.
I understand that it's uncomfortable for you, but don't worry.
I know what you're talking about, but I don't know what you're talking about.
I understand what you're saying, but it doesn't work.
I understand your problem.
I updated my software.
I need a job right away.
I used to be able to do it, but not anymore.
I used to be married.
I used to drink a lot of coke, but now I'm just drinking water.
I had a dog.
I lived next to a park.
I used to live in the neighborhood of a park.
I loved swimming. Swimming was my favorite sport in high school.
I've never eaten meat before.
I slept in an extra bed before I visited my aunt and uncle.
I used to work at a restaurant.
I'm using this.
