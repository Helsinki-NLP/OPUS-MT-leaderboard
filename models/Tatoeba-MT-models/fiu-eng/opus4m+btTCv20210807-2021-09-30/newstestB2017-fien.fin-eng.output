A 28-year-old cook was found dead in the Sanfrance shopping center
Just recently moved to San Francisco, a 28-year-old cook was found dead at the local mall portal this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother.
The body found at the Westfield Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as a Sanfrancescian Frank Galicia, a 28-year-old law firm in San Francisco.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told the TV company ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, previously working as a cook in Boston, had found his dream job as a chef at the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock to them all.
“We’re a small and tight team, like a family.
\"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends.
Louis Galicia tells Frank that he had lived in the hostels first, but he had finally got his order.
\"He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend,\" Louis Galicia told the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being with the family was to put food to us all,\" Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be in dispute with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the power.
Despite all the misunderstandings in the world, he was the diamond of a nightmare that shined every day, he says.
All the people who know about the case are asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's reference number 415-575-44.
New work fighting activities are required by lawmakers.
The representatives of British junior doctors, who are mainly specialised in Finland, have been engaged in their trade union and have asked for permission for new work-fighting activities in a dispute on a new employment contract.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is seeking support for additional work-fighting activities in its entire government from the beginning of September.
According to the JDC, ministers have not solved any problems with the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in a vote in July.
58% of the members participating in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday evening, the Chairman of the Junior Doctor’s Committee Ellen McCourt published a letter to the members of the JDC in which he says that the government “was a victim of self-control” on the issues that McCourt said led to the fight against the agreement.
The letter reads: “In this light, the Government of the JDC has fully rejected the new proposal for a contract and calls for new formal negotiations to be held on all our concerns.
In response to the government's difficulty, the Government of the JDC has today submitted a formal request to the BMA Government, in which it is requesting permission to carry out the least-developed work struggles since the beginning of September.
Due to this debate, junior doctors have been in the strike six times this year, which included the first complete work-offs ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, director of the BMA junior doctor, resigned after the vote, for he did not accept the negotiated contractual terms which BMA had recommended.
Malawana told BMA members that the agreement was good and should be accepted. The vote was attended by 54,000 junior doctors and a medical student.
After the vote, the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would enter into force and apply to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
It was an gesture that decided the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday in order to reach an agreement and to bring the eight-month term war and economic sanctions to an official conclusion.
However, when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish civil servant against his brother in the golden hall of his palace in St. Petersburg, I had a clear impression that the greater desire for reconciliation was on Ankara.
The parties did,
But Putin's smile looked thin, and he didn't even get warm with his own breathtaking measure.
In contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke repeatedly about his “good friend, Mr Putin,” according to a report five times.
I didn't stay on the bills myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote Erdogan’s behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I understood his enthusiasm on the contrary.
But Putin's steady vileys showed that the Russian chief has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down the border of Syria.
Moscow's reaction to the event was a waste of time.
Putin attacked me tightly and accused me of stabbing his back.
The insult was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
Getting true trust back will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
Over the months, the most controlled media of the state were engaged in a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious were the accusations of top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trafficking in ISIS-controlled areas in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the charges.
However, the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move forward.
At the end of the day, this meeting was only organised so that Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could win some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring a ceasefire to Ankara are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost out of power in a failed coup last month.
Another terrorist attack in Turkey has clearly shaken him as well.
The agreement also has an economic impact.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey tightly, especially the charter flight ban, as usually millions of Russian tourists travel to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly take care of relief when air traffic can eventually be continued.
They put their faith in the late-sunson attack on the Mediterranean.
And yet this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall, while the import of Turkish agricultural products will be allowed again.
“The truth is, the tomatoes came back here, the newspaper was written in the Vedemost article.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West, because it believes that the West reacts to the attempt to capture your silence.
Without forgetting the old beauty of the EU accession negotiations in Turkey and the absence of Putin in matters. Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the cool spaces and to undermine Turkey's ties to the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was obvious to Moscow, who was concerned about the change of power.
Therefore, Russia and Turkey could, in their top meeting in the French sea scenes, convey a picture that an analyst described as a “false alliance”: two countries that experience being abandoned by the West, and in a costly manner, combine their power.
Despite public reconciliation, these two still have great differences.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created a picture of itself as a peace builder, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It says a lot that, almost three hours after the initial negotiations, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not discussed the subject at all.
The Turkish President refused to answer the question of the differences between the countries, while Putin stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could seek agreement in Syria.
Taking into account the possibility of a complete disaster caused by Turkey, a member of NATO, when shooting down a Russian combat machine, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two heads of state are once again speaking.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from their customers outside of Scotland
According to the CEO of the RBS Bank, the activities of the bank outside of Scotland will be reduced in such a way that it will continue to provide only business services, i.e. back office services.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand originally joined the bank’s global goals.
The bank had to retreat when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and was forced to save.
During that period, brands have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors millions of pounds of international sport, including Six Nations rubby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it is considered right to have more national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will remain in the use of Scottish customers, but will not be used as a abbreviation of RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are converted into NatWeste, except for head office and stock exchange listings.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwania was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Inverness Shehir.
He said to the BBC Scotland: “RBS becomes an investment brand and because of the fact that our employees are employed because we are now becoming much more of a bank of different brands.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations, and has increased the profile of different brands in sponsoring sport.
“Now is the right time to move to a bank with different brands, because it is essentially a question of how we can make a bank better for customers,” says the bank’s CEO.
“It would have been very clever three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced the brands.
But our work and focus on the needs of our customers instead of our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettor was riding Predilection to win in Newmarket and won his 3,000th win.
After winning the champagne twice in a row in Newmarket, Dettor took over the 3,000th win.
Jockey Frankie Dettor confirmed his $3,000 win in the British Championship in Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone by riding his horse Predilection twice on the same night on the track of his municipality. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
Italian Dettor, 45, is the sixth jockey, which reaches this milestone in a flat-track race.
He's been hit by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggett, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three times the master jockey Detector, who previously won in Ghayyar, says: “This is special.
My feelings are on the ground because my family is here too.
I'm very glad this happened in Newmarket because I just ended up here 30 years ago.
The competition is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a 20,000-person audience.
I am relieved and feel great humility.
Dettor takes charms with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in the contests, and they are champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-fold master Sir Anthony McCoy, who won his record career over 4 300 times.
Master Piggott, ninth Derby winner, 4 493 wins
“Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is no surprise that she has just reached this milestone, which is rarely reached.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactical advancement is what separates him from the rest.
He is a fantastic representative of competition, his enthusiasm and charisma have brought to the species supporters for years.
“I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races if he didn’t compete only on weekends and only in big races!
Seriously speaking, Frankie's riding career in British competitions has been profitable for nearly 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a vibrant person, which is good for the British race, but above all, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettor expressed his achievement in a way that seemed to jump down the back of his horse.
“From flying to flying landings, Frankie Dettor has been a model for British racing for two decades.
There have been high and lowlands on the road.
He has won numerous major races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996-Magnificent Seven, but he has also survived a plane crash and has been banned for abuse of medications.
When the ban on competition ended three years ago, he had difficulties starting at the beginning, but he showed a remarkable character of strength, seemed to his suspects and returned to his best.
And he hasn’t stopped his career for a while – Dettor has recently said he wants to continue his competition until he’s 50 years old.
Putin's head of administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly terminated his chief of administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's believed inner circle for many years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport.
According to the report from the Kremlin, President Putin decided to release Ivanov as Head of the Russian Presidential Administration, but no grounds for dismissal were reported.
He was appointed Vice-President of Ivanov since 2012.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Vaino, born in Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the Moscow Institute of State Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the President’s protocol department and the government’s office, says the Russian-speaking website of the Kremlin.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment: “I am grateful for your confidence.
I believe that the main task of administration is to support your actions as Head of State, which means making drafts of law and controlling how the instructions you give are implemented.
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov had asked for a difference and recommended Vavo to be his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin, and, like Putin, he also has KGB heritage.
He was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, the Russian state television shows, both said Ivanov would withdraw from his mission on his own request.
Despite the smiles shown on the cameras, only a few are convinced, especially under the parliamentary elections.
Are you fired from some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that a man who has been praised as president would suddenly want to lead to Russia’s environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov’s words to Putin, saying: “It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me this very complex and, to some extent, difficult task for four years.
I have now served as President's Executive Director for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service KGB.
When Putin served as Head of the Security Service (FSB) of the KGB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Commander.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
In time, it was thought that Ivanov might have become Russian President Putin after the second season, as the Constitution would have prevented Putin's election for the third season.
However, the mission went to the other area of Putin, Dmitry Medvedeville.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to President only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds - FBI Researchers - star Thomas Gibson was fired after shooting the producer
Gibson was involved in a violent dispute at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios companies that produce the series reported a kick in their joint communications.
As Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, Gibson had filed an apology on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
“We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened, he says when he announces.
Information on how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents, published later, will be reported in ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously played by Dharma & Greg in the comedy series, Gibson, a 54-year-old, has been involved in the series since its first production period, i.e. since 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul on it for the last twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
“I was hoping to see it until the end of the series, but it’s no longer possible.
I would like to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production group and the most important: the best fans that the series could ever have hoped for.
The 12th season of production begins in the United States on September 28th.
The mysterious beach of the fish in the Banffish Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help to identify fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are windmills that have fallen into the ground as an image of the circular storm.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published a visual material in Periscope and hoped to receive an answer to the emergence of these five-centred fish.
Queensferry is now connected to Fifeen
The EUR 1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The engineers have connected Queensferry's crossing bridge to the north deck and the bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fifee.
It is the first of the four sections between the covers – which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 vinoco-fibres.
The EUR 1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The minister of office, Keith Brown, visited the workplace today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing bridge.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in the construction of the bridge. More than 30,000 concrete and steel have been used to build this bridge section.
Despite mass size and weight, the construction of the bridge between the bridge and the bridge is a fine operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
The entire bridge now has almost 79%, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete pain in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be raised.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, says: “The completion of the first bridge section is always a significant urethra in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the peak of the road and water construction industry.
When the last part of the road cover was installed and connected to the road cover of the North Tower, then we had to close the remaining North Pole (i.e. the Earth) cell.
This was done by drawing 700 millimeters south from the north to the west.
This was a massive and at the same time a massive operation requiring great precision.
Massive, because the terrain has a length of 222 meters and a weight of about 6 000 tons, it was to be drawn up at a angle of about 3%.
And with great precision, because the tolerances that the working team had to follow were very small – only a few millimetres.
It all went well.
Moelfre Bay rescue facility says about three men’s wonders
Anglesey, the three men who took water from his fishing boat, were saved as a miracle shop.
Moelfre RNLI’s maritime rescue station made a alert on Friday at 13.20 local time in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued to run uncontrollable without a driver.
“We saw the boat orbiting right next to them and imagined the worst,” says Vince Jones, who drives Moelfre’s lifeboat.
“By the time we got to the water, the strong winds were lucky to have carried the boat away from them.
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, while the third, aged 60, was found exhausted by a boy and without life jackets.
All of them were taken to the coastal rescue ship and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says: “It’s a miracle that these three men in the water are still alive and in perfect condition.
The boat had an emergency extinguisher in the engine, but for some reason it had been disembarked in connection with the crash of the boat from a man of time.
They really had the luck in their journey.
Pokémon Go hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to follow how the world changes.
During the last decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to stay inside to stare at their squares.
Pokémon Go makes people stand up on the couch and move.
Originally, the screen time took only a watch on the TV, then video games came along and the last smartphone.
So it’s amazing to note that technology and outdoors don’t shut each other out.
This, of course, refers to Pokémon Go. Pokémon Go is a game application whose characters come from a video game created in the 1990s (which were later made in a cartoon series, playing cards, and other accompanying products).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also stopped slightly before the new game began to be available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The ransom in other countries was delayed due to huge interest, which overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users in the Pokémon Go game passed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
How does the game work?
In short, the players will go out looking for Pokémon on their smartphone, which will be monitored using GPS. When the Pokémon is found, it can be photographed (with a phone screenshot) or a \"capture\".
Villitus has strangled a generation of video games when she was younger and raised the backs on the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that a middle-liner will take in a day.
Washington Post recently reported an Apple Watch smart watch Cardiogram application that found within two days of the game launch that the number of people moving for 30 minutes per day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. The cardiogram follows 35,000 users.
The company does not know who users play Pokémon Go game, it only sees the raw data of the physical activity volumes.
Many public health campaigns in which people are encouraged to stand on the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have fallen into the ears of the deaf because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have appeared to be unhappy.
However, the importance of the movement should not be reduced.
The likelihood of regularly moving is less likely to get cancer or depression.
Sports helps with weight management, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large amount of other benefits.
The fineness of the Pokémon Go game is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
This is how it achieves three basics that support health – physical activity, fresh air and sun and joy.
During the hunt, it is possible to even make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes bad-bodied pleasures.
And yes, someone can walk towards the door when they play.
What about it?
The breakthrough is done.
For even though smartphone applications like Fitbit may have been able to monitor your activity earlier, they did not have reason to move forward, as Pokémon Go does.
The update is lost, and the use is reduced in time.
However, the success of Pokémon will result in more games where applications and virtual reality are combined with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity of people leaving the hunt and improve their condition and health.

Simone Biles caught gold in a multiplayer game of women's toys
Forget the pressure.
Forget the jump.
Simone Biles is immune to all of them.
Dynamic jump.
It's hard to make a boom.
The jaws are breathable with permana.
Great for everything.
And now I'm finally an Olympic winner.
The American 19-year-old Teline Powermaker won the championship on Thursday and raised the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic Lights.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of the Silver-Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronzeist Aliya Mustafina.
The US Simone Biles performs in the boom of the women’s stand-alone multi-playing final on Thursday in Rio’s 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The party became the fourth consecutive and the fifth American woman of all time, who won the championship of a multi-play, thus strengthening his reputation as the best of his generation or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears when his final total points came to light and his long way to this moment ended.
Achievement takes the species to a completely new dimension and raises him to the same category with other superstars like Michael Phelps:
Biles has been completely superior to his race for the last three years. He has won 15 World Championships of gold, of which 10 gold, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programs that in 1984, the Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him “the greatest Teline Powerer of all time.”
There was still one final competition in Brazil, which was first and foremost between Biles and his self and the burden of excessive expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Going home to Texas Spring less than a handful of gold medals would be disappointed.
The US Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman will hug the gold and silver in the final of the multi-play of the women's teline power competition in Rio 2016 in the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11 August 2016
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on i for the travelers of Martha Karoly, who was co-ordinated and now retired.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything before when he was at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program, which includes a series of volts known as his card, has been adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic arena.
It's not a coincidence.
His grandparents already have a small adoption and coach Aimee Boorman's mother has become a powerful figure. Boorman found a girl when this was a day-care trip to the gym where Boorman coached.
He has not lost any multi-player competition since summer 2013, and the winning pipe is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina reached a small lead with two tours, it was like fabrication.
There was a boom and a permant in which Biles is a defensive world champion.
He returned to the leading position after getting 15.433 points out of the boom and crowned the final result with 15.933 points.
Raisman gently embraced him when they waited for the final points – which was just a formality – and tears began to appear around the red, white and blue glazing border color when the dream he once wrote in his playbook was realized.
Raisman's performance was a minor revolution for four years ago, when he first split the third place, but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in the resumption round.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, which the Americans call the team \"mump\", was clearly in front of Mustafina.
He sent planes to the public after his permanto program and thus became a winner of a loss position, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Bilesis is concerned, this 20-year-old tweet is now entirely new:
Police report three music in the car as victims of a serial killer
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating massacre for ten years. Victims were sitting in a car and listening to music when they were shot, reports the police release on Thursday.
According to the authorities, a car parked in the street arm of 12 June was shot in Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Elis' daughter Maleah.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, where he shot eight shots with a handgun, and then fled with another car, the news says.
The police suspect that the cause of the three-year death was not a robbery, because the attacker did not take handbags or 2 900 dollars found in the hearing of the second adult victim.
Officer of the Phoenix Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard says the police are now investigating whether death has been linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks, mainly in areas inhabited by Latin Americans within four months.
“It’s common for the events that they have occurred in residential areas at home,” Howard told the CBS subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have a number of vehicles, including the brown Nissan in the late 1990s, the black BMW and the white Cadillac or Lincoln in the late 1990s.
Scientists do not want to reveal what led them to decide that the attacks are related to each other and that their factor is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Elis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The witness told the police that the three were often sitting in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police released a statement stating that only half an hour before the death of the three-year-old gun was fired, which is believed to be the same in both cases.
Scientists found mosquitoes and took from the car seat a bullet and a bullet chip from the engine.
The mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephalia: “The things become better.
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But unlike most other age-brothers, Edmund has a microcephal, or birth-born infantry, due to his mother Elizabeth Picciuton's genetic disorder, which he was not aware of when he was pregnant.
“When I brought Edmund home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn’t get through this.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
What is not true – of course you are committed to it, he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and perhaps never survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
“My first reaction was that I didn’t believe there was any such practice anymore,” Picciuto says.
Edmund walks with the steering wheel.
Edmund got up to sit down and started until he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowing down his own pace.
He walks with help and drives a bicycle.
He is happy to play with his two brothers and love singing.
Elizabeth presents Edmund's invention of a sign in which he means a song to me.
\"We teach him a sign language,\" Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not just mean a common sign language, but also a sign of Edmund’s own.
There may be a number of different diseases behind microcephalia: hereditary, such as Edmund's case, or pregnancy-time viral infections such as ashes or ziclavirus.
There are great variations in the symptoms and predictions.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of those who have been infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional storm caused by the uncertain future.
“I kept doing what we do,
What we do -
He still doesn't know.
“I haven’t asked a forecast in a while, because I don’t think anyone can give it to me.”
But Picciuto has hope to give advice to mothers whose children have birth defects caused by the Zikavirus.
Things are getting better.
Things usually work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rains and floods caused massive rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
The Governor of Louisiana declared on Friday a state of emergency due to heavy rains and widespread floods. More rains in the state are still expected on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers of South Louisiana and South Mississippi flooded and spread to a vast area as a result of heavy rainfalls.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards reports that state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that aid is already on their way to flood areas.
The National Security and Emergency Governor's Office, Mike Steele, reports that the Agency receives requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandboxes.
According to Steele, only tens of thousands of sandfalls have been requested by the district of Tangipaho.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most parts of South Louisiana.
According to the weather notice, water can be added to the area from 76 to 27 mm more.
A flood warning was given in South Alabama on Friday when the rains continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, is expected to rise to record heights.
According to a weather forecast by Alek Krautmann, many of the houses on the banks of rivers can be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that floods in the county of Ascension are a threat, as flooding rivers slowly clear up Lake Lake Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi border, was already higher than ever on Friday at 9am.
The rescue work continued in the districts of Amien and Wilkinson in Southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepdads, were previously close to Gloria’s rescue team on Friday.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose quickly during the night.
He had been warned by another boy who was nearing him.
\"We got up, and the water came with a constant feed,\" Hansford said.
It stretched to my waist...
His wife told Hansford that he had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years he lived in the region.
Hansford says that he and his family have injuries, and he is the only swimmer of them.
The rescue workers had saved all three large army-style trucks and took them to a fire station in Gluster, where they had to protect on Friday.
The weather forecaster Krautmann says floods are spreading rapidly to a large extent when the hardships continue, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells us about the information received from a observer close to Livingston, according to which almost 350 mm had been rained between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil has been so wet after the rains that began on Wednesday.
The authorities say that due to the flooding of heavy rainfalls and streets, the inhabitants of the Tangipaho County were forced to save their homes and that the classes had to be canceled in five school districts.
A member of the City Council of Tangipahoa had told the CBS subsidiary WWL of the television and radio company that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both of them.
The district leader, Robby Miller, says that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pets who had remained a flood of prisoners.
There are shelters for those who have been evacuated to the cities of Amien and Hammond.
“They get back to their homes when the water starts to retreat,” he says.
Almost twenty streets were closed in the district of Tangipaho due to the flood, and residents were offered sand jackets to try to prevent water from accessing their homes and businesses.
“For the last time, we experienced a great flood in March,” says Lacy Landrum, a city government member.
This flood seems like the same.
In Mississip, rain continued flat on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, says Rupert Lacy, the rescue director of Harrison County.
Lacy reports that on Thursday, a handful of people were reported in a house under the flood, but on Friday there had been no information.
The director of the Shopper Value Foods store Keith Townson tells us that he has lived in the Amita region for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen it before, and more rains all the time.”
A lot of bullets on his body are six-year-old Mahada Brown who survives the Philadelphia shooting scene.
Police say there's a 6-year-old boy shot in Philadelphia who's already the second six-year-old shot in the city this week.
His grandparents told him the boy was Mahaha Brown on the CBS Philadelphia channel.
According to grandparents, the boy had several wounds in the joints, the leg, the arm and the stomach, but he was unconscious when he was taken to the hospital.
“He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets,” said the boy’s grandmother Delores Melenez to the television company.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital, and he has been subjected to several cuts.
The family tells the TV company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was starting the first class at a local sub-level.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old were also shot.
Another 29-year-old state was reported to be critical and two other states were stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.
According to the TV company, the child was found on the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether another of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a cross between many armed men.
The event site was full of attack weapons-type mosquitoes that originated from different attack weapons.
“It is absolutely clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were mosquitoes on both sides of the sidewalk.
There have been a number of armed fighters on the site, and they have been actively involved in the shooting, and the Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and the police say they're going through surveillance videos.
Another shooting victim in the city this week was a 6-year-old girl whose hand was deceived by her playing on Tuesday in front of her home in West Oak Lane.
The girl is recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
In this name, I call the Olympic team of women's artificial power, and there are more than one reason why.
First of all, I have been in every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, this team of three gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren-Laurie - Hernandez, has inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of the team, supplemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everything proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also confirmed the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best female liner has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
This is great.
At the former Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise winner of the races, and the whole of America was cheered up.
Now, the world has been able to prove the amazing performances and surprising and masterful artificial performances of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez.
Simon became a fourth consecutive American on Thursday, who won gold in a multiplayer match for women.
Teammate Aly Raisman won the silver.
The views are at the top of such a species, but the same does not seem to be visible on the whole country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same trail as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the last five \"Final Five\", for in the next Olympics, there will be only four gymnastics, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that tele-powering is an expensive sport and gymnastics are mainly practiced in private telecommunications euros, which are maintained by their parents. Parents pay for training costs, facilities, travels, performances, competition fees, hotel charges (trainers, gymnastics and family members) etc.
Most of the space of the artificial slots is located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support their operations.
The teaching of the Teline Power Planters takes place in these clubs, and it means a costly and long-term commitment to the families of gymnastics.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both trained the species's enthusiasts since they began the teline exercise.
We need to organise a more affordable and more accessible stand-alone education for countless young girls whose enthusiasm for Simone, Gabby, and Laurie have raised.
I founded my own artificial fitness foundation 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlems have offered a free or affordable opportunity for more than 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Latin American) and these young people have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to my hometown of Detroit to provide high-quality artificial power for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic race.
Teline power building develops strength, nudity and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline, and determination.
This combination brings lasting benefits throughout life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has been excited about thousands of young girls who now want to start a standoff, and it's amazing.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real-girl power you showed when you won the Olympic gold, and for motivating so many young girls from backgrounds to start their way into a prosperous, strong and successful young woman.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepared for new strikes
Ministers wished to decide to dispute the changes to remuneration and working conditions by accepting a renewed agreement with the BMA (British Medical Association), but 37,000 so-called junior physicians rejected the proposal by 58%.
In July, Minister of Health Hunt announced plans to make the deal compulsory and said that the British public health system (NHS) was “no one country” and that any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moving to a new agreement that contains changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care in non-social times.
Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Senior Medical Committee, said yesterday: “Junior doctors are still very prepared for the proposed agreement, and the particular fear is that it will accelerate the current labour market crisis and that it will not treat all doctors in a fair manner.
It is only eight weeks after the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so now we have to move forward, because the time is coming to an end.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has taken an undesired approach to the discussion companies and sometimes even in no way reacted.
Even though Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must now act, repeal the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this doesn't happen, junior doctors are ready for new work-fighting measures.
At the end of April, the previous strike postponed almost 13,000 routine measures and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consultants were asked to support the strike physicians.
Ministers hoped to get a dispute on changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the professionals of the British Medical Association.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary of 54,000 junior doctors to be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS employees, appealed to junior doctors that they would not enter new strikes.
Mortimer says: “Working activities achieve very little or nothing, but they create pressure on the teams and services at the border, and cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, nursing staff and their families.
For the past two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Medical Committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and other bodies, we have welcomed their concerns about the role and the disclosure of the concerns of the supervisor.
The workers were hopeful to have continued positive commitment to other important topics – such as development, flexibility of education, additional training from careers, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, free of study and gender pay gap in the treatment sector – were a sign of how seriously the workers, Health Education England, and the Ministry of Health and Health want to stick to BMA's agreements with Marras, bee and May.
A medicine that pays up to $2.40 a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are receiving about €2.40 a day, when authorities recommended it to be given to more people and longer-term use.
Antidepressant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The drug is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or a new heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) has instructed patients to be given ticagrelor for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) that is part of the British Public Health System (NHS) has advised that ticagrelor should be given for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems further.
In England, about 140,000 people get a heart attack every year, with a quarter of them getting a heart attack or having a stroke.
As a cause of heart attacks and strokes, there is a fat source in the walls of the blood vessels that generates plaques.
If a plaque cracks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot is removed, it can flow with the blood circulation and prevent blood flow into the brain, resulting in stroke.
The risk of a new attack is higher in people who have had a heart attack.
The ticagrelor produced by the British AstraZenecan, which is sold under the name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of interpreters.
The draft NICE programme today recommends that ticagrelor be given for the next 90 mg for 12 months, followed by a dose reduction of 60 milligrams and an aspirin twice daily for a further three years.
Professor Carole Longson, who is evaluating the introduction of treatment methods, says: “Although effective methods of treatment that prevent the progression of the disease and the emergence of symptoms are available, up to a quarter of those who have had a heart attack will receive a new attack or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
The fear of regeneration can have a very negative impact on the quality of human life.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it.
As data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular in the case of bleeding risk, are limited if used for more than three years, it is not recommended to use the treatment method for a longer period.
Due to the political correcting atmosphere, the vote in Muslim areas flourished.
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was fired last year for corruption, resulting in a report by the government.
The political correcting atmosphere led to the closure of the eyes from a wide range of elections in Muslim communities, reveals the government report published today.
The former Minister of the Government, Sir Eric Pickles, harshly criticized the police, the election observers and the city councils for the fact that they have closed their eyes because of the hypersensitivity to the elections and religion.
According to Pikles, the fear of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form security chains outside the polls, so that scared voters could be protected.
He suggests that voters should present a certificate of identity in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter must only state his or her name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that the fingers be cast in an uninitiated music after voting so that no one can vote twice.
We need to protect the protesters more,\" says Sir Eric.
He calls for journalists' access to the documents of the Government and to the decisions of informal commissions and working groups to be improved.
“The aim is not only to prevent electoral prosperity, but also to combat fraud and culture favouring corruption and economic interests in more extensive local governments,” he said.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the Eastern London Tower Hamlet poll scandal.
Last year, the Special Election Court ordered that then mayor Lutfur Rahman should be separated from his duties due to corruption and numerous unlawful practices.
The court found that Rahman was abusing the religious sense of his Muslim community and depressing his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamism.
Rahman was said to be based on his campaign on the religious obligation of every religious Muslim of the believer to vote for him.
Of the votes, up to 300 were questionable or given in a sincere manner by making the person vote for another person.
Sir Eric said the evidence of the wild was obtained from the whole country.
He expressed particular concern about the postal election, in which members of the Muslim community were told that they had pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (in the photo) made a number of proposals to correct the voting system, including the requirement for a ID card at the polling point.
The report states: “There has been evidence that some members of vulnerable ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of the older members. This was particularly in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh-backed communities.
\"We were concerned that... the state institutions had closed their eyes on such an action, politically due to the hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion,\" he said.
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to ensure that the system can be clean, including the prohibition of processing postal ballots from political activists, in order to prevent voting.
The report under review at Theresa May will also require more stringent checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the register of voting rights for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of alternatives for which voters would be required to issue an ID card before voting.
Getting the fingers into an uninitiated music after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a three-year limit on requests for automatic mailing.
Prohibition of the processing of voice and postal envelopes sent by full mail from political activists.
The police have the right to form surveillance chains around the polls.
Amendment of the law to facilitate the raising of grounds of fear under the 1983 Act of Representation of the People Act on the Extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at voting places.
Only allow English to vote at places of vote (except for Wales).
Strengthening training in order to ensure that staff are monitored by the rule that only one person can go to the ballot box at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the London police and considers it amazing that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlet incident.
\"The Court of Justice separated Lutfur Rahman and his representative from his duties because of corruption and numerous unlawful practices,\" he said.
He was found guilty without suspicion of doubt, and the criminal evidence threshold exceeded many grounds.
He also criticized the ineffective and unscrupulous controls of the departments responsible for the electoral lists of the City Council.
“The decision of the Court of Justice last year in the case of Tower Hamlet was a wake-up,” says Sir Eric.
“Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all Parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and concealed election of some parties and its denial.
The view of the Olympic cyclist with Duchess Catherine and other dual beings in Rio Olympics
This week, the fans of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games were vibrating from the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, with an amazing view of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But according to the social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is not the only champion to fight for the championship, who has an understanding of a well-known person.
In honor of Rio's competitions and all the famous faces in our screens, FEMAIL gathered a list of all the Olympic players with a clear view of Hollywood.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellisonia (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the dual being of Duchess Catherine on the pyörödäds, many people have recorded in social media, how one of the archbishops could be the double brother of Leonardo DiCaprio.
The U.S. men's archery team Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after the pictures he published, where he is alarmingly reminding of the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the noise of social media and admitted that he had heard of DiCaprio since he was a child.
“I don’t see the sameness so great, except for the beard and the mustache,” Brady Huffington told Post.
He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment.
In London’s 2012 competitions, British long-term jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were introduced even more in these races.
Alya Mustafina, a high-sighted Russian gymnastic, has been described as the dual being of a Cuban American singer Gloria Estefan.
On the other hand, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghi has been compared to Matthew Morrison, known as the Glee TV series for many years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is a “athletic version” of the Inception movie actor.
Similarly, for a long time, the tennis player Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have been quoted, which is highlighted by both strong eyebrows and lips.
The swimming hopdist, Yulia Efimova of Russia, reminds the actress Annalynne McCordia, and not only because of her beautifully browned skin and white hair, while the US team Nathan Adrian, according to his fans, is a \"athletic version of Joseph Gorgon's Levitt\".
These two iron women, the football star Hope Solo (left) and the Dexter series actor Jennifer Carpenter (e.g.), remind each other of their faces and eyes.
Not the only one: this Twitter user was delighted, while others also saw the same view.
This user wonders if the couple’s consistency is a good reason.
A tweeter recently expressed his joy when, on the internet, others agree on Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter’s consistency.
The American football star and the Dexter series actor truly resemble each other with their face shapes and eyes.
Many have also found similar views in Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney’s smiles and gold winner Gabby Douglas and Anna’s return! movie star Gabrielle Union’s wide smiles.
The Olympic Commander of CBC apologizes for the Chinese swimmer’s death as a pig.
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s fourth instead of the women’s 4 x 200-metre free-switching message impressed the CBC’s direct Olympic report viewers on Wednesday.
The Canadian Broadcasting Company CBC has been forced to apologize since one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had disappeared and died like a pig during the race.
The filmer Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was off when he began shooting his own opinions at the end of the women’s 4 x 200 metres free swimming message.
MacDonaldi, who was included in CBC's selodystism to bring color, heard the saying: \"This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he went out and died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swim at the second part of the message at 1:57.79, and stayed 1.61 seconds from the Taylor Ruck of Canada, allowing the Canadians to swim into China.
The viewers from all over Canada react quickly when they are shocked by the input and language usage of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Does CBC’s browser just say that a 14-year-old Chinese school died like a pig???”
The idiot didn't realize he was still in the shipment.
At the end of the 4 x 200 m free swimming message for women, Chinese Ai Yanhan was described as saying: “This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with a wasteful byron MacDonald's critical comments, and many demanded his resignation.
The Twitists did not arrest their words when they heard how indisputable Byron Macdonald was.
“Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC mission, quickly apologized to MacDonald’s words: “We apologize for the comment on swimming.
We were sorry about the choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened.
The CBC finally had to regret more than 90 times the people who had tweeted the answer to the comment.
Scott Russel, a commentary colleague, had to apologize for MacDonald.
After that, CBC copied and glued his regrets to more than 90 other tweeters’ comments complaining about MacDonald’s speech.
The TV company also made a public apology.
“We are sincerely sorry, of these statements and of the fact that they were sent.
We quickly apologized to our viewers last night, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron’s comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words had to be regretted, and Byron is very sorry about his words.
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his regret at the shipment and tried to defend his speech by saying that he didn’t mean it to be personal.
“I want to apologize to my comment I gave last night after the women’s communication,” McDonald said at the CBC Olympics.
“I talked about a swimmer’s performance, not a person.
It is clear, though, that I did not mean anything derogatory with my words, and I am very sorry.
In Primark, a woman who was in the middle of a shop was shocked by her customers.
Customers didn’t know where to look when a woman took off in the middle of Primark to fit her underwear.
He further aggravated the situation by assessing what he looked like in underwear, taking them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually tried four underwear players at the Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone.
The Primark chain, located at the Folkestone Bouverie Place Mall, where a woman tried her underwear in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
At the same time, the mother of two children in the shop Jenny Davidson says that after testing underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He says of what happened: “People did not believe in their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the store, took the underwear from the shelf, stripped off her own tricks and underwear, and put them on.
He did not try to do it unnoticed, but did it without completely ashamed.
Everyone was staring at him when he took off the underwear he tested, and apparently he didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before he finally decided he didn’t like anything, dress and walk out.
He didn't seem to care about the looks, nor did he think about the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had been wearing?
The 33-year-old Davidson, in Kenttown, continues: “How disgusting it is to think that someone is taking underpants that someone else has used and has not washed them.
It happened on Tuesday afternoon.
“I understand that the sales staff tried to remove these clothing items from sales when the woman had left – what is right.
It would be awful to take the new underwear home and see that someone else has experienced them without being washed after that, add Davidson.
Primark’s spokesman commented on the matter by saying: “Primark is aware of the situation that occurred on Tuesday 9 August in the Folkestone movement.
All of the products concerned have been withdrawn from the sale.
This is how you defend against armed attack with Krav Self
The world is full of dangers, but this video found at Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Major Rhon Mizrach of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, and asked how to cope with the gun in the near vicinity of an abusive robbers or abuser.
The video shows how you can defend against the attacker according to whether the attacker approaches you from behind or from behind.
If the attacker approaches behind, the first one must turn around to see the attacker and get out of the shooting line, Mizrachi says.
After that, hold the gun so that it will remain between your elbow and shoulder arm, and strike the attacker into your face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker on the knee into the groves, and when he goes to the pain of the double layer, hit him on the face with the gun barrel, and reverse by holding the gun on him.
The technique is equivalent if the armed attacker approaches the front. You need to move away from the shooting line, seize the gun and twist it so that the attacker can't fire.
At the same time, put your weight on the weapon and strike the attacker with his fists into the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker’s grasp, retreat, and hold the gun against the targeted attacker.
Does it sound difficult?
Watch the video how Mizrach does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get rid of the robbers is by giving up your cash – unless you're a Krav Magal major.
World Traveler Ian Wright arrows the dirtiest places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and colossal reflex on a hard trial by licking the dirtiest and most hostile places in Europe.
Suffolkian runner and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove their resistance to strength by licking euro banknotes, handrail Piccadilly Circus, train toilet seal and Russian general phone.
Before licking Wright measured the objects on a snow meter to see itself and show the viewers to which they were forbidden to push.
The experiment was conducted with a documentary film Ian Wright, following the inner force, and its results surprised.
The idea of licking the funnel of the train toilet can be devastating, but in fact, more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his journey to Europe at different angles Wright challenges doctors and other medical professionals for the determination of good bacteria in the intestine and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he licked caused anything but a mouth of bad taste.
Ian Wright was originally known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
No doubt the licking of the rail armchairs and the toilet seals challenged Wright’s resistance.
Wright says in the document: “I’ve been quite careless about my health ever since I was a child, and I put in my mouth all sorts of things like dirt, worms, and whores.
In the film, he actually showed himself to be taxed.
The border was only received in a gross public bathroom in Russia.
The snow meter measured more than 4000 units of the sample.
For comparisons, it should be noted that the number is usually less than 60 in the respondent hands.
The border came in the Russian public bathroom, where Wright refused to lick when the snow meter measured 4000 units – in contrast hands the same number is less than 60.
Wright adventures together with Valio in a documentary film Ian Wright – on the trail of internal force, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document: “This is almost the smell of the worst thing I have smelled in any bathroom.
4,000 units! Nothing is more dirty than that!
It's so disgusting that I'm not really licking around here.
Wright produced the documentary Ian Wright – following the inner force in cooperation with Valio.
A selection of Wright received the Valio Gefilus containing lactic bacteria and vitamin C and vitamin D, which helps to strengthen the good bacteriology and resistance of the intestine.
Niko Vuorenmaa, head of the category of menu snack, juice and novelty products, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time tell us about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and finally we ended up asking Ia...
Health has become a global trend.
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a broader context and tell us about the good and bad bacteria of our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
Global health has become a global trend, and with the help of the document we can give consumers more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells us about our sense of humor.
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s say that I had lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain of the items we’ve asked for, such as a Russian bathroom, which is also displayed in the film.
Of course, the licking of some objects was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows on the tape.
In the 2015 survey, 84% of respondents included lactic bacteria in particular the well-being of the stomach and intestine, and 58% reported that they used at least occasionally products with added lactic bacteria.
The family destroyed a rental house owned by the city in Saltashi, Cornwall
The emergency family left 50 000 pounds of damage to the city’s rental house after they had received a wedding for the terroristisation of the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldo and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been forced from their apartment in Cornwall in Saltashi after numerous complaints against the couple.
When the couple had been forced to leave the apartment, the representatives of the rental housing company noted that the apartment was shocked to be in repair condition.
The walls had large holes, floor trucks had been torn off, the garbage had been spread to the floors, and the walls had been suffocated with graffiti.
The couple has now changed, and they are believed to live in private housing.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing Agency (Cornwall Houston), says that he is afraid that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says: “This has been a full nightmare for people living here, no one should have to tolerate this.
There is much to be weighed about, as the property will probably become known not so pleasant as part of Cornwall.
The family is bad, like its name.
There were three boys who lived in the apartment at times. According to the police, the family had to practice the fear of being surrounded by street fights on baseball, the fear of the locals, the use and transmission of drugs, and loud-speaking, controversy and curses.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease agreement, received a decree on non-social behaviour in June.
There were old wastes found in several rooms of the house below the flood threat.
The house had previously sold drugs, and the floor trucks had been torn off.
Neighbors said the family was fighting on the street and the police were forced to call.
Cornwall's home office was forced by the couple this week after giving them 11 weeks of additional time to voluntarily move away.
The wounded neighbors were grateful for the wedding – they said their life was a hell of a country.
One of the neighbors said, “They didn’t care about anyone.
We've been living next to them for 20 years, and that whole time has been hard.
The police have been here many times.
This morning, we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet, and we're not used to it!
It's gonna be great now that they're finally married.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the head of the Cornwall Housing Agency for forced execution, says that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were called on a regular basis.
The garbage and old toys were thrown on the wild wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: “It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her own and his family’s behavior, as the extermination is always the last measure considered by the Cornwall Housing Agency.
This case was very difficult, because the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, to Devon and Cornwall police and to the members of the community who participated in the work and offered to provide us with information.
I hope that this step will improve the well-being of the neighbours and give a message that non-social behaviour is not accepted.
Fitzpatrick says that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in the 20s.
A dirty mattress found in one bedroom after the wedding
Housing workers now need to clean out the waste boxes around the house.
In 2014, the police made a raid and found more than 70 grams of cannabis and in addition to clothing and other supplies, as well as £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when he was found guilty of possession of a class B drug to sell it.
He claimed the money was in his car accident in 2013 for his dead son Lee Skeldon's gravestone.
After becoming homeless, Skellodon and his husband have been heard of moving to a private residence in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were covered with graffiti.
Police say they demand a wedding for tenants who violate the rules on rental contracts.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police say this wedding is a clear warning for tenants who are constantly threatening the rules.
“This is a clear message for those who think they can behave how they want without accusations, as well as for those who have to suffer from such behavior,” Crow said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and non-social behavior, and will continue to cooperate with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flyed, beached army jet was afraid of tourists in Portugal
The sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in the Averio of Portugal.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force has been hackingly low.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows a moment when tourists were forced to escape when a low-flyed jet hit the whole beach.
Dramatic images show how the army plane will almost reach the touch distance from the sun-catching tourists on the sandy beach in the North Portugal Avero.
Holidayers got up on their feet when they were worried about the jet engine’s jylin, which began to be heard before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred last afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the pictures and videos of vacationers in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says: “It passed the beach twice very low, and there was a time when it looked like it was going to fall into the country.
“I was surfing and I was sure the machine would fall on me.
Tourists on the shore of Aveiro experienced a shock when the plane suddenly came to view and flew at a dazzling low altitude.
Portugal's Air Forces have today announced that the P-3C Orion aircraft was a training flight designed to identify coastal fishing vessels, so that the aircraft had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires damaged the visibility, but the air force said that this did not threaten anyone’s safety.
Forest fires have caused destruction in parts of the continental Portugal and killed four people on Madeira's island.
Today, the Portuguese Air Forces announced that due to the bad visibility of the heavy fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight in which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Exote's first half result better than expected
The Southern Karelia Social and Health District (Exote) made a better result of EUR 3.4 million in June.
The result of the Exote was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to eradicate institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
Exote aims to reduce the number of measures this year.
Exotic covers the surplus of the previously generated deficit.
The proportion that remains above it may be used to reduce queues and buy measures for patients.
The annual result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exote Government will discuss the mid-term review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special limiters swore in Immola
Of the 70 vice presidents of the Border and Marine Guard School, they swore a military light on Friday.
The military lighting of the Border and Marine Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10 special border icebreaking courses were held at the reserve sports field.
The soldier swore 70 backup men.
Special limiters are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were applied for as a special limiter.
Some of them were called 250.
Special limiters have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the border forces of the war were involved in the occasion of the valuing.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans involved in the event were born in 1918.
A limited crime ahead - criminal intelligence helps to investigate crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland's 11 police agencies has been operating an RTA-i.e. criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible.
There are four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is drawn by Lahti's ranked superior.
The Chief Executive is working in Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian person dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everybody works in a civilian outfit.
The unit has demonstrated its suitability and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides other police officers with different reports.
In trouble, it has, among other things, obtained information about asylum seekers.
The latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim is to prevent crimes, i.e. to let the police go more and less, until they get the alarm.
The information collected and analyzed by the unit will be used to target daily police activities where it is most needed.
A criminal intelligence centre, less than three national units, and each police department’s own criminal intelligence unit were set up in the country along with the reform of police.
The PTR Centre in Vantaa’s Central Crime Police shall conduct its operations nationally.
PTR units work according to their name from police, Customs, and Border Guard.
The RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas distributed according to the police authorities, and their task is to provide information to both local police and national units.
The survey extends beyond its territory.
Where a single police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on throughout the police station.
It also extends beyond the limits of its own institution, because it also does crime.
People working in RTA units have better basic police skills.
The unit strives to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals, or similar crimes through the use of registry, alert mission databases and observations.
This is called serialisation, and it is one of the most important criminal intelligence tools.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it was honest or criminal.
On the basis of an action, the author forms a certain kind of image.
It may be done on the basis of an act or person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals Learn About Their Mistakes
The workers of the RTA unit are not able to carry the collars in the city, but their work is not entirely public.
Both their own and the methods used by criminals are not reported because it could lead to professional offenders developing their activities and thus trying to prevent police anti-criminal companies.
The police will publicly tell us if they are expected to pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, news of the early summer, the way in which empty apartments were used in housing fractures.
In it, the authors put the apartment in the outer door of the stick, a double needle, or a tape of tape where they tested whether the residents were really traveling.
The preliminary examination material shall be made public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The smartest ones are ordering a district court protocol, which may, for example, indicate that fingerprints have been found on the site.
Next time, we're going to go to the cops' hands.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppa of Hämee Police, Lieutenant General Tuimo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Department, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Inspector, Mr. Marco Tumela from the Central Crime Police.
The police will collect and analyze information that will help to plan practical action.
Based on a reduction in labour and financial volumes.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last change was a three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of your institution and Finland.
A London school girl who joined her father died in Syria.
The news shows that one of the three British students who joined Isis last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee tells the girl's family that Sultana died a few weeks ago in Raqqa, Syria.
He was believed to have been killed by the Russians in an air attack in Raqqa, which is an Isis base in Syria, said ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she was just planning to flee a war-storing country and return to Britain.
“You can only hope that this will act as a warning example and testament to make people realize this is a real risk when you go to the war zone and make people give up the decision to leave,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other East London schoolgirls, went to Turkey on a plane and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an Isis fighter in Syria and remained a widow just a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton supports Garland's appointment in the Supreme Court if he is elected
Senator Harry Reid says he is convinced that the candidate for President Hillary Clinton is named Merrick Garland's Supreme Court judge if he is elected president.
Senate Republican delegates have not agreed to confirm Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnel, the next president will elect a person to meet the seat of Antonin Scalia, the late Supreme Court judge.
Reid said in a phone conference on Thursday that he predicted Clinton's election to Garland with great certainty.
Reid's messenger later stated that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly with Clinton, whether this was going to be called Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to stop the boat by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Supreme Court of the United States Court of Appeal in the district of Columbia.
Reid says the Republicans that block Garland's name are the candidates for President Donald Trump's Villages and Advisers.
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
According to the Treats magazine, sub-director calendars belong to women as well as men.
The Treasures magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere and brings on the market the calendar of the 1970s style inspired by Pirell for 2017.
Instead of a public secret model, they want to find the next generation of top models of their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
The CEO of Treats, Steve Shaw, told me earlier this year that his nakedness was different from the old school’s Playboy magazines, because he said, “Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this for women.
He seems to think of the calendar as well.
“We need to bring back a timeless and classic nudity in which women, wherever men, can enjoy and inspire these pictures of the women’s club,” says Shaw’s calendar press release.
Women will definitely want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art.
As a model for calendar, you can send your photos through the network or participate in open selection events held in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl's charm: Who buys records?
Private, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write a comment on your angry protest with the name label EväAllEgypistKeski-aged Man, this claim is based on real research data.
According to YouGov, behind the new arrival of a lot of vinyl plates, the millennial generation is not a boom when the millennials want to feel the physical object in their hands, but instead the background is the middle-age nostalgia.
The age of a person who recently bought a vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, between 18 and 24 age groups are the least likely buyers.
It is also not just an amateur’s desire to hug discs, but the significance is emotional: older wineboard buyers are a little more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy their loneliness (69% vs. 66%).
But do YouGov's results keep it true?
If this blog had been a television news broadcast, the camera would follow me in my walk along a lively Soho Street, wearing a gray jacket of jewelry on me. I'd live hard, bending my hand into a cup and saying something about the traditions, like, \"Let's find out,\"
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and rososity when hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over prior to private entrepreneurs, there is still a handful of special record stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I am looking very close to the men visiting these stores and trying to evaluate their age and nature.
Glasgow’s Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (at the moment two young women, three middle-aged men) at the Reccless Records (at the moment, eight middle-aged men, one probably two-year-old woman) are on a meeting trip to London for the afternoon and spends extra time by exploring the offer of shops.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
I think I am, he says.
“I have about 3000 to 4000 records.
These records fill his living room wall, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me a picture by e-mail, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired so many albums and singles is partly in his available incomes. He is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared in the beginning and buy again things that he was young and moneyless to sell.
“A lot of things from the late 60s and the early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to get them,” he said.
He agrees that the purchases of vinyl plates are more likely to be introverts that are comfortable with his own company, and adds: “I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much.
It's my bad-
Wez, who works in Sister Ray, 25, also believes that many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new kind of human flow that has been affected by media hygiene. These people have heard about the arrival of vinyl plates again and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
“On the basis of my own discussions, people had generally abandoned their collections in 1998 or 1999 places.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their vinyl back, he says.
This can explain a certain-age vinyl fragrant boom.
What about the alleged emotional importance of audio discs?
In just a few seconds, the Phonica movement realizes that they offer a comforting community for similar types.
According to Wez, some of the older customers are particularly upset with an uncontested payment system.
The digital world may be dazzling some of the vinyl fans, to whom returning to familiar disks means perseverance and reminds us of the happiness of youth.
“I think it’s sometimes filled with a hole or material property for some kind of comfort,” said Wez.
I saw it as a collector myself, and I believe so many others.
It's an easy way to get ideas elsewhere.
“We’re like social workers – we’re behind the Wez workman’s record.
The ICM poll conducted in April revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought the vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their records.
The opinion poll also reported that 41% of the record player they never use is a record player, and 7% of the vinyl record buyers have no own record player at all.
At this point, the news broadcast would probably look like a serious face while a stacked bossa nova collection.
The new arrival of vinyl plates is also accompanied by a “pocalyptic phenomenon” found by the Sounds of the Universe (the customer at the moment by three middle-aged men) seller Jonny, 42.
“One client recently came out and said he didn’t have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead disc so he can put it in his shelves,” Jonny says.
“The proportion of such customers is not high, but they do.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our customers tell us they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly teenagers who are just beginning a hobby.
The customer base is much more diverse in Fopp, where I arrive next. The company has owned a whole floor on vinyl plates.
Customers include seven-year-old couples, photos of tourists, teens boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers delights, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous movements: instead of playing the game, the latest sex of Wild Beasts is a synthetic poppy.
None of the customers look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to find a pale psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes and have been watching discs in a variety of lowlands.
He's rather watching than shopping.
He says his income is small, so it is not possible to collect records for him.
They cost a lot.
It’s easy to listen to music from a computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the violin is ..., he lets a lovely glories and continues:
I can't explain, they're so unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired the generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who would think of jumping jeans, but instead gather around Polaroid cameras for a moment. I see a father and daughter thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left, there is a portal filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the main albums to any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, maybe because they're just a decorator and some are so high that they're not even promoted.
They're pure-art vinyl.
But given that all the ways to get attention to these discs may mean more money to the industry and send a few customers to search for Sohoo, there is hardly any point in complaining.
It is no surprise that the population, most likely with more time and money than most, is also the group that spends the most money on luxury, such as vinyl plates.
Although based on my research, youGov’s results are true, at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely stuck in school or working life.
They will certainly not spend Thursday mornings manifesting in Berwick Street's record stores, browsing records, and avoiding the 30-year-old television runners who look frighteningly and blinking at the uninhabited middle-aged men.
Holker, or ice shark, is the longest living vertebrate – video report
According to researchers, the longest living vertebrate on Earth is the ice shark.
According to Hai researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was age-old in the study 272-12 years, which was a five-metre female in length.
The French court rejected the application for the liquidation of the jungle camp shops
The French court has rejected the application of the Calais authorities, in which they demand the dismantling of tens of temporary shops and restaurants by the residence of thousands of refugees in the jungle camp.
In the course of the legal proceedings held this week, the Calais authorities made claims that the state should have the right to break 72 temporary trades in refugee camps. Trades sell different goods to refugee camp residents from tobacco to energy drinks and offer haircuts. Temporary restaurants can buy tea by 50 cents or basic meals by a few euros.
According to Calais Prefectors, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and are accompanied by fire and hygiene.
The humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential for the camp, because the free meals provided by the state-backed organisation and other bodies are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary stores and restaurants often provide protection and free food for those who need it.
The Lillen Court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expropriation of 72 temporary traders, but considered the prefect of Calais to be fully understandable.
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, camp’s food stores, cafes and restaurants are much more important than just to provide food to people who live in extremely unstable conditions.
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places below the landing threat was the Jungle Book Kids café, which is unprofitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice to hundreds of underprivileged minors with the most vulnerable status.
Over 170,000 people have signed an address where children’s cafes are required to be preserved.
According to a letter sent to Guardian, its closure would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimate on Friday that the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record of more than 9,000 people after a sharp increase in the number of firefighters in the summer.
Food prices in Finland are clearly lower than on average in the EU
In Finland, food is very cheap for consumers and for producers.
The price of food in Finland has decreased by almost five per cent in three years, while the average price of food in EU countries decreased by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one percent more expensive.
Over the last three years, food prices have fallen to the second most in Finland from the EU countries with a similar level of wages than in Finland.
Only in the UK, the price of food has decreased faster than in Finland.
The information is reflected in Ilkka Lehtiinen, the Director of Development of Statistics Finland, which was published in the Information & Trends blog.
The paper compared real prices, i.e. prices related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose strongly.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price of what came with the EU membership,” Lehtinen said.
Then followed the translation, after which the food has become cheaper every year.
Now, the price is heavy on the import bans imposed by Russia, which have forced food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of dairy and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and the agricultural producer prices have fallen.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
The tightened price competition in industry and trade has also affected the fall in price.
The large trade chains of the S-Group and Kesko have both dropped their prices.
The price competition for consumers has been shown to be visible as promotional campaigns.
Finland still does not have low levels of food, although the price of food has decreased significantly.
In 2015, food in Finland was the fourth most expensive of the EU countries with a level of wages similar to that in Finland.
According to the journal, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the analogue countries had the same VAT rate, the most cheap food would be sold in Finland from countries similar to the same level of wages.
The paper compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands.
If VAT rates were seven in the analogue countries, only German and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
\"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries at the price of food, VAT must be halved to the average level of EU countries and continue to compete,\" Lehtinen wrote.
The letter notes that the calculation made by him by the rate of VAT is indicative.
School is no longer the same.
A return to school may show that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide to all Finnish schools.
The schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of beauty is abandoned, and instead, schools begin to practice the codem.
Sweden’s education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and social learning begins in the fourth quarter.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of students.
It was thought that the teacher teaches the students, but now everyone needs to be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest vertebrate found - ice sharks can live for up to 400 years
The ice cream known as Greenlandn shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches maturity only at the age of 150.
It can then live for another 250 years, report a new study.
The figures make the species the longest vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal, it will only be passed by an infant in Iceland, whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507.
Greenland is swimming along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females stretch dogs longer, they can grow up to five meters.
Because the rate of growth is slow, according to follow-up, only about a centimetre per year, adult individuals have been living hard for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He defined the age of 28 of the adult ice sharks, which had remained in the fishing gear of fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed from the radiocarbonation of the eyelids.
The mean age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fishes in the sample, 493- and 502-cented amasonics, revealed about 335 and 392-year-olds.
Since previous studies have found that ice creams only reach sexual maturity at more than four meters, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years of age at that point.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann is fired for almost 300 - no vendors are reduced
Nearly 300 employees are fired from Stockman.
The company in difficulty ended in the beginning of August.
“As a result of the negotiations, around 300 jobs are reduced, the main part of which is carried out as dismissals, Stockmann says.
The number of vendors in the goods sector is not reduced so that the customer service does not suffer.
In addition, around 80 employees of support activities will be offered a new job as a seller.
Stockmann's yr negotiations concerned around 3,000 employees.
They were estimated to be around 380 employees at the start of their reduction.
The reduction of the population aims at annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are expected to be achieved in the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve the savings of €50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties are to make the store profitable.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the trade in goods still loses.
Stockmann’s CEO, Lauri Veijalainen, said sales in department stores have not reached the company’s goals.
Unfortunately, the reduction of the population is necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail’s positive operating result in 2018-2018, Veijalainen says in the statement.
The result improvement of the second quarter was particularly due to Lindex’s good success in the clothing chain.
Ketju achieved the best in the second quarter of all time’s turnover and result.
Lindex's operating profit grew by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s operating profit was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales of this year will decrease last year.
It is expected that the correct operating result will be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature less than 20 degrees in the whole country
The low pressure centre in the north of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, a meteorologist from HS.
There will also be rainfalls in the middle of the country, but the southwest is from the north.
The temperature is no longer very summer, for the whole country is less than 20 degrees of mercury.
The northern rainy areas remain at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya’s general sports team shakes doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach’s pace
John Anzrah, a Kenyan general sports coach, was sent home from Rio Olympics after it appeared that Anzrah appeared as a national athlete in Dopingtest.
The news agency AP said that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is a 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenyan National Team, reported that Anzrah’s identity was revealed after he had given a sample of Rotichina in a surprise test.
Doping officials were reporting to the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he committed a crime against the Kenyan national team.
He appeared as an athlete, gave urine samples and even signed documents.
We cannot accept such use, in turn, by Kip Keino, chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, the news agency Reuters.
The Olympics’ overall sport begins on Friday, and Rotich is expected to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was ranked in the World Championships last year for the fourth and has pre-winning Rio winner recommendations.
According to Reuters, the source inside the Kenyan general sports team claimed that Anzrah only went to the athlete’s accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When the anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was a athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid of being exposed, the source told me.
Where's everybody?
Rio General Sports Stadium
Where is everybody?
At the Rio Olympic Stadium, they don’t follow a public sport.
On Friday, the fight began in Rio, but the world’s top teams were able to present their skills to a confusing, empty audience.
On Friday, Rio said that only 58 percent of the first day’s morning tickets and 65 percent of the night’s tickets were sold.
It was four years ago in London, where the stadium had been bullied by a cheering force.
The final tickets are already sold in Rio.
The Rio Olympics’ audience has attracted attention before the public sport.
For example, in the views of rugby, melody and horse riding, thousands of empty trucks have been seen.
When Brazil's medals Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacaban, only 70% of the audience was full.
After Brazil, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the 12,000 people looked at it.
The bad goings at least explain that Brazil, struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian competitions, and many of the Olympics are weird for the Brazilians who are accustomed to football.
Even the first game of the Brazilian football team was not allowed to pull the football stadium full.
In the weekend Mario Andrada announced that 82% of tickets had been sold, which is clearly less than four years ago.
“We still have 1.1 million left to sell,” said Reuters.
Of the 8,5 million London Olympics tickets, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost nearly half more than Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not yet allowed, because organisers need money and try to get tickets for sale until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organisers have given 240 000 tickets to less-known species such as golf and rugby to school children.
At Rio Stadium, empty places were enough in the morning.
Even the beach volleyball Copacaba's sand has not been interested in the audience.
Jukka Central Hall competed in London in 2012.
The people on the leaves were enough.
New way to protect nature - Get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in the conservation of nature by the latest means.
The Foundation established last year acquires its ownership of ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private, companies and entities may, by means of money, redeem ownership rights to the land.
The foundation has acquired its first land area from Lapland.
The land area is divided virtually into blocks that the willing ones can obtain against the payment of the right of ownership.
The holder receives a right of veto of 187 square blocks, which means in practice that no approval of each holder is required if the use of the land area is intended to be changed.
You can also obtain the right to hold a number of blocks.
The acquisition of the right of administration is something concrete that can be left to your inheritance or give as a gift.
You don't have to go to carry the banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature, and Juha Levviakangas, who acquired his right to control.
The right-holder receives accurate location information in his or her area, allowing for example in the area of the visit.
On the website of the Foundation, the names of the holders of the rights of ownership are shown on the same map, where the data on the land area are found.
Levikagas sees the risk of its natural protection supply only that the Foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would operate in some way in an ethical or commercial way, but should not be possible.
The foundation of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is the protection of nature areas so that they can be intact and in peace.
The foundation acquires land areas either by purchasing or offering donations.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the foundation has acquired its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also targets outside the Finnish borders and plans to be imported from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Wheel thieves torture the big cities, worst of all Turkey - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves are the worst in Turkey from large cities in Finland.
This year, there are more bikes stolen in proportion to the number of inhabitants than in nine other major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat reported to the police on the basis of bicycle theft, the extent to which the ten largest cities have stolen bicycles in January-August this year and their parts per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose.
According to police records, four to five bike thefts per thousand inhabitants took place.
In Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bike thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
“In other cities, double theft is carried out in proportion to the number of residents, compared to others, according to police officer Tommi Reen.
Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more spins have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have a response to that.
“The generality of the maps can be influenced by how much the city is moving on the wheels and how much the wheels are in the top, thinking over-consistant Teemu Kähäs.
Tommi Reen, the police government, looks forward to having Turku, Helsinki and Oulu rise at the top of the comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to what are study and cycling cities.
Turku has a tight center, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a very different type of city where urban centres are distant and the bike is not necessarily the primary means of movement,” Reen says.
In all of Finland, police information has become slightly less bike theft than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no cause for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police will know a little more than 20,000 bike thefts a year.
It means 50-60 clusters every day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 bikes per year.
\"They're big amounts,\" Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more spins because only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to report a crime of theft, although less than one in ten cases reported to police will survive.
Typically, a wheelchair theft is one where the police get information about theft immediately and the thief gets caught in their blood.
“Explosions can also be found in other investigations, for example, when stolen wheels can be found in a drug case,\" Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves will be caught weekly in the course of the exercise or police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
He said that for example, the wheels are stolen from the wheelchairs, courtyards, warehouses and wheelchairs of the shopping centers, in practice everywhere they are usually kept.
Most of the individual bike models are stolen in the past years, like Jokod.
The U lock gives the wheel better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take a bike for short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen wheels end up selling, for example, via the Internet.
They will remain on the domestic market.
“At least, the police have not known that stolen wheels would go to a very foreign country,” Reen says.
The buyers of the stolen wheels are, according to the police, ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be accurate, for he may be guilty of a crime or a crime of hiding.
“The alarm clocks should be called if they sell a charity bike to their clear bottom,” Reen says.
Special Librarian Officer Severi Hirvi will always wear a colorful Nopsa for his working day in the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen, Hirvi says. “It’s never been taken, there’s been a good monk from there.
“Maybe this doesn’t attract thieves, it’s not necessarily the hipster value,” says the Helsinki-based Hirvi.
Siiri Valve, who quickly dealt with the Kiosk in the Kallio of Helsinki, locked his bike in a small U-class.
Now the wheel turns against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve closes his bike to something solid, like a wheelchair.
“There will be a lot to think about, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own, the Helsinki student says about his white bike, which the body alone cost about five hundred euros.
“All the time I hear from my friends that the wheels have been taken.
Mostly bad wheels, such dirty guys...
A bike was stolen from the guard in the inner yard of the house company a year ago.
However, the wheel had remained unlocked, so Valve could expect it to be analyzed.
Under 15 years of responsibility for his crimes?
Helsinki is testing peer teams familiar with the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer team is being tried to prevent young people from getting into the crime scene.
Initially, the experiment applies to people under the age of 15 who are now left without criminal liability.
The bloodball team is missing the first child to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer team will discuss the incident with the offender and impose sanctions.
A week later, the offender can himself join the peer team to compensate for his actions.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has come to be done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, a youth director, says that the model is not tight.
We also have other conciliation models that are used alongside each other.
“All of the young people are directed in a more responsible direction, so that not everything goes wrong with the first mistake,” Laitito says.
There is a model for the comparison team from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, young people will not be in front of the adult panel, but reflect on what happened to almost the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Palmu service designer Iikka Lovio, who followed the experiment, says that it was an abuse that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of people under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with before.
“It’s been a message that continues on the path you’ve chosen,” Lovio says.
The Vertaisvalaményat is part of the Finnish Migration Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new methods of action are offered to all who need it, not just for young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop financing Trump's campaign
Over 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential election campaign.
The letter was published in the U.S. Journal of Politico, who had received it to see the draft.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee Reince Priebus.
They want the party's money to be redirected to Congress elections instead of Trump's campaign.
“We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his indiscriminate, insatiable and record disadvantages, threaten to bring to the Democrats in these elections a voice call,” the letter states, according to the Politico.
Only directing all possible funds to Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in Trump decorative anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning presidential elections will decrease from day to day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent next week.
The signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is the Republican Andrew Weinstein, who is obviously opposed to Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from “people who want the parties to protect their majority in Congress” and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump, which are believed to have offended millions of voters.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, President Hillary Clinton announced his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be president so that the U.S. economy will go well for everyone.
\"Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy would go well for him and his friends,\" Clinton said.
Clinton's plan focuses on a massive, $275 billion five-year programme to improve the U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part by rich tax increases, in part by private money.
The construction program is a hands-on for American duunas who suffer from the transfer of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We are a builder, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he also sounded like Sanders to stress that rich people should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if the company goes from the United States to the tax, it has to pay the starting tax, Clinton said.
Today, he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“As President, I object to all trade agreements that operate against employees or wages, Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton, Clinton intended to criticise the economic program published by Republican Donald Trump on Monday that it favors only millions of dollars like this.
Trump's proposed reduction in corporate taxes, Clinton has previously called \"Trump's loopholes\".
Thursday Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded the hearers of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has left without paying, and the clothes Trump himself produces in China and Mexico.
\"If he wants to make America great again, he should start making his own products in America,\" Clinton said.
Such are Rio's viewers: The competitions have not glued Finns to the square, but the mobile app is interested in
Typically, sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have so far not reached the peak of viewers.
At the same time, the competitions have glued to the top of the squares by 12% of the population: on Tuesday night, the swimming pool was followed by 615,000 viewers from Ylen Olympics at the same time.
Because of the comparison: a month ago, the E.M.S.sports received almost 800,000 viewers at a time near TV2 and the football EM competitions were quite another million.
Most of the Olympics have so far been interested in cycling on Sunday night, and the fifth race day opened a stand that both reached the Olympics channel at once by nearly half a million viewers.
Yle Sport Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the audiences, and reminds us that the viewers are divided in Rio Olympics for the first time into several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Areena.
We are pleased with how much of the TV viewers choose the Olympics.
On the TV side, viewers share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competition to which Yle has owned the entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500 000 all the time, it is a good base.
The number of viewers is lower than in 2012 London competitions or 2008 in Beijing competitions, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large proportion of Rio races will come to the nighttime in Finland.
Another reason for a thin interest - if you consider it a thin one now - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the initial competitions, the interest would have been popping up with it.
In addition, sport is just beginning, as are other Finnish-interested species: sailing and riding.
Originally, the number of viewers has been close to the expectations.
When the sport starts, the audiences explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for racing at Apple App Store for free.
By Monday, the app was downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd say we're going to 200 000 downloads now.
“We’ll only get the numbers on the web later,” Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not worked for all users.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come and the mistakes have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been accompanied by a delay and another small technical problem in the early stages.
Updated versions of applications have been made to correct errors.
Rio Olympics appear on Yle channels and arenas more widely than any other sports event ever before.
Yle Fem can track some species, and on the radio, Yle Pele will pass the races every day.
The Olympics are not only working animals to Yle ever, but also the last ones that can be followed only by Yle channels.
Since 2018, Olympic sports will be displayed on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is your Sun, which has a depth of 95.3 meters on the cross.
It may be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical diver, found a 20 square meters heavy on the cross, with a depth of 104 meters on the bottom.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency attempted to confirm the observation by escalating.
The method may not be able to find a small depth of 100 meters, says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
The official depth is therefore still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Inari Lake (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
More than 80 metres from the island, Toiseves and Lakes.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
In particular, the base of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
“There might well be unknown depths, Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
In view of this, your Sun does not reach the ten deepest groups, and the Suvasvez water is still further from the top.
On August 12, at 2.29 p.m., the last piece corrected, where the deepest lakes from the middle depth were wrong.
Ignition of the Tax: Taxation of the Pensions is still more intense
The taxation of pensioners is still more severe than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the impoverishment came under the parliamentary elections and that the tax on pensioners was promised to be equal to the payees.
This is not included in the presentation of the Government.
We think that should definitely be it.
The promises made should be followed after the election, he says to the media of the West.
At the beginning of this year, employees received income reductions which reduced taxation.
In the Parliament, the matter grew up with opposition representatives who silenced the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (co.) on the electoral promises.
Purchase power is secure, it does not grow
According to the Minister of Finance Petteri Orpon (Kok.), the tax cuts are mainly about securing and increasing purchasing power, because no wages will be increased next year.
He says that tax reduction has a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase the uncertainty of people.
Ihalainen welcomes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centred) and Orpo’s messages about the desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached with effort.
He says that holding the deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy of the government.
It has been done with the power of the social partners, so it should not be challenged.
It comes to the need because the economy has so much in place of domestic demand and people’s own belief in the future.
Long-term unemployment
It calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget line, at least to stop its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was about 17,000 more than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's goal of raising the employment rate to 72% is to run away.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there is a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims in Thailand's attacks
At least four people died in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The Embassy calls on Finnish people in the country to be alerted and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
It is not necessary to cancel your trip to Thailand due to explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the Embassy on caution, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The travel period in Thailand is scheduled for the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand on Facebook after bombing.
In particular, the Embassy has tried to target Finns in Hua Hin to learn about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are now out of town.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, there is no information yet about the cause of the attacks.
The Ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest of a divided society in Thailand and to the last week's referendum on the constitution of a military train.
The law was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country were arrested who said they were opposed to the law.
In the southernmost parts of Thailand, the ethnic conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today there is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, says Westphalen.
He said the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Transport in the city is very little.
The shocks seem to be in the course of the day so that the authorities are very precise about safety.
Thailand Police: The attacks are not about international terrorism.
According to the police, the attacks are a local sabotage and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also excluded, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day, when 11 bombs have exploded around the country, such as tourists' favorites in Phuket and Hua Hin.
In Finland’s most popular tourist destination, the resort in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, according to Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require death victims.
Two bombs exploded in the city, according to the magazine, at Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the magazine.
According to local authorities, four bombs have exploded yesterday and today.
In both double bombings, at least one died.
In addition, in South Thailand, the Surat Than village and the City of Trang exploded at least one bomb.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Tani is also familiar with many tourists, as it is used to travel to the resorts of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The factor in the attack is not known
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the military train that controls Thailand, the attack is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn’t panic more people, he said to reporters.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the purpose of the factors was to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks had occurred in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on Finnish people in the country to be alerted and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
In Thailand, it is not necessary to cancel your trip because of explosions, but it is worth noting the instructions on caution, says Westphalen.
In injured Europeans
There are very few attacks in Finland during the night and their victims are known so far.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has been able to get a little more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, among which there were at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's second attack.
Two bombs exploded in front of the famous bell tower.
Thai PBS says the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin from which it believes it has found another bomb.
The Surat Than bomb was hidden in a flower cap, according to the governor of the county.
A local worker died in the attack.
There is at least one injured.
CNN's police chief says that two bombs were used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded about half an hour ago.
Bangkok Post said the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles won women's four-games
The US Alexandra Raisman was the second score of 60,098 and the Russian Alija Mustafina with the third score of 58,665.
Biles, 18 is still in Rio's competition for tennis medals with permana, jump and boom.
Biles has been managing women's gymnastics to the point of view over the past few years.
From the last three years, he has eight personal world championships.
He has won the four championships and the permansion championships three times in a row, as well as the boom last and the second year.
In the US team, Biles has won two teams' world championships.
Biles have jumps and booms.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: \"The person has no impact on tourism.
Esa Huovila, a children’s playground in Phuket, is not concerned about the impact of Thailand’s bomb attacks on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don’t think there will be anything more amazing about this, it is estimated by Huovila as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen a lot of tragedy in Thailand.
There's always something here.
First was tsunami, then avian flu and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these previous tourists have not banished tourists, this is hardly the case either.
Huovila's company office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard of the attack from his own employee.
The employee called about nine local times and said he shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought that roadblocks had been placed for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at around 10:00 a.m. for local time.
On the beach, many had not even heard of attacks.
At half a day, Thailand’s time in Patong’s traffic was normalized and much of the stores had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila said.
Later, this car was seen in Kruunupy with Jouxholm.
When the police got there, the car was set to burn.
The party found two men who fit in with their senses hidden in the close six.
The other man was caught right away.
The other one ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage to the operation of the motor vehicle.
The police thank you for the tips given.
Research Director of Russian leadership changes: Clear deportation
On Friday, the highest-ranking change in leadership took place in Russia, when President Vladimir Putin separated the head of his administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is an Estonian-style 44-year-old Anton Vauno.
He's an ex-diplomate and worked as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's separation can be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from collecting too much power.
He adds that recycling of managerial tasks is one of the ways of using power.
This is a way of preventing people from gathering independent power from the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been forced into chains with other executives or mutated.
Ivanoville Station Loss
Ivanov, a member of Putin's internal borders, is transferred to the special tasks of environmental and transport matters.
With a tape presented by the state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed Vavo to replace him, said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, it is a clear loss of position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian power.
Ivanov has also played a major role in the President's Security Council.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin at KGB.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but was president of Dmitry Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that old maps, such as Governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
A senior researcher from Katri Pynnönniemi's Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin is changing his neighborhood to younger ones.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when they retreated to Syria.
They used civilians as a human shield to escape to the city of Jarabulus, so as not to target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arabs and Kurdishs managed about 90% of the city of Manbij, which is important to Isis.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists stayed in the city.
The earlier news was corrected at 19:30: In the past, we misinformed that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The Policy of the Ministry of the Interior is unlawful
The Ministry of the Interior's guidance on the publication of documents is illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of Public Law from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen tells the STT that the publication of documents cannot be based on the authority’s own guidelines, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to submit the list of participants of the Interior Minister's events to East Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision by the instructions of the Government Office and by the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Head of Communications of the Ministry tells the STT that there is a need to reform practices in the ministry.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic Show starts in Rio
As in the last few years, Bolt has run against time under the prizes.
He hurt his way back from the beginning and had to leave the Jamaican Olympics behind.
This has not been the perfect preparation, but I’m much better in shape.
I've been doing well and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
This press conference included small-scale sambatants and fans.
Porina Bolt is underlined by the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in the era of the struggle for public sports with doping scandals and lulling interest.
Bolt's previous defeat in the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he was cut off from 200 metres in the early 21.05.
At that time, the 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by the injuries and loosening of your training position.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began by a hundred meters, in which he crushed the world record and the self-confidence of competitors in a period of 9.69.
This is harder
A year later, in Berlin’s World Championships, Bolt reached his career at the end of his career at the clock.
World records born in Berlin are still valid at 9.58 hundred metres and 19.19 two hundred.
Riosa Bolt has announced that he is pursuing 200 metres of world record and 19 seconds of sublime, but no one else believes in its birth.
Satasella Bolt is the very challenger of the Ateenan 2004 Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year, in Beijing’s World Cup, Bolt lost the American in just one hundred-second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost in the finals of the prizes once if only he has reached the road.
In Daegus 2011 the World Cup of the 100th century remained without running from Bolt due to a flash start.
Bolt will fill in in a lot of weeks after 30.
He's an old man in the breed of young men, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the next year's World Championships in London.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the rest of them.
I'm older and this is harder.
But whenever I am in the lower countries, I remind myself: this year I must do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Disclosures from Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to Xinhua, China’s state news agency Chen Xinyi, 18, has given positive doping samples at Rio Olympics.
The doping sample of the Chinese swimmer Chen Xiny found traces of banned substances.
Also, the Bulgarian drink Silvia Danekov is suspected of a doping crime.
In addition, the Kenyan general sports coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given doping samples with signs of epo-hormon.
He was ranked in Rio in the fourth place in women's 100 metres of butterfly spray.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estao, the Chinese capital has taken its doping cases to the International Court of Appeal for Sport CAS.
Xinhua says that a sample given by Xiny on Sunday would have found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping episodes have also been revealed in Rio.
BBC News that Bulgarian women's drinks Silvia Danekova has given doping samples with signs of epo-hormon.
Kenya has, on the other hand, sent a sports coach from Rio home because of the doping.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK announced that the Kenyan coach had made the test as a athlete and had given a doping sample for this.
According to media data, it's a Chinese fast-track coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used a 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotichi's pass.
Phelps can't stop anything - the historical gold came in the display style
The most successful athlete in Olympia history, the United States Michael Phelps swims 200 metres in the mix of its 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympics.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve the same species of Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive races.
The Phelps won time was 1.54.66.
Japan’s Kosuke Hagino was ranked second in confusion before China’s Wang Shunia.
I'm just trying to have some fun, BBC Olympic Commander Helen Skelton laughs at a quick interview in the afternoon.
Helen Skelton (a.k.a.) on Monday is one of the most read sites this week.
Next to the commenter Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not have much stress if there is a small noise in the media or in the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is a visual media, she emphasizes.
Skelton has dressed in high-rise shoes and short dress with at least sufficient publicity - at least for the eyes of many conservative British athletes.
However, there are no back steps.
It's important to look good, and the small coffees are just a fun thing.
Skelton will surely want to scare you and maybe bother you, but he emphasizes that you don't want to be in the main role.
It's not about me, he says.
Here we are watching sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter how I dress.
Can you imagine that the coffee has reached Finland?
I can't, but all that focuses on how hard these swimmers do their work and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skellon's pushing.
You know what?
It’s a treat from scratch if it comes from wearing (the driver).
I'm having fun with a little bit if someone's been hit like this.
Rio's police have two arrests due to a terrorist attack.
On Thursday, Rio Police announced that it has arrested two people because of a terrorist attack.
Police arrested in the context of the security control of the races.
In the same context, the police made five other arrests and interviewed two persons before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, the persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group, whose members were arrested by the police in July.
The arrested are believed to have links with the ISIS.
The arrests were known to have triggered violence in social media.
The message of violence was distributed in the popular WhatsApp service, among other things.

Police blew up a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place in the audience.
The police let the public in after the package had been blown up in control.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics, when the police have performed a controlled explosion mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package.
The public got in when the police had fired the package.
The public did not record the game by the beginning, because the police closed the arena for the last time due to the suspicious package found in the smell.
The police blew up the package and released the public until after that.
The tank awakened the contests with a dream to start the Spanish team.
In two losses, Spain won the Nigerian score from 96 to 87.
In two previous races, Spain achieved silver.
The police have already performed a controlled explosion task for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Last time, the police were forced to blow up a suspicious discovery in the vicinity of the road bike in the vicinity of the destination last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty views.
Argentinian lady wears Petija-Siren - Finnish think of protest
The wind in Petaja-Siren was a colorful day of competition in Rio.
The wind in Petaja-Sire was hard on Thursday.
Argentinian lady wears Tuuli Petija-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surf day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant admitted the breach.
He got stuck because of the crash, and the others ran away, Finland’s head coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing that because it would have been unnecessary according to the Olympic rules.
I should have dropped in the water to get a refund, Petajar-Siren said.
The Finnish man hung on his desk until the last time because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnish people left their 27th place with the crash.
In the overall situation, London’s 2012 Olympic hop medalist is the eighth.
With respect to the lungs, the carb didn't seem to have much effect.
Friday is an important day when the race starts 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petajar-Siren did not make protests.
7 special things that, according to science, extend the age
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring additional years to a person’s life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life is extended.
Sometimes things that a person can’t influence can bring him additional years.
These include a tendency to middle-body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend the age.
You don't always have to collide, just apply for a milk can.
The secret of a long age has been sought to find out in many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven strange research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drink has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
The Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a reduced risk of death, especially with regard to neurological or cardiovascular diseases.
On behalf of alcohol, there are once again studies that suggest that reasonable use - one in three days - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived as parents as people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of dental tape can extend a person’s life even over six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents infection.
They can, on the other hand, contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
The research conducted in Norway found out how laughter affected human life.
Over 54,000 people looked at the project for over seven years.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when gender protection is taken into account, is good for health according to many studies.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have additional years of life, he should also receive orgasm.
Traffic will bring additional years, but it will not be contested.
However, achieving a long age does not require absolute consistency.
One study at Oxford University found that women with a big back side had lower cholesterol levels.
Their body also had more omega 3 fatty acids.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it was an actor who won the Olympics or an Oscar, he is more likely to live longer than a regular bully.
Many studies have tried to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation can be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life to life for additional years.
Some researchers suspect that a long-term age is the result of a person’s social status – which, in turn, allows the Nobel Prize, for example, to pursue such recognitions.
A study of shopping behaviour in people over 65 years of age found that a person shopping every day, probably less likely to make purchases as a parent.
This is due to the fact that in concrete stores rotation reduces loneliness.
It has also been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to death.
So let's count your credit card on your hand, so online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
Umpihuman bike driver blows towards the truck
On Friday night, a heavy truck and passenger car crane was held in Koskella.
The accident occurred in Koskella, between Koskent and Sorvastont on Friday at 21:00.
The truck had been driving towards Forssa, when the passenger car that came against me had driven to the same lane, hit the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was able to run, but burned.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car sank into the stream and then passed over to the roof.
A woman born in 1972, carrying a passenger car, remained in her car.
The rescue facility removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to the Turku University Hospital.
The result of a woman's blowout was 2.02 prom.
He's suspected of being a drunk drunk.
Posts send boxes to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in Salon K-Citymarket's lattice selection because the mail had accidentally delivered some of the load to the Seinajoki.
Teija Haltia in Perniö was on Thursday buying bulk boxes from Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit her in the eyes.
Unfortunately, the Irish have product shortcomings because Posti delivered our loads to the Seinajoki!
We get more when Posti gets the delivered load!
If there's no congestion in the lawn, the sign reads.
The shopkeeper’s sticky sign relates to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowers.
The food is offered by Post until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update hit me with an idiot.
The media’s representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention of this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday evening, the Haltia update had more than 700 divisions on Facebook.
Haltia got her favorites caught in a box of loose sheets, even though a few camps were empty.
Jaakko Kaideso, responsible for the business of Posti Company Transportation Services, regretted the damage to East Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stages went into the wrong place yesterday (Seinajoki) and we no longer went to do a partial delivery (Saloon) on three, but only took five stages today, Kaidesoo told Ilta-Sanom.
This is the first news of the evening.
Teija Haltia did not get upset about the sign because she found a selection of all her own antiques.

Wish of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the Victim for the benefit of the police dogs
A week ago, a 42-year-old woman in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered for the benefit of a police dog instead of flowers and challenges.
The Sipoon Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update that conveys the wishes of the victim’s family for the benefit of the police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoon Veterinary Centre and had also completed his nursing training there.
The medical station remembers the words that touch the woman.
Happy, smart, humorous, and unerrivaled work.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that donations will go to police dogs as a whole, primarily for the purchase of security tapes.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old holiday woman was murdered in her own backyard in Loviisa, Koskkenkylä.
The women’s neighbors have told the evening magazine the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flowers.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder did not know a woman and had no connection with each other.
The killer was traced by a police dog Börje, who was wounded in a life-threatening situation.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The Court of Justice gave Post a judgment on the violation of the Law of Equality
The Post did not have the right to arrest the salary of the employee who refused to study the temporary worker, according to Kanta-Hämeen’s judgment.
The right to pay Post’s employees most of the paid salary and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested only part of the employer’s salary, which corresponded to the proportion of the study for the whole day’s work.
According to the case law, the employee was placed in a more favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity in violation of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the ban on the establishment of the Union for Posti and Logistics (PAU).
During the Postage Act last November, PAU made a decision that Post workers would not be familiar with temporary workers who break the strike.
It was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respective development, written by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in his response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centred) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the situation of human rights in Turkey.
In his letter, Sipilä and Soini were asked to express their concerns about the freedom of speech and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini repeatedly report that Finland has brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of press and expression.
Putin fired the chief of his administration - replaces the Estonian-like Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has resigned President Sergei Ivanov, President of the Board of Presidents, the Kremlin says.
The Soviet-Viron Communist Director, Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vauno, will be present.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
It also becomes a member of the Russian Security Council, the news agency Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired the chief of his administration.
According to the Kreml report, Ivanov, a close internal circle of Putin, is moving to the special tasks of environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov had himself asked for a transfer to other tasks and suggested that Vauno be replaced, Russian Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the spying of the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov as a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: Manu's giant purchase of a game ban - not to be seen in the opening of Valoliiga
The world record man for football transfers is not seen in the field when England is kicked off for the weekend.
Paul Pogba’s ban on playing followed England.
Manchester United's giant Paul Pogba is on the side of ManU opening his league on Sunday against Bournemouth, said BBC on Friday.
ManU paid EUR 105 million for the Italian club Juventus, according to British media.
However, the British Football Association (FA) keeps him out of the game, for Pogba was left under the ban on the game.
He received two warnings from the Italian Cup last season, and it becomes a single game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told BBC.
Pogba’s next port to play is on the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
Flow's great madness is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally prestigious event, marked by the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Fester walkers have typically expressed themselves in their own clothes.
One of the main artists is punk legend Iggy Pop this year.
Flow Festival’s event area is hosted, among other things, by artificial grass and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main plate and a beer, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival, held in the Summer Gulf of Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small block festival to the events of tens of thousands of visitors.
The question behind the success is simple: What kind of event would the factors themselves want to go?
It is quite unusual to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and operate in accordance with the authority regulations, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to be sold out this year.
The goal has been to raise the number of 70,000 people in the last year with 5,000 people.
This year, a group of interesting domestic and foreign artists will be seen.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing because it has to be financed somehow.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point mass would be like a flock, which is directed at huge highways.
That's what we don't want.
Over 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been highlighted in such a way that there are 130 performers, art theaters, as well as numerous restaurants and drink bars in the partially artificial grassed area.
In addition to the main and smaller ships, this year, 15,000 people operate on tents.
Kallio admits that the event could be done more easily.
Maybe I'm a little crazy, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, it's not our case anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done by Kallio is that today, even the great visions are practically possible.
During the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the activity was highly dependent on the support of around €20,000 in the City of Helsinki.
Last year, the turnover of the stock company running Flow was around EUR 6 million.
It allows you to do some Greek things, like building a tent that is 73 meters wide.
Flow’s visitors have typically expressed themselves in their own clothes.
In addition to the music event, it is possible to talk about the trendy adult community of young people.
However, the event is not consciously profiled as a particular fashion.
We want to be separated first and foremost with content.
However, fashion phenomena are also suitable for Flow's world of value: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment,” Kallio says.
This year, one of the main artists of the main stage is the legend of the pound, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he does not have the most typical performers at the indierock, pop music, rap and solo festival.
According to Kallio, Iggy was busted because now is probably the last time we see it in the gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's being played on commercial radio.
Iggy's last album is damn good and he's been doing good gigs in the last few years.
Thailand's tourist parasitic bombs were hidden in the bouquets of flowers - tourists fled their horrors
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were hidden in a flower bag and exploded with cell phones.
Bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists began to leave bars and return to their hotels, according to the police representative Samier Yoosumra CNN.
Since 1989, the wild animal protector Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, tweeted a large-scale picture of the attacks.
If the TV doesn't look good, you can watch it from here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
The people ran against me and said that the bomb had exploded at the bar.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, told Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of injured persons is not yet known.
Two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket.
No one is known to have died.
At the same time, Hua Hin had another double bomb attack.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police reportedly found at least one bomb that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel troops behind the bomb attacks that are not satisfied with the operations of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, it may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken on the activities of criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new troops will begin the battle in a military situation.
In an acute military situation, the military forces will be ordered to battle until several months after the oath of the military light, says the Middle Finlandan.
According to Professor Jukka Sonninen, the Defence Forces Training Commander, who has been interviewed by the newspaper, for example, in a military situation of 5.5 months of service, only those who are at the end of their education are eligible for combat.
According to the Head of Education, the service is first assigned to the reserve members of the emergency staff.
No backup or reserve member shall be ordered for a task that has not been provided for the required training, Sonninen says.
In the summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces are taking up the training of the backup forces for immediate readiness units from next year.
If necessary, units may be used in military activities already during military training.
Pamela Tola received a giant compensation from the home house
The actor Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, Pauli Waroma, have won a harsh dispute about the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The trading price of a two-storey separate house was EUR 330 000.
However, after trading, there was a serious moisture problem in the house that caused a dangerous microbic growth in health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in the summer of 2014.
The sales price had fallen to 132,000 euros, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma was almost EUR 198,000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both court and court.
The court gave judgment on Wednesday.
It was in force in the District Court judgment ordering the seller to pay to Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the trial and clearing costs of the couple.
The right to a reasonable price reduction was slightly due to the fact that some of the need to repair the apartment had already been known to the buyers when it was trading in the apartment.
However, according to the court law, the apparent building errors were essentially more serious than what had been proposed.
Tola is looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had been looking for a good home because they didn’t want to do repairs.
He was given the idea that the building was under renovation and in good condition and that there was no harm to the aspects mentioned in the health check report.
The municipal inspection report referred to the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rainwater and melting water from rock learning.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it was not clear that this was a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma realized that rainwater from a rock should be driven a little over a few years.
The goods were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the watering problems of the apartment were much more serious.
In the 2012 and 2013 inspections, the building found microbic growth rates due to both rock rainfall and capillarally rising land pollution.
According to the inspector, air contaminated by microbes in the west, could also enter the interior through the fibre.
Healthy risk-friendly, limit values across the mold or yeast were found in the brush samples in the homeroom, in the basement staircase, in the living room window box, and in the basement laundry room.
Steels built without permits
The law also contested whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the city of Espoo before the transaction, according to which the illegal changes had been made to the apartment.
Among other things, the terraces were built, although there were no appropriate permits.
Home problems were, however, a key issue in court.
According to the court law, buyers could assume from the seller on the basis of the information they had received before the sale that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for the measuring repairs in the near future.
In Tola and Waroma, there was no special reason to carry out a more conventional inspection.
The buyers have not neglected their reporting obligations, according to the court’s judgment.
Rough stocking: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to the Nazis - also in the register of Finns
The journalist Christopher Andersson wrote in his recent article on Dagens Nyheter, how the U.S. National Archives, Maryland, has documents stored on microfilms, covering a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are German, but also American, French, Dutch and Russian are involved.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be a Nazi musician.
The documents and registration cards are from the Nazi-German breed agency.
The breed agency operated under the leadership of the SS under Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true for women who had to be able to give up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were conducted for women to investigate the matter.
The Breeding Office examined women’s backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
The goal was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to provide life-cycles and good recommendations from close relatives.
The Bureau wanted to guarantee that women were “loved” and “saving” and “good national socialists” who knew very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as a bride of SS men.
The case does not tell us how 14 Finnish women found in the archives were.
SS leaders created a state-backed program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program ordered that each SSman should have four children, either in marriage or outside it.
Lebensborn homes care for children born outside of marriage and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the U.S. Holocaust Museum pages.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The German mother’s honoraryist was given to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between the Aryans, and non-Aryans were prohibited by law, the museum’s pages state.
The 6th of Petajar Sire, the Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was ranked third of the sailing at the first departure of Finnjolle Day at Rio Olympics, but remained the whole group of tails for the second day to leave.
The Nircko rose eight times after five exits, but the failure of the second exit dropped him in position 14.
Wind Petajar-Sire fought for RS:X class day departures in 17 and 3.
In the overall situation, Petaja-Siren is the sixth.
In the 470s, Jonas and Niklas Lindgren stayed at the opening of the day.
Lindgrens are ranked 19.
Jari Sillanpää's satulinna was recorded at a couple of hours' nights ago: \"I was so in a cloth.
Jari Sillanpää has been part of Finnish favorite artists for more than 20 years.
From the cruise ship’s barmaid to the 1995 tango queen, Finland’s best-selling soloist, and the Sillanpää, as a star of dance festivals and painters, continued to filth, and is currently in a shady boost.
A book written by Mari Koppes, about the life of a favorite singer, Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana was released on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
The career of Sillanpää rose to a full rise in his victory in the Tango market of the crown of the Tango River in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had written to Sillanpää, at the request of a man, a piece of tango, which was adapted by Kassu Halonen to a slightly different form.
The song satulinna became one of the most popular songs in the history of Finnish music.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly according to the plans: Sillanpää sang it on the tape in a terrible collar and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so dressed!
Sillanpää remembers in the book.
It would not immediately be thought that it was sung in a hangover.
Although I wasn’t physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that it is not always necessary to demand the perfect and the top.
One of the most popular songs of a man, the book says, happened nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then partner, and the case ended up earning gold, which was published as singles in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Saara Kohäs were not the same as Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record, telling a story about his own life, but the words of the song about the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the 7-day news.
In the news of the magazine, the reason for the difference between Jar and the ex-loved one was the excessive celebration and alcohol use of Jar, but Jar said it was a full pop and not true.
She called the book and refused to sing the song, but finally ended up singing it, and good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the voting week’s opinion polls anticipate the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institution or university flagged the difference, although a couple of individual researchers might disagree with the mainstream power of their profession.
On the basis of Western politics, the former US President Bill Clinton’s upcoming election campaign, “It’s the economy, the studios – flew to the wreck in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic Kihara
The Centre for Macroeconomics takes the most recent month's survey of professional responses to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the loss of the economic position of economists is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of jobs, almost standard.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the right UK.
Many people also have the idea that a reduction in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the economists, voters did not believe in economic arguments because the consensus of the economists did not come up sufficiently.
In particular, the BBC's equality was reduced, which provided as much room for only a few per cent of EU economists who benefit from economic differences in economics as the overwhelming majority.
The EU's hate press was not interested in telling us what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE are about the consequences of the gap.
These far-reaching letters spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the economist’s messages were both listened and understood, they were not transmitted because the economists represent an elite with whom voters do not think they have common interests.
The academics of major cities such as economists would have remained in the EU, but the message was not effective in small cities and rural areas.
Immigration is also an economy.
The overwhelming victory argument for the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrant takes your job, the immigrationer rushes your hospital, the migrant uses you for good.
These arguments did.
Every cafe has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre has a waiting room for immigrants.
How much easier would the British get doctors if they weren’t?
There are also children of immigrants in each school.
How much easier would it be for the children of the right British to get out of school?
Every municipality is home to foreigners.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
These relate to jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them, and if they succeeded, their answers did not become visible.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, Britain has even more jobs, less health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and in particular EU immigrants - are the net taxpayers of the British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund was reserved for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, the property of which is the Finnish Pertti Olden.
In Aberdeen, he said, early Brexit was prepared for the A and B plans.
Plan B, i.e. the winning of an EU-sponsored camp, began to be prepared for more details a few weeks before the vote in case the result would be a good one.
It took care that investors would withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have large amounts of liquid funds, but they could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on Day 23, we had 25% of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says about Aberdeen’s only open day-to-day real estate fund, which the news relates to.
According to the old people, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
At that time, the value of the fund was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is around £20 billion.
It was the highest number in the nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says all of the British real estate funds open.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was less than or equal to 10%.
So the real estate funds reserved for Brexit in different strategies.
Funds shut down trading
When the camp in favour of the EU was won, Europe went crazy.
However, the few two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were very quiet, Vanhanen says.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech of Mark Carney, the CEO of the Central Bank of England, where he estimates that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
Together, the situation was shaken and brought to the main points of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball began to spin, and the fund after each other had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it had to finally freeze its trading for six days.
According to the old ones, they did not actually close trading, but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether money should now be drawn out in panics.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it wouldn't be worth it, for it would be lost.
It calmed down the situation, and most of them cancelled the notification.
Since then, it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, the old man says.
He points out that, for example, the Aberdeen Manner-Europe funds have had no similar blows.
However, there were a lot of questions.
Unfairly paying attention to real estate funds
According to the old people, the closures of real estate funds were given an unreasonable amount of attention.
The open funds, which were covered by the closures, are dominated by about four per cent of the UK's properties.
The Aberdeen lock lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds on to half of 2017.
Currently there is uncertainty in the air, and the economic growth forecasts have been reduced, but the situation does not seem to be more important to Aberdeen.
The biggest issues are now about the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has brought some of the real estate investors even new opportunities, the old man points out.
The exchange rate of the pound and the dollar is at its lowest for 30 years, and in addition, the market has a 15% discount compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property at up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit introduced mines to the London real estate market
In the morning, the situation didn’t look like much.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, who was responsible for the real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was another.
That's the word of power.
I realized that this is going on the B side of the planet, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He went to work right away.
London City was still alive in the morning.
The television screens that were normally silent at the office made the news, and usually the loud people were silenced to listen completely when Prime Minister David Cameron came to the camera in the morning to tell the difference.
When the market opened, the screen endings flashed red only.
It was the morning that he would never believe in, the old man said.
Not because, despite the mystery, Aberdeen, one of the UK’s largest real estate funds, finished two real estate stores on the day after the Brexit vote.
The mood was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for an alternative, and that was why the situation was kind of calm,\" the old man says.
The Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
A pound collapsed, the British leader went on the switch.
The market started to expect a sharp fall in the UK and, in particular, in the London real estate market.
London office premises were expected to lose up to 20% in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the poison is broken, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
It doesn’t look like the last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He believes it is too early to say much about what is going on with Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already become the first information.
The CBRE information on price developments in the real estate service company covers about a third of the market.
According to these, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, the decline was 6.1 per cent, the old man reads.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're months of change.
The monthly index was published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All the same fall hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was compared very quickly with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate markets.
The old man believes that the comparison is not quite a hit, because it is now the UK’s domestic crisis.
The atmosphere is another.
The real estate market has not now been seen as a panic sale like that time, but a willingness to sell liquidity, says the old man.
The funding can also be found normally.
The repair could have been in front of you anyway.
In fact, the price repair business isn't a miracle about him, it could have been like this without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of properties in London and other world top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and, in particular, the offices are overrated, the old man says.
So the fall began very high.
London prices have written up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London has grown as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is globalized, the Old Man says.
In the Middle East and Asia, new players have become on the market, and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fed by low interest rates, which, for example, pension companies have been forced to search for revenues from new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been easily available - although, according to the old man, the loan has now been used clearly less than in the period before the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, disperse
In London, the rise in prices was balanced last summer, says the old man.
Aberdeen also began to reduce its ownership in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of translation to wait for, and now it came.
What's going on here?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He is not afraid to evaluate the future, but he says that there is hardly any uplift.
The feeling suggests that there is a fall or a steady passage in front of you.
The old man has seen several movements up and down since 1988, as he has been in the real estate sector.
And he's still an optimist who believes that he's going to get rid of the hole by work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in one market, there's too much of that sacrifice.
If you're scattered, the risks are also scattered, the old man says.
The S Group will start to register the purchase information in more detail
As soon as the S Group knows what you are eating, the trading group said today that it will start collecting more information about the purchases of its parent customers.
So far, when information has been collected about the final amount of the receipt, the group will begin to hesitate to do so at the beginning of May.
The S-Group comes after Kesko here, because the information on the goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in the Kesko customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Ritalan, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has mainly been positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer’s consent and used for marketing.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
Quite a few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Economics.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to the change in the registration of the S-Group.
Kesko is already classifying its carrier customers according to the food purchases in ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Kanta customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money used for them.
Data is used for customer-focused marketing.
The product-specific purchase information is collected only from the K-group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a carrier client program and this is not the case with this one.
The Finnish Middle Market has its own One-stop shop client program, which can be associated with the Electoral Houses, Siwos and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect product or product group-level information, we remain on the level of the final amount of the receipt.
So we know where the purchase was made, and that day, and the final amount of the customer’s receipt.
We have not gone to a level like the K-Group or the S-Group, says the commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, it will be planned to reform the client’s programme in the future, but the Middle Trade will tell you about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that the product information will be registered.
Initially experimenting
So far, SOK’s customer and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address data, the basic information includes professional, education, form of residence, birth years of children and previous personal data.
People in the same economy and their roles are also registered.
The S-Etu card purchase is stored on the date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of purchases and the method of payment.
In addition, information from S bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prisma, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, data is currently recorded at product group level.
Customers have been hoping for a longer time to focus more on marketing, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer and Partner Activities of SOK.
The S Group says they will inform their customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in cats in any case, wanted it or not.
Halukas can check your stored information on the S-Group website.
For example, the cashiers cannot access the data, emphasizes Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-fashion is Tulli's latest dog fixation - the prophecy becomes the first explosive dog
The black labradorinator's puppy is heavily hatched with five boxes of the same country in a row at Helsinki Airport.
It won’t take long for it to sit next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with its favorite toy.
The box next to which Heila sat revealed a jar of seals that would repel the radishing gas.
Ruuti gas is the first smell that Heila and Heila have now been practiced, says Suntio, the owner of Heila’s dog.
Security situation and online trade access
Heila is the first dog specialized in the search for weapons and explosives in Tulli and is placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also be carried to other border crossings and ports as necessary by Heila and Suntion.
However, the airport will be the main workplace of Heila, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks of Paris and Brussels were caused by measures in Customs, and after the attacks, surveillance has been confirmed, says Tullin Inspector Mikko Grönberg.
Another access to the duties of Customs for the training of weapons and explosives dogs is postal transmissions through Helsinki-Vantaa.
With an increased internet trade, up to 40 million mails pass through the airport each year, among which arms and explosives may be ordered abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made online shopping, passenger luggage and air freight at Helsinki Airport for approximately 300 weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives, as well as their precursors.
Heila will work across Helsinki.
It will investigate registered luggage and mail.
In ports it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large containers and mark areas that require more accurate research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, Customs assess whether the arms and explosives dogs will be trained to increase in the future.
Grönberg is looking forward to the idea.
School in the church
Heila-pennuu training is coordinated by the Tulli Dog School in Kirkkonumme.
Suntio also attends training with Heila with police and defense experts.
The police have strong experience in the training of dogs and in the Defence Forces with expertise in explosives.
Customs will decide, together with other authorities, what smells Heila will be taught to recognize.
Heila is always trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues in Helsinki-Vantaa are Tullin’s six drug dogs, as well as the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador's picker Heila has been chosen for 10 puppy puppies.
The selection criteria for a dog to choose at the airport include tearing and hunting, as well as peace, as the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives, and human flows.
Heila is a close friend to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing without Heila gets home, Suntio laughs.
The fine orders go to Heila from a single box.
The cameraman of the night-says will lose a camera mask to the fast dog, but Heila will return a soft toy-looking cover from the immediate-hair-hand.
Hard competition from working dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
There is still a level test ahead, the next October, where it is estimated that education will be sufficient for work tasks.
Heila can be seen at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plans.
Unfortunately, travelers cannot come to smooth the working vests of the dog on it, reminds us of Suntio.
The cost of a single working dog is around EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working age is about seven or eight years, and after which they will retire to the care of their owner.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active working hours can only last from 10 minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of working dogs is a hard competition in Customs.
Heila's owner was approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
Good luck hit Suntion who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in the Customs.
The Empire has its first Olympic medal - the people get a day off.
At Rugby, the Olympics of Fiji, with less than a million inhabitants, are valued in the country so high that the government has ordered August 22th national holiday.
According to the country's broadcasting company, Fiji's government confirmed the case after the championship was settled.
Free day is held for the team to return home the next day.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in his country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian says that the country was followed by the final in the capital city of Suva, where the stadium had been erected a screen.
Normally, only native Fijins are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encouraging, said the journalist of the Fiji Times to Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish composer passed out after the execution
Milko Tokola, a weightlifter, succeeded with his last company from 175 pounds after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature.
During or immediately after the hard rises, he has been swirled several times.
No one could really say why.
In Rio, Tokola received 175 pounds and 145 pounds.
His combined result was 320 pounds.
Tokola was trying to get his job at the end of 175 pounds, as well as in the other.
With the third company, the weights rose as a result of loud screams.
The crown was under pressure until the jury accepted the pickup.
The joy of a Finnish teacher was that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS was acquired by official artist Prosan - Veikkausliiga - East Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Club, playing in the football league of men, has concluded a sustainable contract with the Estonian athlete Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a team of top players with power and the threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
With over ten players, we went through a lot of 50 players from all over the world.
A small number began to stand out as a good alternative to Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen, said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Tallin Flora, where he scored 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian National Team.
Prosan is scheduled to be with RoPS on Saturday in the Seinajoki, where the Rovaniemis meet with the Finnish master SJK.
RoPS had a need for a new attacker when Alexander Kokko moved to Australia during the last season.
The threatening modern family star meets again: teen-star shorts reveal almost everything.
A modern family comedy series, a friend of Alex Dunphyna’s acquaintances, re-introduces Ariel Winter by presenting her proud body.
Winter was photographed in Hollywood this week in minishorts, which don’t leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor’s feet but also the back of this.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making its style and behavior much more courageous.
The star has positioned in the pictures published in social media in very little clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen to wear very little clothes.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has recently published several photos of itself celebrating.
If the picture doesn't show, you can look at it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has radically changed her public image.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerWomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter had a \"typical Hollywood-forming\" change, from child star to adult.
He has been on television for almost all his life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more he shows the surface, the more publicity and attention he receives in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the modern family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has upset some of his long-term fans with his imago change.
It’s not hard to guess where he will be in ten years’ time when he’s already about as hard as he is, says a woman in Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the women’s fans, however, defend the actor and ask to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what others say.
You are inspired by many women, a young woman.
Japan wants to visit the Nordics, preferably to Finland - tourists are attracted to Revontul: In the autumn it is possible to see a random storm aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start the renovation journeys from the beginning, Visit Finland says in the newsletter.
Japan's main destinations are Inari and Levi.
The Revon lights are our winter travel carts, and they are strongly connected to the winter and beautiful landscapes.
In the winters of Lapland, we have a very high demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
It’s rare to know that the revolution is beginning from the autumn of the past and continues to be long in the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called “mirror aurora” in which the lake’s surface reflects the revolution lights made from the vision of a two-fold random, says the Marketing Manager Anne Lind.
The main target group of the Visit Finland Revontuli campaign is the wealthy Japanese women aged 25 to 35, who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, including online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers from Turku and Tokyo universities, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see more unique attractions in Finland, and this Revontula says that there is a huge potential.
Stays of Japanese travellers have grown significantly more than other Nordic countries in Finland.
Last year, they stayed more than twice in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
Japan is interested in Finland’s tourism as a target group because they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, Japanese people spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain was satisfied with the silver rugby-7 when Fiji's master team won gold.
The UK’s impressive success in the Rugby game of seven players was shattered when Fidzi won it on Thursday at Rio’s Deodoro Stadium in the final number 43-7.
Fidzi gave the master's teaching in ball processing, transfers, side drills, support games, runners and raw power and thus won gold – if the country had the first Olympic medal in its history.
The battle meant silver, which was slightly more lean than the UK, because it was the third silver of the country on the same day. They could be proud of their success in the Rugby-7 tournament in the Olympics, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A strong victory from South African Bokse in the 7th semi-final was likely to have a negative impact on the team in the finals on the same day.
In spite of this, the Fiji team would have won the British team, even though the 15-person team had been in full power.
The UK may be comforted by the fact that at least one British man will get his neck tomorrow: Head coach Ben Ryan, former English Rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
The experience has been quite great for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games in the Adelaide Sevens tournament in Ryan's training.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
The loss is painful, but progress is disturbing.
Fidzi started excellently and introduced his own tactics to the UK as a result of entertainment.
It seemed as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had hit a bunch of moving buses, and the world's champions rose up to 5-0, when Osea Kolinisau made a crash at the corner.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwai made another goal on the right side of the goal.
The situation was 12 to 0, and the UK had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell’s great guarantee prevented the shocking Leone Nakarawaa from making a third goal, but it did not slow down Fiji’s spending long ago.
When the game was played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalu made a goal at the right angle, after which the UK had 17-0 losses.
Nakarawa made another goal for a further start, when the first half of the game time was still over a minute.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou hit the UK team through even more powerless strikes and hit the finish line.
After the landing, the opening period ended from 29 to 0.
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play the Rugby of seven players, while the British are still in the role of a boy.
Which is a lot of right.
The UK made large-scale changes in the half-time and managed to arrest the Fijins for a total of four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored the goal thanks to the excellent team of the Fijins.
Dan Norton managed to narrow down the situation by making the UK a goal to the left, but the game had long since been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing.
Fidz’s pure joy was difficult not to admire.
Mata Viliame made the final scene of the Fidzian cake by still making the goal at the last minute.
The bell was ringing, the Fidzians embraced each other, and the British fell into the field, completely crushed.
In the past day, Fidzi had won the Japanese semi-final in the 20th century, and the UK had narrowed down by South Africa in a tight semi-final where the UK's goal was solved.
Kyle Brown took the South African Boks to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and fell below the paint poles in the second half.
Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony Watson, an English 15 player’s rugby team, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to fight gold
The more emotional the gold could not be in these races.
From the first bet on Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, they settled on 220 winning bets in history and found additional meaning for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although in the air they were two, the boat seemed to be the third coach Robin Williams's voice, which encouraged them to do their second consecutive Olympic gold in women's twins. This makes them the first women in the history of British sports that reach the same achievement.
Their power was indisputable, the victory was already 39 consecutive and once again recordable to them.
What we see, two great athletes joining the water level as the springs age, do not fully match the nature of success.
There is a large number of helpful hands behind each row, each of which has contributed to two per cent of the achievements. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach, who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who did not know if he would see this day.
Williams said the situation was tight at the time.
“I had a bladder cancer, and the tumor was able to cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes a little bit of thinking.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third one was lucky that Williams was able to begin treatment outside the season of the species in early 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible if this was the case in these circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It worked as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department at 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time, when they said that a few steps were enough.
That's where it starts.
The war itself is already a journey, but it made it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the two ideas were at Williams, who had spent the morning nervous and spoke a little more normal in trying to overcome their own unrest.
The British royal artillery captain Stanning, who had a tour behind Afghanistan, says: “I’ve been in ruins this week, which may be a bit extreme, but that means so much.
“It’s just telling me how much this means to me and how much we’ve worked with Helen and Robin.
For the last three years, Helen and Robin's cash register have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so immeasurably thank him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person with whom to train, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The two have found an overwhelming rhythm to which their competitors have failed to draw the blood.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the twins of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
“We were very caught in the moment.
Helen Hoki-Pysysy, stay with us.
It's very important that you don't get off the road.
“We were happy to leave, and at the same time we did not try to do anything amazing.
We didn't aim for heaven today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race we did.
Two think about a year before deciding about their future.
Glover is celebrating next month with Steve Backshall
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say that this was my last competition.
It would have brought too much pressure.
“After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time, it took about four minutes to realize.
This feels so much better, he says.
Iceland is changing the government of Panama leaks
Iceland will hold premature parliamentary elections in October, which were already demanded by protesters who were angry with Panama data leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed a number of Islamic politicians’ evasion of taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlagsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for protesters.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to organize new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election has now been decided on 29 October.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the last-day rage of the people affects the autumn election result.
In June, the presidential elections clearly saw criticism of the rulers, and Gudni Johannesson was elected as president from outside the policy.
Trump said he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of Isis.
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his last speech.
He said he was sarcastically claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder and candidate for the establishment of the Hillary Clinton organization.
The Democratic Party was angry with speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
As commander of the army, you should never let anyone fall down like that, Clinton's tweet.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned Muslim favorite to cover the use of burkini swimwear on the bathing beaches, for example, the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to beaches and swimming for anyone who does not have a good way and a swimming suit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear, which largely express religious connections, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds of people were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two men connected to Isis attacked the church in Northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of swimming water in the Oulu region passed through the Seula - Püykösjärvi blue cementation
Water samples taken from the official bathing sites of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
There has been a blue fibrillation only on the beach of Lake Püykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, Oulu’s environmental action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing sites in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the coast of Meriniemi, the levels of E.coli and enterococobacteria from all bathing areas were below the limits of the measures adopted in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The water content of the seaniemi bathing area E.coli and enterocococ was confirmed on Wednesday, when the presence of bacteria had fallen below the limits of the measure.
The blue cement found on the bathing beach of Lake Püykösjärvi is not yet unsaturated, but in favourable circumstances the situation can quickly turn into a blue-grained flower, where the water surface is formed from a blue-green resting ground on the floor.
The environmental action follows the situation with enhanced inspections.
If the blue fibrillation turns into a blue cap, it will also be reported separately on the bathing board.
See the results of bathing water samples here.
Leadership: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
Forest reduction is one of the tax changes in the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance for the next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction that would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generation of forest farms.
The Ministry of Finance has four objectives: to promote the generation of forest farms, to increase the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of the forest farm and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote an entrepreneurial forest economy.
The forest owner would reduce the clean capital result of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool that promotes the generation of forest farms is good, comments by Juha Hakkarainen, the Director of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, it is important to find a critical tax change proposal.
Forest reduction is a task of the clean capital result of the forest owner.
It is a capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
According to MKK and Hakkarainen, the effect of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the sales result of the tree.
The VM proposal is based on a reduction in the clean capital income of forestry by preventing the loss of the capital income of forestry, which should be reduced in other taxation.
Such a person would get tax benefits even if he did not sell wood.
The model of calculation is very complex.
The average forest owner is unable to figure it out, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, the model concerns only a small part of forest owners.
The tax reduction limit linked to the forest's return value is EUR 40,000 in the proposal.
It has been pulled too high in the opinion of Hakkarainen.
As such, 82% of Finnish forest owners were cut off.
The model would have an impact of around 10% of the forest ownership division, he says.
The VM considers that the limit ensures the objective of increasing the holding.
In forest politics, forest donation has been carried out for decades by Hakkarainen.
Its background is the ageing of the forest owners.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.

There is no more accurate knowledge of their injuries.
The driver of the car that was driving before was not injured.
The accident occurred on the highway 8 Himanga a few kilometers from Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings of the Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the incidence of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as chest tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to match the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the efficacy of cancer medications may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.
Research results have been published on 4 August in a prestigious Nature Communications journal in the field of cell biology.
The Muhus family home death continues in the court, the prosecutor also calls for a murder sentence for another person.
The tree of the muhos family home death continues in the court for both convicted.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the death of the Muhoos family home.
The other received 8 years for 4 months from the killing and gross robbery of a young person, among other things.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment for murder and gross robbery as a young person.
The person convicted of the killing also received a judgment on the serious risk of road safety as a young person and the driving of a vehicle as a young person.
The judgment of the District Court was appealed by the prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who had been convicted of a more severe sentence.
The prosecutor calls for a lesser-criminal man to be convicted of murder as a young person for 12 years in prison.
They were at the time of the act in full understanding.
According to the case law, 17-year-olds killed a man who was a director of the child protection unit in the school home in July of last year.
A 17-year-old assassin was attacked by a director sitting on the couch of the living room, according to the judgment.
The director had come out of the boat and tolerated the young man in his room, when another young man hit him with a vacuum pipe.
Among other things, the director was strangled with wire, hit and kicked in the head.
According to a mental study, both convicted were at the time of the act in full understanding.
According to law, young people had been planning an escape from family homes at least since the previous day.
The ice shark is the longest vertebrate in the world, and only increases at the age of 156.
The world’s longest living vertebrate is the ice shark, according to a research published in the Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, like the ice shark floating around Greenland, the vault can live up to 400 years old.
The woman is only growing at the age of 156.
The ice age increases by only a centimetre per year.
Only one species of shellfish is known for longer live ice.
Scientists found out about their age with radiocarbons.
Because of the nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on this, researchers were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The oldest one was estimated to be 392 years old - though the throw in the direction or the other can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an Economic Visa - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need anything else in the world.
Even a third of all the tax revenues of the state would not be received if the change to the corporate tax imposed by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially with the richest tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax program as a revolutionary, presenting it on Monday in Detroit.
The company tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
It would be a huge amount, $1,000 a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39,6, after the reduction made by Trump.
The inheritance tax would be fully waived.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation of the business and of driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
The environmental standards decided by emergency intervention must be renewed and energy regulation broken down.
The Barack Obama Health Reform must be taken into consideration.
The administration must be appointed – experts rather than bureaucrats –
Trump said that trade policy is the biggest cause of the US problems.
Free trade agreements would be announced.
Imports from China would be subject to a 45 per cent penalty tax and 35 per cent of Mexico.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globality, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump’s America does not need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes to connect cities, American ships to control the sea, American steel to raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
By way of exception, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, even though well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump’s program leading the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced his own program early on Friday in Finland.
Attack from the past - People's News
The sea is arguably milling, but the real attack wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street, an accounting with the past can begin.
It is the core of Pedro Almodovar's new story.
Almodovar's previous steering work Travel lovers (2013) was a little fun and roskin-side satirical comedy, the pre-existing skin where I live (2011) the tops of the Spanish tour career.
Similarly, Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between these two works.
It’s a syndicated love, relationships, and family drama with a mother and daughter at the heart.
The story is a symple and we see it as a long backdrop.
Life seems to be modelled for a middle-aged named person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the later ads of a random encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) must always be in wonder until the end of the film.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Julieta once in her life stages for her grown-up daughter.
He begins the time before the birth of his daughter, from the time when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Juliet’s young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, will rise to the second female main part of the television show, the time between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta’s ageing has been treated in a way that can be considered a kitchen, but I would say that time with a slow and literal, one-off holiday.
For almodóvar films, often for such a characteristic ligament, humor is always a fair distance in Juliet.
It is a evenly played, controlled, place in places with good music and a very sad film with such ingredients for the elegance.
Instead, the typical visual colour brightness of the Spanish director is stored and so that it begins to put a little bit of silence in the eye as a purer as a functioning dramatic means of action.
Diseases, deaths, or other sudden loss of the film, but the surface remains one Korean.
This applies in particular to costumes: in the case of a named person, the inhabitants change from one scene to another, and the same applies to the visible ears.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main issue, i.e. the viruses of this scene, is not particularly improved.
The mechanically repeated impression is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has made the script on the basis of the three novels of the Canadian Alice Munron, awarded by Nobel in 2013.
Novellit has been published in the book of Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in the dialogue, resulting in a slightly smooth written literary filming.
Materials would have been emotionally more emotionally dramatic, so much big things - especially scalable guilt - the subject matter of the film is being dealt with.
Directed by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on the three novels of Alice Munro.
Main: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The movie first is 12.8.
The government is trying to vote - People's News
No new cuts will be made, cheap ministers, so that the basic Finns do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are made by a crisp shop.
There will be no new cuts.
The remaining four billion savings are sufficient.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (kok.) are convinced of the budgetary gap.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, since social security cuts were already decided in the spring framework.
Child welfare, state pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pensions Index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training cuts continue.
Gymnastics
Why are the ministers so hard to emphasize that there are no new cuts on them?
Because next year is the election year.
Locals will be held in April and will be the main hot label of the elections, not the gallops.
It has been seen before that the outcome of the municipal elections in different directions will ruin the government's mood for a long time.
However, the Gallupits say that the government party is waiting for a shrink loss, although the result of its previous election was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the basic Finns received 752 new powers, the price of influence in the right government for most of them next spring.
The lifeline of the government of the three parties is in the interests of the basic Finnish people.
It has not taken long now, but more than half of the voters had the need for government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visit have become surface.
In the first place, new cuts will not be made – the fact that next year they will be made violently and, second, they will be tried to soften the impact that awaits the basic Finnish people.
Major cuts in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different - if the Sipila government is still up.
The government has set the target of indebtedness in this parliamentary term, but the Petteri Orpo budget proposal will owe EUR 5.9 billion next year, more than this year.
After municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the electoral period and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: debt is not folded or even slowed.
The other one has to stick to the program.
This means new cuts in the budget line for 2017.
The budget would be drawn at least close to the balance during 2018, and then in the spring, Parliamentary elections will receive what will come.
These measures do not allow for debt
It is quite clear that the current measures do not change the debt, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to ease the positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary-General Martti Hetemäki at the information conference prove it irresponsibly:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved overoptimistic, i.e. no veto aid from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not recently risen since the collapse in 2008, except in the context of a temporary recovery policy at the beginning of the 2010s.
In this decade, unemployment has increased by 35% and prolonged from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs €3 billion a year more than in 2008.
The current government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, rises to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, debt recovery was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs about EUR 6 billion, which is practically fully covered by new debt.
This is the idea of the centre, meeting, and of the basic Finns of what is responsible.
Question: You want to leave a lot of tasks to the community.
Three out of four consider that the organisation of day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A large majority of the people also hold responsibility for the individual community, including libraries, culture, citizens’ studies, building supervision, high school education, and waste management.
On the other hand, the responsibility of the county is more clearly sought by county planning, special care, vocational training, universities of applied sciences and institution care for developing disabled people.
No tasks under the authority of the municipalities are intended to be transferred to the State.
Underage wheel jogging ran a run-back drive to end the police escape
A 16-year-old motorcycling driver ran a police party in Joensuu on Friday night at half a hour.
The police department tried to stop without the lights of the time of the motorcycle, but the young man went to drive the police to escape a fair speed.
The retreat continued on the Sonkaja beach, from which to Soronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle was driven out of the road.
After that, the young man left the runaway, but the faster-walked police ran into the fugitive.
The driver's blow test showed a 0.75 prom.
He also did not have a driver's license that would justify driving on a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the rock cargo fell into the stream.
The truck in the rock cargo fell into the stream at the Kavijärvi on Thursday at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had driven to the left on the map in the corner of the road and fell on its side in the stream.
The rescue facility took the injured driver out of the broken truck through the door left over, together with the rescue helicopter staff and the emergency attendants.
Lifting the vehicle was the responsibility of the car owner.
The lost truck poured hydraulic oil on the road, which was absorbed by the rescue facility.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon at the Air River
The 87-year-old woman has been missing in Lahtilä, Lahtilä, South Ostrobothnia since the afternoon.

The observations and tips on lost movements are requested to call the North State Situation Centre’s reference number 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - look at the photo gallery of the damage to Parafest
Parafest festival tents poured into the espionage flow caused massive damage.
The President of the Parafestus of Joensuu, Mr Pippuri, estimates that the festival will be economically accessible to its feet, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of the Parafest Kalle Salonen appeared on Friday night at the end of the tower.
On Saturday, the program will continue with presentations held at the city theater premises starting at 13.
The Art Centre in Ahjo is the Parafest exhibition 13-15.
The program will be planned.
The escalating flow occurs in a thunderstorm when rainwater and its weight trigger the descending air flow.
The changes in the water shape of the water in the water cloud are binding on heat, and therefore the descending air is cooling and its speed is accelerating towards the ground.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that escalating flows occur in Finland during several summers.
It is difficult to predict the route of escalating flows.
The espionage was hit by Parafest at the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people were mildly offended.
There was one child who was transported to a mildly injured post-treatment group.
Air pollution is ageing Londonians
According to the study, the skin of the Londons is getting older faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The British study tells us about the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic tiny particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many people with a retirement age is two and a half years older than the age group living in rural areas.
Skin-earning tiny particles are a very good dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, die from nearly 9 500 Londons every year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for the London people who walk on their way to work in the vicinity of the congestion streets.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example with different masks, but a more practical solution is recommended for regular skin cleaning.
Tractor's brakes betrayed the man standing in front of you.

Josban, Kataja and Jokipoki to the U.S. National Team
Anne JPampinen has played almost all the Salibandy World Championships since 2003.
Now, in Tampere, there are already 6th races, only 2013 remained in the middle of Canada after being better in North America.
I was working in Turku and playing at the women's club when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Salibandy country team.
I was interested and here I am, Jpartnernen, 48, says.
It was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, JPampinen reached the University of Joensuu to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, it wasn't like the kind that was played at the SM level.
It was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoj, ice hockey in the SM series, Jämpinen remembers.
The JP partner played the Salibandy SM series during the 1991-92 season, followed by three in Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the club A-girls in the championship.
Women’s SM series career peaked in 1995.

Beach volley Theatre Essi Hasun's circle closes to Kouvola - SM gold is missing from the award cabinet
Essi Hasu is finishing as a beach volley player at least after a temporary period.
Beach volleyy Finnish Championships will be settled on a weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, medals will be played in both adult and young series.
In co-operation with the Kouvola Airballs and the Finnish Aviation Balloon Association, six best pairs of each series of rankings will be eligible for the SM final tournament.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Elimäe NMKY by Essi Hasu, who has been part of the Finnish beach volley peaks for several years.
Today, Hasu, living in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to watch this weekend.
I'm sure Pesisstadion will have a great arena.
I haven’t played in adult series very often in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in final home angles, Hasu tunnel.
The Kouvola area set fire to Hasun's high sport and gave good cookies to a fine hobby.
There are very memories of childhood.
I started the volleyball at the age of nine in Elimäe's NMKY's E-girls.
The main thing is too big a game shirt in mind, knee protectors in the ankles, as well as huge backs and choreographs after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small area, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group’s shared spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All families were strongly involved - the father of the teammater coached us and our mother was the president of the club for a long time.
At the time of June, Essi Hasulle beach volley was a natural choice of species for the counterweight of the internal air balloon.
There has been a song on the beach since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to the junior SM tour, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream will be realized when Hasu plays on the weekend together with Pixemäki Annina Parkkinen in the SM-Finals.
The goal of the second-ranked two after Riikka Lehtinen and Taru Lahti in the tournament is clear.
A realistic goal is to have a medal.
We still lack SM gold from the award cabinet, Hasu throws me with dignity.
The event of the weekend in Kouvola may be in front of the last known audience of Hasulle.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civil work.
The international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toes are put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon Koli went to be an agricultural entrepreneur.
As an entrepreneur, agriculture means risk-taking, sweat and strength.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in the countryside as well.
Koli started two years ago with her little brother, Valtteri Koli, acting as a successor to their home.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural operator meant borrowing and ordering an increase so that bread could come out of the hands of agriculture.
This has been my thing since my little boy.
I’ve always been happy with the farm, and now that I’ve started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it should be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a jet, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
However, I really went along with the project and I’ve been fully involved in it, Solomon’s Koli says and adds that he would not have done it if he didn’t believe in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would turn to good.
The aim of Solomon Koli, which is growing muscle cars, is to invest in its even bigger navet.
The work has produced the result, as Solomon Koli has chosen to be among the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of the Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a potential victory.
He will be able to vote on the website until 21 August.

The average annual inflation over the last 12 months (from July 2015 to July 2016) measured by CPI compared to the previous 12 months (from July 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8 %.
In July 2016, the consumer price index was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate from the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared with December 2015) was -0.2%, and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.

Snapchat Anime Power is Criticized as an Asian Caricature
Snapchat says that this filter was an anime, but some observers believe it is racist.
The Snapchat lens tool allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play in identical ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into an anaks, dogs or characters in Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
Birds are inexhaustible, distinctive distortive tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfie per day.
All the misconceptions quickly come to public knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have received a review where it has been accused of popularizing blackface or bleached skin shades as a beauty.
So when it offered to some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into vibrations, mistped teeth, and made cheek sticks, some of the critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people.
The critics also wondered if these repeated conflicts referred to the greater problem that the company had with the difference.
News and rage spread on a large Wednesday and wrote about it, among other things, the Verge and Motherboard day after Snapchat said he had removed the filter.
The company explained the following: the lens was designed to honor anime characters, not the caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some of us were delighted about the anime comparison.
Korean art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweeted images were widely shared, said in his email that the lens was at least offensive and awkward.
He adds: “It is difficult to deny the parallel of an extremely tasty Asian caricature to the filter’s strengths.
It shows that the filter is not only a \"yellowface\" but is taken to the debilitating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, it is always the ultimate struggle for diversity and social inclusion from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat’s large audience consists of young people who are ethnic backgrounds more diverse than their parents’ counterparts. This may mean that they are likely to expect even more sophisticatedness.
“When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates a picture that violates the user, this type of things will no longer be very easy to notice, as before,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
As a product manager and designer, Zhu, working in the Medidium publishing platform, decided to remove his Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In his writing and telephone interviews at the media, he said he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company’s majority of white and male leaders and decided to write with hashtag: #DelateSnapchat.
“It’s either that there are no colored people in their one-sided staff, when they can make decisions like this, or then they also have coloring as employees, but their position is not that they dare to speak their opinion directly and easily,” says Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the claim.
The company does not publish figures of the ethnic background of its staff, relying on its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of his staff, but according to his reporter, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on the under-represented groups of people and the promotion of participation within the company.
Zhu says that his Snapchat account is closed and adds: “I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK.
According to Congress expert team, military officials have misinterpreted information about Isis.
On Thursday, the Congress Expert Group published a report that the US military officials, Central Command, changed intelligence ports so that they would give a more optimistic picture of the war against Isis in Iraq and Syria than what happened on the ground.
The Republican presidents of the U.S. Committee for Foreign Affairs (House Armed Services Committee) set up a working group to report on the general dissatisfaction of the armed intelligence analysts, according to the analysts, the senior military authorities were scrutinizing the actions of the Americans against the ISIS.
Central Command, in short Centcom, is a US military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligences accepted by Centcom’s senior leaders generally gave a more positive picture of the U.S. counter-terrorism activities than the facts in the field, and were, without exception, more positive than in the analysis of other entities in the intelligence community, the press release on the report.
“Centcom’s events cannot be accepted – our soldiers suffer when high-level political decision-makers are presented with false analysis,” says California Republican representative Ken Calvert.
“The errors in the Centcom management portal go beyond the level of the organization.
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015, which include Central Command's descriptions and analysis of American actions to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that the reports ordered by Obama’s administrative authorities have been counterfeited, it provides an analytical picture of the perception that Centcom’s leaders would have pushed them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
“In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command’s press releases, statements and statements to Congress were much more positive than the events actually were,” the report says.
“For example, Centcom’s official publicly issued a statement stating that a large military attack on Mosul could already take place in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under Isis control.
“After months of research, this is very clear,” says the Kansas Republican representative Mike Pompeo.
“From mid-2014 to mid-2015, U.S. military intelligence officers manipulated the intelligence received to reduce the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a working group after learning about the doubts raised by analysts that intelligence data about Isis would have been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday follows more accurate results, as the studies continue.
In addition, the Ministry of Defence Inspector General has launched an investigation into Centcom’s intelligence.
On Thursday, the members of the Committee responsible for the House’s inquiry published their own findings, which were partly consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an too limited process of evaluating intelligence data on the security forces of ISIS and Iraq, said Adam B. Schiff, a high-ranking Democratic representative of the Committee.
According to Schiff, this process was delayed by the publication of intelligence findings, – your violation of the morals of analysts – and – unsatisfiedly different views –
However, according to Schiff and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House would have tried to pressure the analysts of Centcom to adapt their conclusions to a pre-ordered or political official line.
Daily Beast announced the preliminary results of the survey by Congress on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times announced a study by the Pentagon supervisor, which was initiated as a result of the complaints made by Centcom analysts.
Officer of the Pentagon, Lieutenant-in-Chief Patrick Evans, reports that the Department of Defense does not comment on the Congress report as long as the inspection of the inspector is ongoing.
However, he says: “The experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security.
The investigation also has other consequences, in addition to trying to determine whether the U.S.-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a statement made by a number of defence authorities).
However, the claims made last year made it question how much President Obama can rely on the Central Command and that it would give honest assessments of the military operation of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism about intelligence about fathers was responsible for the differences that occurred more than a decade ago, when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that said the government of President George W. Bush, despite the objections of many analysts, supported only small groups in Iraq and spent a little time thinking about what would be followed by the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion on ISIS intelligence.
According to the authorities last year, the Hooker Group concluded that, despite opposing public statements, air strikes at ISIS-controlled refineries had not significantly undermined the terrorist group's economy, as it had built temporary processing plants and thus managed to sell oil in the dark market.
However, the results of the study were not transmitted outside the Central Command, reports The Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was the subject of criticism last year after many legislators had assessed the testimony given to the Senate as being too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as Commander of the Central Command.
The United States will win the Fourth Double Fight in Women's Country Hockey and consolidate its position in the interdependence with the UK
After three goals in victory, I painted 6 to 6 in the game of Japan against Katie Bam made the first two goals for the U.S. women's country hockey team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but the 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had previously succeeded in the same way.
\"I have no idea,\" he says.
“I don’t belong to people who keep a number of the paintings they’ve made.
However, he knows this: Americans have won four games in their Olympics and lost zero games and share their first place in their group with the UK, who continued to win their winnings on Thursday in the Japanese chapter 2-0.
The UK and the United States play the opposite on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams survived the final match, which will determine which of them will be the first and which of the six teams will be the first.
The first place to avoid a longer time meeting with the Dutch team, which won the second chapter.
Despite the fact that on Saturday, Americans have already raised their surprising success in these races, four years after it was left for the last 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and was first infected with land hockey until the age of 3 (his older twin sister played the species in Drexel). He reached the country team at the age of 16, and thus was the youngest country team player of all time.
The 2008 Olympic Games missed him when he did not survive the final player list.
After that, the 2012 competitions came where he and his team were not very successful.
The following year, the coach was appointed an English coach Craig Parnham, after which things began to change.
“It was cultural, spiritual and physical,” Bam said.
“Our work in London wasn’t the same as it is now.
We've made a full translation.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the paint counter in the first half by hitting the ball close to the impact.
India had become a game without any tournament wins, but it turned out to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained the 1-0 situation until the third episode, when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball for a long time along the left side of the field, wrapped it in the middle of the field, hit the ball in the paint, and thus took the Americans to 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth phase.
The game was the first tournament in which American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the American goal was to sink into each hit.
Briggs is now living in his success period,
Just like Bam.
“Our job is good now,” says Parnham, but how good it depends on the results of the Saturday game.
In the middle of the Olympics, trampoline brings zen
Regardless of the time and location, the Olympics will inevitably run into them.
Rio de Janeiro events, competitions and struggles seem to be the next exciting message constantly and everywhere.
It’s like an Olympic ball itself would be a flaming message capsule that moves from spring to swimmer, swimmer to gymnastic and gymnastic triathlonist.
You can’t open a television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The first time of the Olympics, Dooley's charm with his smile, and it might well be the name on all the lips that would appear and belong to the best viewing and listening time, would be popular for sponsors and would be a good mind in TV ads if he were just a swimmer, a gymnastic or even a swordman.
But the Dooley, 28 of California's Lake Forest, competes with the Olympic gold trampoline.
Olympic light does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Far from the center, partly in the shadow are less well-known sports, such as air pistol ammo, bowball, and taekwondo.
We will always have a broom, and keep the championship with us for a long time.
But if I'm allowed to write a modest story about my own special favor, I'd like to draw attention to the charming charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic race since 2000, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so limited that many of the people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic race.
Ignorance can be regional.
The United States has, of course, participated in the Olympic Trampoline, but the country has never reached medals and has never progressed to finals before 2012.
Men's trampoline medals seem to go to Chinese and Russians, and women's side of the medalals are the men's men's Canadians.
Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLenna defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
Trampoliin, however, has the charm of the underworlder, partly because the uncivilized ear sounds more appropriate to the circus school than the Olympics.
(I know in this connection that I am not an expert, just a regular fan.)
The species have the potential to assemble, which has been used in the drawings in the endless continuous shooting scenes of characters. But it also has the same dignity as in gymnastics and swimming jumps, i.e. in species that combine in trampoline essentially.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, meaning “poncholine”
The ambitious masters jump with a huge trampoline that sprays them to a height of nearly 10 metres. Before landing on their feet, jumpers must make a series of acrobat movements, such as tours, skills and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, the jumps are evaluated based on performance, difficulty and flight time.
In Rio, there are 32 athletes who come from 17 different countries, 16 of them and 16.
The general direction of the Olympics is directly ahead.
In pursuit of gold, medals must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to a paint line or a starting wall, they also have another goal they are pursuing in television-driven reporters, namely a world-wide or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is luxurious, admirable, even fanatical – and is enough even to get the tears of the viewer.
But I also think this is a little exhausting when watching the race.
This is where trampoline offers a breathtaking break.
In Trampoli, the direction is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast is going to pull up like an astronaut, fall down, and stick back to the back of the effort.
The species, of course, also include a competitive aspect, and it is also not easy, but it does not involve an intense attack on the paint or jumping far, only a dreamy and melting combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to the zen as only the Olympics can reach.
Women’s car racing and finals will take place on Friday afternoon and start at 13.00 local time and men will match the races on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will send the finals as part of the afternoon broadcast, which will start on each day at 14.00 local time.
In the midst of Olympia, there is a calm and wonderful moment that may be missed in the midst of a common drunk.
And if awareness can only be increased by providing attractive male athletes and objectizing them – as the US men's team said recently, Wall Street Journal suggested – in this case Logan Dooley is just waiting for a noticeable new fan team.
The entire generation protested in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have broken down violent protests requiring political change across Ethiopia.
According to eye witnesses, several protesters have been shot to death in co-operation with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking down?
For the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable ally in the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
However, over the past few months, the country has shaken anti-government protests that are spreading to more and more regions.
In the last week alone, thousands of people attacked the streets, requiring a radical political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was unrelenting.
According to the witness, the police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
The demonstrations are expected at the end of last year or in the videos described at the beginning of this year, showing how the security forces beat young people who have been forced to stand against the wall with their hands.
The UN’s leading human rights official is now calling for thorough research.
“Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and taking it forward is even more difficult,” says Rashid Abdi, International Crisis Group Research Director of the African Sarvi project.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, which has been promoted by the Western countries.
The U.S. military and intelligence services strongly support the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia. Only few African countries, if any, will receive so much help from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, the capital of Addis Ababa has even a new garden train.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from the model of democracy, and human rights organisations have constantly reported government repression policy, opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly silenced.
Many people have been expelled from the country, captured, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
“If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to show their mind, it will be demolished,” says Seyoum Teshome, who works as a newspaper at the University of Central Ethiopia.
“All young people show their minds.
The whole generation protests.
There are many issues of dissatisfaction, from the use of land to the discipline of the government coalition.
Last year, after a widely criticized election, the ruling party and its allies had a last position in the opposition, leading to the rule of the whole Parliament.
At the same time, tensions grow at Eritrea’s border, where the violent situation required hundreds of deaths in the June battle.
Analysts fear that in recent years, more or less defeated separatist groups, such as Oromo's release line or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may try to exploit confusion and re-arm themselves.
The reason why a bitter mood, which has been under the surface for many years, is being demolished right now, has many reasons.
The first is obvious innocent: smartphones.
Only a couple of years ago, Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media when cheaper smartphones became common and internet access improved.
However, even when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many will access the internet through intermediation servers that hide their location.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was what they called people to protest.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest groups of people in Ethiopia, the valleys and the amhars.
Oromes and amaras are not natural allies.
In Ethiopia, mainly from the Christian high lands, amhars have long ruled the country’s politics and business, and have torn the valleys, many of which are Muslims and live in the field.
But this is also changing.
“Cohesion is deepening and we’re getting under the same umbrella,” says Mulatu Gemechu, the director of the Oromo.
The biggest protests have been in the Orome and Amhara areas.
Many Amharans and Oromes experience Ethiopia being unfairly dominated by the tigren tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population and however dominates the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason behind unrest is the death of Meles Zenawin.
The former rebel leader, Meles, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a disease without mention in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see behind the corner.
According to analysts, he was particularly skilled in detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using the ambassadors who reconciled the opponents’ traps.
“The current government lacks this essential instinct,” says Professor Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desaegn, entered the boots of Meles from almost unknown.
Unlike Meles, who was home to the region of Tigre, North Ethiopia, Haiemaram comes from the south.
According to analysts, he has no confidence in the security forces managed by the tigre tribe.
Many people are afraid of this means more bleeding.
Last time in Ethiopia, similar riots were found in 2005, when thousands of people expressed their opinion against the elections, which the government initially took and then stole.
In post-election restlessness, many protesters were killed. However, the dead were less than in the previous months, and the unrest ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for long-term infrastructure planning, such as new ground trains, and significant progress in combating poverty.
But the inner beauty towards the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented power.
And the apple is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondari attacked tiger-owned companies, and the hate speech against tigers is growing in social media.
According to analysts, protests place the United States and other Western allies in a tukala situation.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned, neighbouring Somalia-watched aircraft, but the base has recently been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its allies in the fragile region to collapse.
\"This requires a tight balance,\" Abdi says.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama to be the founder of Isis.
Donald J. Trump tried to pull his words back on Friday in his last campaign in the fight, claiming he wasn't serious about claiming to be President Obama and Hillary Clinton's terrorist group, ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican candidate’s ability to communicate clearly to his country’s citizens.
Also, his supporters must try to defend their candidates at these stressful moments and explain comments that he may not have meant.
Trump made a statement at a conference on Wednesday night and repeated various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that President and Hillary Clinton had created Isis.
Early Friday morning Trump tweeted and said his claim was sarcasm.
Trump was in a tweet about the previous day, when I said he was in a lot of interviews about his accusations completely serious.
When the radio driver and conservator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften their claim by stating that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to withdraw his claim.
The last review storm rose when Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy when the numbers of support fell.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy speech in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and considered Clinton's speech boring.
Trump has defended the sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received a wide-ranging criticism when he called on the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's e-mail. Later, he explained his comments by saying: \"I was sarcastic, too.
In this way, Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and pulls his words back if necessary.
“I believe it’s his way of testing certain messages that respond to his supporters. He sees how the supporters respond to messages, and, in a way or in a different way, depending on the reactions, says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
“But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are round enough to pass through the different sides.
Rather than softening his opinions to the election audience, Trump has changed his style even more in recent days when his support numbers have continued to fall.
On Friday, a new opinion study by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist announced that Trump’s support is significantly lower in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is tightly balanced.
While Trump usually tries to avoid asking for forgiveness for his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics that they misinterpret his words or do not understand his sense of humor.
But after becoming increasingly observable in the last months of his presidential election campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in a awkward position, in which they have to publicly defend Trump's comments, no matter how provocative they are.
One of Trump's most important supporters, former mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended the presidential candidate in the CNN interview on Thursday.
\"I think his words were justified, as a political speech,\" answered Giuliani, asking him if Trump was true in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton were founded by Isis.
“It’s true that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama called a totally wrong series team, and that’s why he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most Republicans representing the mainstream are trying to claim that the Obama administration, where Hillary Clinton was a foreign minister, allowed ISIS to continue its operations when it did not deal with the situation in a determined way in the Middle East.
Before Friday’s election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter, where he accused them of beating his speech and discriminating attitude towards him.
He mocked the unspeakable and pathetic television scanners trying to figure out him out, but he said he couldn't succeed in it.
Some Democrats mocked Trump’s explanation and said it was only to show more clearly that he was not a suitable president.
Due to an unfair rent rise, the stopped cafe opens in GreenPoint
Verb Cafe was a bit of an explosive cafe in Williamsburg, where only a cash machine was made and there was no Wi-Fi, but which offered a good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe was priced out of the streetside on Bedford Avenue when the rental was unreasonable.
Verb Cafe replaced in summer 2014 by Soap Cherie sells cup cake-shaped soaps.
The locals consider this to be a means of avoiding the loss of a café under the middle classification.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is changing, I know, but I still can’t believe that the CBB Club is no longer there, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap shop.
But even though New York is no longer its former, there is also a new one.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new cafe for GreenPoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb cafe has Wi-Fi and can be paid with a credit card, but some of the employees have the same and the atmosphere is still inexplicable.
Coffee is also good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb café is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a client offered to finance the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very interested in doing it.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Verb Space Bagels from the same supplier as before and use the same espressomodel.
In addition, it re-used even the old Verbic lamps.
Rodriguez says he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
It is available with bacon eggs cheese-sandwiches and bulk caps and brown onion rings.
There are also dark people in the list.
Coffee is no longer available for beer, but instead for fresh fruit juices.
After spending nine months of coffee, Rodriguez says that the old standard customers began to visit Verb as a steady stream.
“A lot of our old customers were priced out of Williamsburg,” he said.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the cafe on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and visited Verb regularly.
After changing to GreenPoint, he made a walk to the Verbi located in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he said he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
\"I felt like Verb's coffee and culture,\" he said.
Now he drinks coffee again, although on that Sunday he took a chai coffee instead of his usual ice coffee, which is also a news list.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been in Verb since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before work and ordered the same thing without exception.
“I walked into the cafe every day for more than seven minutes than the machine, and there they already made my gym with all the fillings,” he says.
Picture: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Today Rosenthal continues to produce its standard products, but sometimes he varies from his bagel to bacon, egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says he doesn't wear a bead on the fact that the soap shop took an old place.
Soap Cherie’s owners even offered to make a special soap made using Verb’s own cold-roasted coffee.
“We may still be able to get to the offer,” Rodriguez says.
The Polish people who have traditionally lived in GreenPoint have also accepted the café with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into a Pole, and Rodriguez now tells him that he is looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold-roasted coffee in the cafe.
The café may also be extended to the next building.
For many customers, however, it is enough for them to get their old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the cafe was closed.
When a new place was opened and ordered a coffee there, it felt like it had come home,\" Whitt said.
\"I've eaten the smell of the cafe.
The Great Depression’s Passing Food in the New Editing: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in his lunch office in the White House.
As a culinary, President Roosevelt was fond of the luxurious dishes of the Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the Hanhen liver saucer and Maryland's turtle soup.
On that day, his menu was more modest: the Devil's eggs (deviled Eggs) in the tomato sauce, potatoes and dessert from the skeleton.
“It was an expression of culinary solidarity for people who suffer,” says Jane Ziegelman.
His husband Andrew Coe adds: “It was also a message for Americans, how they should eat.
The Brooklyn Heights couple works as both food historians.
Coe's latest book, called Chop Suey, tells about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, called 97 Orchard, says the story of the apartment in Lower East Side.
Their new work is the A Square Meal, published by Harper and published on Tuesday, which describes the history of American food as the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when they agreed to a meeting with the supplier Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron pilot and opened in the same year as the big stock market crash took place in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive-filled Sandwich and 57-year-old Coe, on the other hand, turkey, potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the journalist ordered a meat crush, the couple said it was suitable for a very large debate on the eating of the sheep season.
“The noises were very popular,” says Jane Ziegelman.
“People ate peanut jam, liver crush, and baked beans.
They were made of materials that were cheap and dirty.
Imagine your cancer so much peanuts that they are enough for the whole meal.
Andrew Coe is upset.
“It must have been pushed in the stomach like a lead,” he says.
Before the great lay-offs of the American dining table, especially in the countryside, the buffet principle – eating as much as you want –
Women made food for agricultural workers, and for breakfast, lunch, and dinner were served with counter-fed pies.
It was the Americans who had sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War, and the Square Meal is a chronicle of the way the people survived when they suddenly had to give up the abundance.
“This was the time when food became a major and disturbing topic for Americans,” Coe says and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
One of the most disturbing was the new cheap diet: according to Ziegelman, of the admirable dishes such as jams and pastries became the main food, and the pasta was said to be the “powerful means to use the food stars” because chefs could cover not so attractive the ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
The flesh, which had been a major part of American food for years, became a saving luxury.
There were strange blends, where the most important was the fulfillment of calorie and nutritional values and not so much the taste or even the healthy kitchen lake.
When researching a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared ovens filled with peanuts used as a turkey-time dish.
“It didn’t get any popularity at the dinner table,” Coe said.
Ziegelman adds: “It was unreal.
Groundnuts and garlic are not compatible at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office for Home Affairs in 1923-1943, directed people’s eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be precise budget-holders and to respond to the challenge of making carrot-cermaspage-like tasty dishes.
The Square Meal book is a celebration of historical flavours.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the reactions of the government management to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, that I have to eat cakes.
While he publicly praised his childhood with simple food on iowa, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a sophisticated gentleman who had become him.
“He liked the continental kitchen, like fish and cucumber sauce,” Coe said.
He ate almost a piece of gold-coated dining room, with a tusk on his head.
He was completely attracted to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to show an example in his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste, the food served in the White House was not only the boring, but also the worst-prepared ones in Washington.
Many of the sheep-time dishes were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition continues to show how we pay attention to calories and nutrition and how science has been applied to cooking.
The couple tell the book that they started to understand the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother, for example, why she couldn’t throw away food.
\"He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away,\" said Coe.
“People even started to get sick of his food, remembers Ziegelman.
“For the first time, windfalls...”
When the main dishes had been emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out the bone marrow food they had prepared at home, the same as President Roosevelt at lunch.
“It’s called a skeleton foam,” says Ziegelman, adding that giving a prominent name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream, only bone, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We're just trying to pick up our spoon in a thick brown suit.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe gave it another time and a third.
\"German nuts would make this better,\" Coe says to his wife, speaking of a positive budget manager.
Gilead will receive full compensation for the patent dispute between the hepatitis C medicine and Merck.
The U.S. Court of Justice has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive full compensation for the legal disputes concerning the patent of the hepatitis C medicinal product with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from 200 million dollars of damages imposed on it for the violation of two patents owned by Merck in relation to the successful drugs called Gilead Sovaldi and Harvoni. The U.S. judge found Merck committed violations of the false oath and other unfair practices.
In an action registered on Thursday, Judge Beth Labson Freeman, U.S. Court of Justice, says that Gilead was entitled to be released from the legal fees it was charged with defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can be treated with a large 90% of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other and demanded the right of private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance of Gilead medicines.
The U.S. supported forces have taken over Manbij from the Isis city of Manbij
The U.S.-based forces have captured the city of Manjib, near the border of Turkey in Northern Syria, when the last extremist fighters of the ISIS have left the city, says the messenger of the troops.
The Syrian Group of Democratic Forces (SDF) has now taken the city to find the last Isis fighters hidden in the city.
A representative of the Manbij Military Council of SDF, Sharfan Darwish told Reuters that 2,000 hostages were kidnapped by ISIS fighters.
“We’re in full possession now, but we’re still conducting search operations,” Darwish said.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal taxes.
On Friday 2015, President Hillary Clinton announced his 2015 tax return, indicating that his and his husband’s income was at the time $10.75 million and the real federal tax rate they paid was 34.2.
In 2015, Clinton donated a million dollars to charity organizations, mostly to Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned almost $5.3 million in speech fees, and former Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton announced that he had earned $3 million in the Simon & Schuster edition of his office.
Clinton's vice-president, Senator Tim Caine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton, announced a 10-year tax return.
The real federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
\"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine continue to look as a model for economic transparency,\" Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmier said.
The perfect contrast is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax information.
As a rule, US presidential candidates have always published their tax information, although the law does not require them to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman and his lawyer, have appealed to the tax government's review and say that Trump has not published his income data.
“The transfer is your – tweet Clinton campaign assistant, Ian Sams, a Democratic Candidate, referring to the tax information.
On Thursday, Trump's special attorney Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not let Trump publish his tax records until the inspections were complete.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members for 2012, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump's own capital, his contributions to charity, his business relations and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has caught up with this question and released a video online on Friday in which he brings up prominent Republicans who embroidery Trump to publish his tax information.
On Thursday Clinton raised the issue in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
\"Trump refuses to do what every candidate for president has been doing for decades, and not his public tax returns,\" Clinton told the crowd.
According to the Politico website, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid only a little for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times’s business group quoted several tax agents and auditors on Friday that the situation could continue to be similar.
The federal tax rates have raised the key issue of the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a billionaire investor, according to Warren Buffett, a rule that would ensure that more than one million dollars per year would pay at least 30% of the tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week at the Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, the headquarters of the Berkshire Hathaway multinational company, challenged Trump to meet where they both would disclose their tax information.
Buffet says that he has also been subject to tax control and that Trump is not afraid of tax authorities, but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Clintons, now residing in the city of Chappaqua in New York, paid a real federal tax on average by 32% between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate paid by them was around 40.5%.
Clinton's 2015 tax declaration shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their incomes were wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and Clintons announced the amount of dividend and interest income of $190,000.

Chili powder-filled bulking condoms supported by the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Natural protectors in Tanzania have invented an unusual way of keeping elephants away from human clothing – elephants are alarmed by throwing chili powder filled condoms towards them.
The work has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which was invented a few years ago, has started a campaign with the American Nature Conservancy Organization to teach the volunteers of villages in Northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and cultures without harming elephants.
A little while ago, the elephants were used for the spears.
Friday is the world’s elephant day dedicated to animal protection.
“The method we have developed has changed our attitudes in these villages, because now the villagers can rely on them to keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them,” says Damian Bell, CEO of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, the intruding elephant is ashamed of showing the flashlight and playing the horn.
If this doesn't work, we'll throw the so-called chili cloud.
The chili powder mixed with the soil is placed in a condom together with a tummy, and the head of the condom is then wrapped so that only the ignition wire is left outside.
When the ignition wire is lit, the condom explodes open and spreads a fine chili powder cloud into the air.
Usually, one spice cloud is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last means is a thrower that shoots a Roman candle in the air of a famous fireworks and creates a loud and bright explosion.
The Jewish film director criticizes the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's direct number from the Arab-Democratic framework - RT News
The French, Jewish director of the film, gave birth to the media track after the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel did not mention Israel’s direct number in its country list.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Shoah document on the Holocaust, lopped his frustration at the Berlin Kempinski Bristol by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
With his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find the hotel’s guide number list in Israel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which the room can be called directly.
“How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it did not exist –
Lanzmann wrote.
Rather, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation of the hotel’s reception.
Lanzmann writes the receptionist's response has shocked him.
The reception official said that the removal of Israel from the list was a decision carefully considered by the management of the Kempinsky hotels.
The reason behind the action was even more shocking to the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: “The vast majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel’s direct number.
Suddeutsche Zeitung's interview with Israeli German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman said the case was a great shame.
“The desire to shake us all and shock us all.
It's a shame.
And the more disgraceful it is when we take into account that we are in Germany and this is exactly this hotel chain.
No more explanations are needed.
We are waiting for the hotel to draw the right conclusions,\" the Ambassador said.
The case caused quite a response online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski hotel simply gave rise to the claims of alleged Arab customers.
“Hävetke” was said in a publication that highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue in Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel wrote that the hotel had denied the charges quickly, called a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
“Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski’s representative has never been ordered to leave Israel from the heading list.
It adds that the heading number has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber pads to protest Brazilian students
The students joined the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered together to show their minds against the reforms of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bags against protesters.
The riot began when law enforcement authorities tried to break down the student group, resulting in police using rubber bags and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration, who wanted to show their impact on government plans.
Governor Geraldo Alckmin of the state of Sao Paulo has proposed austerity measure in which nearly 100 public schools are closed and 300 000 students are placed in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on the walls, which were temporarily opposed to President Michel Temer.
The protest of the students took place only a few days after the streets were filled with protesters who supported President Dlmä Rousseff when the Senate voted for this.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
The annual trade exchange between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent since the abolition of the sanctions, says Levan Dzhagaryan, Russian ambassador.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in the business in Iran has increased since the international sanctions against Iran were abolished.
“Venical companies continue their existing relations with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
The growth of trade is, of course, one of the priorities of cooperation between countries, says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to $856 million.
Specially Russian exports to Iran quickly rose to 91.5%, to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
The trade was accelerated by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, says Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign delegation in Iran granted approximately 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
Iran was among the first 20 countries to travel to Russia for the first time.
And it is not too bold to say that the record of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year,\" he said.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
“I can personally recommend travelling to cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have kept the monuments of ancient Persia in good condition,” he said.
Scotti Callum Skinner climbed the goal of British winning cycling gold
The Scottish Callum Skinner praised the reputation of men's team prince Rio's velodorm last night, when the British trio defended the title earned in London in 2012.
Glasgow’s 23-year-old Skinner was in the role of an anchor, which he inherited from his countryman Sir Chris Hoy. The young man made a legend proud of the goal and captured the victory from the New Zealand team.
The British won a surprise four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after they had only ranked sixth in the World Championships in London in March, despite the fact that Hoy had since left his competition career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, specialising in the role of the first leader.
The price came out at just the right time.
Hoy’s decision to end the race also left a hole that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Scottish Skinner was a man whom British coaches believed and where they saw the potential he has now redeemed.
In the first round, Kenny and Skinner won the championship four years ago, but in the first round, New Zealand was faster.
And the British triad won gold in a double fight.
Hindes was very close after his round, but Kenny tried to take the team's lead position, which Skinner kept.
A large part of the change was the change of the strategy so that Hindus had time to slow down the pace with a larger gear, which enabled Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy followed him as a BBC commentator and reached the views of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the prize.
The 23-year-old Skinner, Glasgow, says: “I’m flattered by the parallel.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We did the Olympics show at the final and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After winning in London in 2012, Hindus, together with Kenny and Hoy, refused to fall on the track for a bad departure.
He later withdrew his word, and the British competitors did not have a complaint.
This time, there were no problems with sovereign victory.
Hindus says: “The dream was like London, all the British flags shone in sight.
Our team was united in the last three months.
We've lost so many world championships that the victory in the Olympics seems amazing.
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for the country, which won seven out of ten races in both Beijing and London.
If this is a meter for progress in the last five months, then five days of success in front of the veldom.
As Kenny has shown in his ability, it is not impossible to imagine that he repeats Hoy’s achievements and defeats three Olympic goldes in one of the Olympics.
This would mean an account mapping with six gold medals and one hopmedal Kenny, which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyta and was born on March 23 (the magical date of British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgraven, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
In this case, medal aids would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny will compete next in the sprint, which will start today and solve in three days.
Bolton’s 28-year-old Kenny says: “I can only rejoice at this moment.
The team competition is always the best.
You can enjoy winning together with friends.
It's a little lonely to win alone.
Hindus says, “If he wins two more gold medals, he must get the value of the knight.
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owen Doull were the fastest in the four-man team run.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record, made in London in 2012 and won gold, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (cl. 22.42) compete today on the second day of competition, and the focus of attention will certainly be Wiggins.
He had a dispute with competition agents yesterday before the time when the agents invited him to measure his length.
In a similar women's race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald, home to Milngavi, reached World Record Time 4:13.260.
The British team can now rely on its huge cycling team to take responsibility for the Olympic mid-stage and bring a number of medals to the country.
After the actual exceptional evidence from the full leadership station in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas on the background, the least of which has been the abolition of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexualism and bullying claims, and the termination of major athletes such as Hoyn and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on the first night with the indebtedness show that the UK’s already legendary reputation for rising to the top is once again realized.
The future of Portland's melting plant at stake due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium alloy in Portland, the state of Victoria, and therefore the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when the power company operating as electricity to the melting plant said that one of the owners of the plant is about to terminate the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision made earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to continue to support the plant in operation.
Fixed, 20 years of support will cease in November.
Alcoan Portland is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
As a result, up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs can be at risk.
The snowball effect can continue to increase, as the melting plant consumes about 10% of the total electricity production in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's melting plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoan Portland molten plant loses money and is in danger of closing its doors.
The measures correspond to the speculation of the future of the plant for many years, which was first caused by the strong Australian dollar and the recent production of the plant.
AGL, which delivers electricity to the large aluminium alloy plant from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says that it expects the three other owners of the melting plant to terminate their contract.
As the majority owner of the plant, Alcoa and Alumina are a joint venture, with Chinese CITIC and Japanese Maruben Corp owning minority shares in the factory.
AGL says it expects Portland’s production facility to continue to operate, which means that physical electricity demand from the melting plant continues.
AGL states that contracts are the so-called safeguard contracts that were to enter into force in November 2016.
The period of termination of contracts is 12 months, so they will end in 2017.
“Therefore, AGL expects contracts to generate revenue in the year 2017 to 2017, says the power plant.
The potential revenue impact on AGL from the year 2018 to the next year is currently limiting the strong future market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL has already reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million in advance for the termination of contracts.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts does not affect the ability of Alcoa ... to keep the melting plant functioning or to secure the supply of electricity to the melting plant.
The American company announced that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which had to enter into force since November of this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
Due to the weak economic situation in the industry, analysts have been cautious about both the melting plant in Portland, Victoria and the Tomago factory in Newcastle.
AGL’s operational director, Stephen Mikkelsen, told analysts earlier this week that, at annual level, Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
“If these plants leave the market, it means a significant drop in demand on the market (electricity).
As a producer, it wouldn’t be good news for us,” Mikkelsen says.
Kardashianit Toss TV star Kendall as a September Vogue cover girl
The model of Kardashian-Jenner and the fourth daughter of his mother and manager Krishna Kendall Jenner, 20th position in the famous September issue of the U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's ad-style and appeared on Milan, Paris, and New York fashion designers, announced the news on his Instagram account on Thursday.
“Looking at a box in a room full of my loved ones, she had me in tears,” Kendall wrote.
The publication of the cover picture was followed by a strange (or perhaps only the Kardashianite series style?), a script written by all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (barbishops Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite uncle, the producer of the Kardashianite series Ryan Seacrest) who forgot his sister's cover picture. The video ends in a classic version: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is clichical, and it is used in almost all the birthday periods of the programs (Seacrest says: “You thought that we had forgotten you – as sincere as the children’s morning-TV cartoon character) but Krisin had to get the rest of his daughter into this public somehow.
It is the appearance of Vogue in the September issue of the New Age of the Kardashians.
Kendal's isososko Kim may have filed a case for Vogue before (it was performed in Vogue's cover with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite his own class.
The number of September is Vogue’s most sold edition of the year.
The number that resembles a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (a fashion site from Fashion fell to 615 pages of advertising on the 832 page of last year).
The publication of the September number is expected to be so intense that in the last two years, the pictures of the magazine have leaked to the public before the official announcement.
Previously as a cover model in September, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangeligel, and Kate Moss have been.
In recent years, the cover has been more famous than models that are famous for the model.
The Oscar winner and Dior-advertiser Jennifer Lawrence were in the cover film in 2013, and a year later, Lady Gaga was honoured.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for his generation, and even if he is one of the most well-known celebrities of the model, he is in a rather good company.
These celebrities are not known for people's relatives, real-TV stars, or modern children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (though Jenner is all of them).
They can rightly be called talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry more than others.
Last year, Beyoncé has one of the strongest years of her career, when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Because of his real-TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be tunic.
In June, the original model of Victoria's Secret, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them \"weapon.\"
These feelings have retangled the surface when the news of Jenner's performance on the Vogue's cover came out.
However, the continued lack of satisfaction seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is a cover image model for Vogue's September issue.
He's a super model in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking on Marc Jacobs' fashion screens.
He's an advertising street for Estee Lauder's makeup.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid applications.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which he described for the LIVE magazine.
And in his leisure time, he appears on real-TV, perhaps just as a way to meet his sister and his children.
Legal aid centres turn out 160,000 people per year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people in the country are removed from justice centres each year, and the sector is prepared for the impact that additional cuts in appropriations will already have on the centres at the border.
In Queensland, free legal aid and legal services are being turned away from five people – the majority of them are old people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified tortures and similar unfairities against people fighting resources.
Public legal aid services, whose work burden has already been overburdened, are preparing for additional cuts in the appropriations.
As of June, legal aid centres are at risk of losing 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, reports that thousands of people are being displaced every year according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Legal Assistance Centre.
If the federal government does not round its decision, Farrell said the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s public justice centres are constantly under-funded, which means that thousands of people will be turned away when seeking the necessary services,” Farrell said.
“People, people under an uncontrolled and depraved burden of debt, families with a divorce, workers who are unduly fired – all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to cope with complex legal problems without help.
We appeal to the Chancellor of Justice and Senator George Brands of Queensland to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal assistance they need.
Last year, the State Government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of the public justice centres and their customers, and the government of Palaszczzzzuk must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was brought up against the threat of a worker with a gun.
New York: A lawsuit against Donald Trump’s campaign was raised when no action was expected to be taken after it had been told to the head of the campaign that the North Carolina leader had threatened the employee with a gun in their drive to Jeep in February.
The case is described in an action brought by former software trainer Vincent Bordi, on Wednesday at the State Court in Charlotte.
For months, he said that the situation would be dealt with internally before, according to his own words, he realized that this would not happen.
In his complaint, the campaign manager, Earl Phillip, pointed out the pistol, put his right finger on the trigger, and pushed the pipe to Vincent's knee-lute.
According to the complaint, after the complaint was made to the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini was informed that at least four other people had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
“While the gun doesn’t fire, it’s causing damage,” he says.
The complaint will only come two days after the Republican presidential candidate gave rise to a general rage when he told the crowd in North Carolina that “the supporters of the second extra-position – who are considered to be the gunkeepers and gunmen – can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and can be elected by the judges.
Trump’s campaign staff said the media removed his word from his context and Trump did not encourage violence in his words.
When it comes to the campaign, the President calls for compensation for the inviolability of the campaign and Phillip for the abuse, abuse and mental suffering caused by the campaign.
Trump's spokesman Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to a message asking for a comment.
Phillip was not targeted despite his attempts.
Charlotte's local news agency WCCB recently announced Phillip's campaign.
Innovative Consulting Services, Phillip’s consulting company, no immediate response was received.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been conducting a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates prosperity – not only in local communities and London, but in the whole country.
For me, this was the one that was most interested in Heathrow. As at the London Olympics in 2012, we invested enormously in the benefit of our entire nation and all our regions.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and East End.
We do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses close to Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs, removing youth unemployment in the surrounding areas of the airport.
As in London’s Olympics in 2012, there are always people who believe that Heathrow’s expansion is too much a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I learned that Britain will never be ready for them and that in the eyes of the rest of the world we will face an awkward situation.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
The obstacles that can be overcome will always be answered, but Heathrow will answer every question asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits a few instead of a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and increase the economy by 211 billion pounds, bringing knowledge and employment to both the airport’s environment and the UK as a whole.
At Heathrow, we have a great team that has implemented and remained in the budget with a 11 billion-dollar infrastructure investment programme, which included a T5 terminal, which has been voted for the best flight terminal of the year in two consecutive years – and a T2 terminal built in the middle of two world’s most crowded runways.
They are now ready to produce third runways, supported by a private investment of £16 billion.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an expansion of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit for the expansion of Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the skills and employment that the UK can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the Government of Heathrow and the former Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Advertising in Cat Mouse
The efforts of companies who earn their money from online advertising have become a cat mouse game, says one of the companies that produce prevention programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook had announced on its own page that it would block advertising programs, Adblock Plus released a blog writing where it said users could update their blockware filters and thus stop advertising of the community service again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the advertising code of its desktop site so that it is more difficult to identify advertising programs, which parts of the page are advertisements.
But now, Adblock says he's found out the new codes.
Ben Williams, a journalist at Adblock, wrote in his blog that “a kind of balling between an open source advertising community and the dissidents has been running ever since an ad-promotion was invented, and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repair movement again.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has participated in the fight is a strong indication of the concern that advertisers have become in the industry.
About 200 million people worldwide use promotional programs, says a study conducted by Pagefair and Adobe last year. The figure has almost quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users daily on mobile devices, and mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company intends to contribute to the misappropriation of promotional programs in its desktop application, as according to the advertiser, mobile image prevention programs do not work on Facebook’s mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from Desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered to be profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also announced that it would update the user settings advertising tool so that users can control more how advertisements are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticizes Adblock’s new filters, as it also prevents some of the usual Facebook records from being visible.
“This is not a good experience for users, and we’re going to solve the problem,” said Facebook’s messenger in his email.
“Advertising programmes are clumsy and ineffective, and that’s why we have instead invested in developing user settings such as advertising tools so that people can control the allocation of advertisements themselves.
A woman committed suicide by leaving her cars under the Swiss highway
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking for the help of witnesses on the highway in the first hours of the accident on Thursday, where the woman intentionally left under more cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in Vaud's canton near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate act by lying on the dark road, and more cars hit her, says Vaud's police officer.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and his effort was clearly to commit suicide. Among the overpowered cars was also a truck.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unidentified. The police are asking them or other witnesses of the accident to report.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter says in Le Tribune de Geneve that criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a logical step in this kind of situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether the charges against the drivers involved in the accident will be raised.
Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
It's going to be settled by the prosecutor, says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, two similar cases have occurred that do not make drivers responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases the person walked on the dark highway, and the court decided that the drivers could not wait for him to run on a pedestrian highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police was released from the charge that had been brought up against him after he collided with a man who lay on the A1 highway near Paynerne one of August night in 2014.
The court heard that a 22-year-old victim had enjoyed a lot of alcohol and left the road.
The court found that the police, which was in response to the emergency attack, were justified and the man lying on the road was a very exceptional and unpredictable situation.
Any accident near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police number 021 644 83 46 or 020 644 44 44.
NASA’s climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study Venus’s past with the same tools and algorithms as climate scientists use.
The model was intended to determine whether the conditions in Venus were sometimes similar to those on earth, although Venus is hot and waterless and its gas cycle is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide.
According to previous presentations, Venus’s slow rotation speed is explained in its thick atmosphere.
However, based on the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere similar to the Earth and has, nevertheless, run slowly.
The model was also used to determine the surface formation of the early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variations to maintain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent darker.
“In GISS’s modeling Venus is slowly spinning and its side is almost two months per sun,\" says the GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in the press release.
This warms the surface and generates rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer acts like a umbrella and protects the surface from a large part of the solar heat.
As a result, the average temperature of the climate is up to a few degrees lower than the current temperatures of the Earth.
The model created Venus’s story, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of the planetary scientists about its development.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans faded, and the ultraviolet cloud burned the steamed water.
When the hydrogen was running into space, there was only a thick carbon dioxide gas frame and a deadly greenhouse effect – i.e. Venus, as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus weather model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche's coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as a coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as the Vice President of the Society’s ice hockey activities, he appealed to the lack of opportunities for the team’s decision-making.
Joe Sakic, Vice-President of Colorado, confirmed the news and announced that the club will immediately begin to apply for a new coach.
“For the last three years, I’ve been the head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as the vice president of the club’s ice hockey activities vigorously, passionately and determinedly,” says Roy, a 50-year-old.
“I’ve been thinking for a long and hard time over the summer about how I could improve the team, give it the desired depth and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the Vice-President of the coach and association’s ice hockey activities must be fully in line with the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not fulfilled at the moment.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
\"Patrick told me he decided today,\" Sakic says.
“We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him everything good for the future.”
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach for the past year in his first season as Avalanche’s head coach 2013-2014.
With his lead, the club reached 112 points and won the middle division, but Colorado lost in Minnesota's drop-off games and hasn't reached the sequel in the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points during the 2015-2016 period and remained five points at the head of Minnesota Wild when playing from the second Wild Card in the Western conference.
Hall of Fame painter Roy won four Stanley Cupes in the Montreal Canadiens lines and two in the Avalanchen lines.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and suspend the strike
The chief advisors say that the oily wage laws of the North Sea will be interrupted when all parties to the dispute take part in a new round of negotiations.
The Wood Group, which offers oil-field services, has been held with drill trucks in the North Sea, managed by Royal Dutch Shell.
According to the Joint Declaration of the Parties, \"Wood Group and Trade Unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to restart the process in order to resolve the dispute\"
From the beginning of the week, we will have several full-day meetings for the next few weeks, where we will deal with problems with fresh aspects.
The trade unions set the ground for their recent activities, which, according to them, were the first to be more than 25 years, as a protest to possible 30% of wage cuts.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group cuts around 9 per cent of the tariffs for its contractors in the North Sea this year.
The reduction of the company tariffs is consistent with the reduction of the prices of contractors working in the countries by 10% in 20114.
According to the company, further cuts give it the space necessary to find out about the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut off thousands of employees and announced its plans to leave oil and gas drilling activities in up to 10 countries, thus seeking to enhance its operations with the British energy company BG Group after its mega fusion.
The lower prices of crude oil and the economic situation resulting from the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union in June will create pressure on energy companies.
Mr Dave Anderson met with Labour Leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work reports that the North Sea has experienced for the entire generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the economy of the region.
“In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need a economy that is of interest to many, not just a few,” Anderson said.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to be used in 2016 at less than $1.4 billion, while around $7 billion has been spent in the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the star cluster of Plejajads
The newest task of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the speed of star rotation, which has helped astronomers to gather the most comprehensive list of the speeds of rotation of stars in the Plejajad constellation.
Based on new data, astronomers are able to determine why the stars of the same star cluster rotate at different speeds and how the rotation times relate to the planet formation.
“We hope that by comparing the results to other star groups, we will learn more about the relationship between weight and age and even its history of the solar system,” says Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the University of Caltech in the press release for infrared treatment and analysis at the University of Pasadena.
The star cluster of the Plejajads is located 445 light-years from the Earth.
Many stars have been born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching their adult age.
They are running faster now than ever.
When the speed of rotation is peaked, large amounts of stars will be released from the star wind.
These winds have a brake effect on the stars as they advance through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, the speed of its rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by following the time between the appearance of the detectable star clouds (which correspond to the solar clouds).
The latest chart speed data suggest that larger stars spin slower than smaller ones.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers – the larger spins slower than the smaller.
“We see the Plejajai dance – that the slow spins are typically bigger, while the fastest spins are typically very light stars,” Rebull said.
Since the star cluster of Plejajads is so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory to compare the characteristics of the stars to the speeds of rotation.
“Plejajajai’s star group offers a support pilot for the theoretical models of the rotation of both younger and older stars,” Rebull said.
We want to learn more about how, when and why the stars slow down their rotational speed and stop their dances.
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of Plejajajai’s rotational speeds in three new articles that will be published soon in the Astronomic Journal.
