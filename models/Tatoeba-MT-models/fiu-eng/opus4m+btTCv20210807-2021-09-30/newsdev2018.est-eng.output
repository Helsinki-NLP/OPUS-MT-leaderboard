Two influential women share the secrets of their success
What's in common with Barbara Corcoran and Laila Ali?
At first glance, these women come from two completely different worlds.
Barbara Corcoran was able to convert a $1,000 loan into five billion worth of real estate before implementing his expertise in a television screen, participating in the ABC Reality Series \"Shark Tank\" in the investor panel.
Laila Ali has been following his father by becoming the most successful female champion as a four-time unstable champion before adding the roles of the TV host, author and speaker to his resume.
Despite their unique career paths (or perhaps because of them), TJ Maxx, however, recruited both women to help them speak to full hopeful entrepreneurs about breaking stereotypes and achieving high-flying goals.
Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in stores across the country and discovered that 80 percent of them felt that society had set them stereotypically solid roles and expectations.
As a result, they came out with the project The Maxx You Project to help women break these barriers.
Corcoron and Ali know a lot about it, but they may have been at the top of their field by now, but the journey was not smooth for either of them.
Corcoran received a score in high school and college mainly from Ds and had worked at 20 jobs when he was 23 years old.
Ali entered one of the most man-centered areas, and in addition, he stood in front of him the challenge of trying to step out of the shadow of his father, who was the icon of the world.
These two softly pack through the knowledge of difficulties.
That’s why we sat down with these influential women to talk about overcoming failures, coping with success and trusting our stomach feelings in business and relationships.
What inspires you to do what you do every day?
Laila Ali: I am inspired by my personal goals every day.
I have designed the habit of writing up the things I want to achieve.
And I'll look at this list.
I think I'm responsible.
Of course, my kids inspire me.
My ambitions inspire me.
I want to be a winner in everything I do in my life.
I understand that achieving my goals requires hard work, but I am ready to do so.
My self-confidence is due to preparation.
So I spend a lot of time preparing.
Barbara Corcoran: Like Lailal, my self-confidence is the key to being prepared too much, but I do not draw my inspiration from it.
In fact, it offers me inspirational curiosity.
What happens if I do?
What happens if I don't do it?
This curiosity makes me get out of bed in the morning, because I can’t wait to see what day brings me.
If I don’t feel that way in a few days, I just pretend to feel that way.
Then I’m going to believe in myself, and I’m going to get inspired again.
Talk about some obstacles to your career, which made you better in the long run.
Barbara Corcoran: It was the hardest thing for me when my business partner loved me and married my secretary.
I finished my business a year later, but this year of my life - being the fifth wheel - was terrible, because I didn't have enough confidence to leave.
I felt defeated, there was no inspiration.
But amazing things happen.
The hardest thing is to believe in this moment when you get hit by a blow.
The year of driving and starting business again from scratch - this time without a partner - was extremely difficult.
Laila Ali: I would say that the hardest time in my career was when I was doing boxing, I was at the top of my career, and I decided to give in the divorce.
I didn’t separate myself from my husband, but also from that manager and the person who taught me everything I know about boxing.
I didn't think I could handle it without him.
So I began to worry about the future of my career, and I had to find time to step back and say to myself: “You have all the knowledge and experience you need.
You have all these experiences in the box.
You can definitely do that.
So I formed a new team around me and continued my career.
In fact, it was just necessary to achieve the right state of mind, because all the rest of it got a boost from there.
I did what I had to do, I had to face fear and find the courage to get rid of my husband and manager and continue my career.
When did you feel that you were really successful?
Laila Ali: I felt I was successful when I won my first championship title.
It was a really good feeling, because, starting with boxing, I wanted to be one of the best, to be unbeatable.
I was able to achieve this goal, and I won the title of the championship not one, but four times.
Barbara Corcoran: One moment I felt I had achieved success was my eleventh year of operation.
I finally got a profit.
I had earned a profit of about $42,000, which I could not expect.
I went out right now and bought a new car for both mom and dad, and they never had a new car, and I let them deliver cars to Florida, where they kept their retirement.
I felt like the Queen of England.
I felt so cool.
I made much more of it in the years to come, but nothing has been able to offer an equivalent feeling than a chance to give something back to my parents and take them with surprise.
How were you able to keep yourself motivated during this 11-year period to continue working?
Barbara Corcoran: I never measured my business by profit because it wasn’t my goal.
I just wanted to see how far I could reach.
On the first day, I had a dream of becoming a New York Real Estate King.
And I saw myself in the eyes of the spirit as a Pope, all kissing my ring and worshiping me.
There was such a small thought in my head.
So when I kept trying every day, every hour, I didn’t really think about making money.
Finally, I accidentally earned the money.
But all the money that came in, I just went back to business.
I don't even think that I had a lot of days to think that oh God, we don't make money.
I was just convinced that something was going to work.
The worst thing that could have happened would have been the loss of the company and the reinstatement.
So I made a good drink, and I was happy.
I could be happy again.
Therefore, I do not believe that a great deal of people’s success is money.
They have other motives that encourage them.
And the money wasn't one of mine.
Do you have any advice for someone who has such great dreams, but who is holding back a financial factor?
Barbara Corcoran: When I started earning a lot of money, I had money to invest in real estate, but I didn’t have time.
I've limited the company.
And that's why I found five different partners who were not even specialists in the brokerage, but in different neighborhoods all over the city who felt their streets through and broke.
I approached them and said, \"You know this neighborhood.
Find the best building for me.
I'll give you the money and you'll be my partner.
The lesson here is that if you have money, you need people to make money with your money.
And if you have talent, you can sell it to someone who has money and make money with it.
Here are two things: talent and money.
But if you're not together, nothing's going to happen very much.
After all, I - and my partners - have gone very well together with the great investors I would never have had if I had no courage to find the fighting-loving people who like to take a step.
You can always get money if you believe you have talent and feel better than anyone else in the world.
What are the two or three things you do every morning to help you succeed?
Laila Ali: I don't know about you, but I have a lot of moments in my life when I feel overburdened, being a mother, a business wife, a husband... all the roles we play as women.
I reached a point in my life where I really had to put the morning routine in place.
I like to get up and just feel grateful.
Resurrection, your health, your children, your family.
I often write up at night, which is my goal for the next day. When I wake up, I will look at this list again.
Meditating.
Sometimes I write to the diary.
I always drink a cup of coffee.
And I'm always doing the first thing in the morning, because if I don't do it then it won't be done.
This is ultimately a priority for me.
These are things that are important to me: my spirituality, my focus on the universe and God, then training and putting my health first.
Because of this, everything else seems easy.
I feel like I can conquer all the challenges I face in the day.
Barbara Corcoran: I put things in order.
I work through a list of my tasks, which is endless and ridiculous.
And I'll put what's most important.
What are the real priorities?
I am trying to accept the most important things.
What are you doing to bring yourself to the right state of mind for a big meeting?
Barbara Corcoran: I think I'm going to fail.
It's as weird as it isn't.
I think, my God, I'm failing.
I'm scared of myself, and it makes me more effort.
I imagine anyone who competes with me – I’m naturally very passionate about fighting because I’m one of ten children and we never got enough attention from our parents.
I can be very competitive.
And I always come too thoroughly prepared.
Excessive preparation strengthens my confidence.
Lalala Ali: Amazing when we are opposed to this.
We are two successful people and it shows how different things work for different people.
I like to think I'm successful.
I like to think about the end of what success is.
I imagine it in my mind, I actually see it happening.
I see a boxing, a fight, a belt-winner, and a dressing room back, celebrating a victory with a piece of cake, as I have always done.
The same applies to meetings.
However, I always prepare myself thoroughly, and this confidence comes from the preparation, because there is fear that I will not go well or I will not say the right things or do not have the necessary information.
Here comes the game preparation for me.
But I always get the final result by visualizing.
You both have been very successful in your career.
How do you pass it on?
Lalala Ali: I’m very excited to be part of the T.J. Maxx project Maxx You Project, because I feel it’s a way to do good.
Many women need inspiration, encouragement to pursue their dreams and goals.
We all have a champion.
It’s actually a matter of thinking and having the tools you need, surrounded by the right people, people who have been able to achieve the things you’re trying to achieve.
Barbara Corcoran: One thing I do very well in my opinion is the inspiration of people.
That’s why I was very excited when I was asked to cooperate with Maxx You Project.
I am trying to light up the flame of individuality and inspiration that we see here in the faces of all these people, and to give them practical advice on how to move forward.
Many people start their dreams, but tend to get lost in some point.
So we try to help them focus on the purpose.
Everything we teach is practical.
Business planning, even as simple as an elevator call, is all you need to create a company.
What advice would you give to women who want to succeed in men-centered areas?
Laila Ali: I act in one of the most man-centered areas, which is boxing.
To come after his father, who was the universal icon and the best of all time, was quite exhausting.
For me, the core of the thing was actually about finding its talent, courage, strength in itself.
The first thing I had to do was believe in myself that I could take a box and be successful.
At that time, no one else except me and I had no restrictions on what I had set myself in my head.
If you believe in yourself and find your passion, no one can stop you.
Barbara Corcoran: The journey between finding inspiration and having a attitude like me – the New York Real Estate Queen – and crossing the finish line is enormously long.
And in this interim phase, which is every day in your career, you need a lot of talents.
To need these gifts, you don’t have to act with real estate.
I am sure that there was also a need to decide what are the right people, the right managers, when to start, when to stop, how much money you have, what can be put in, what is not, how hard you are ready to work.
These are all subjective decisions.
I try to make these efforts a little more authentic so that these women really feel: “Okay, I get it now.
Let me try.
Here are my three priorities:
When they leave with three main priorities to make things really happen, I go to bed with a smile at home tonight.
What's on your night screen right now?
Lalaa Ali: Too much crap.
Journals, books, little prayer, my diary.
Probably a bottle of water.
Barbara Corcoran: I have a small green alarm clock on my nightstand, because I tried to break the habit every morning as a first thing to watch the phone.
That's why I got it.
That was cute.
But it never worked.
And he's still standing there.
And my phone's still in my room.
What book are you reading right now?
Barbara Corcoran: Eight or nine times, “How to Win Friends and Affect People”
It keeps me on the right track.
I think this is still the best book written in this area, no matter what your dreams are. Dreams cannot be achieved without other people.
And it is possible to communicate in the same way as in the past today.
I like reading it from time to time.
This will help me get back on the right track.
Laila Ali: I’m studying at the nutrition school, which is why I’m reading the book “Food-free diet”
It is about eating cereals and how they affect our body.
It's very interesting to me.
What is your best advice to cope with successes and failures?
Barbara Corcoran: Ignore the plagues.
They meet in all kinds of shapes.
You need to remove them from the vocabulary of your brain.
Stay away from the pilgrims.
They suck you out of energy.
I'm in a relationship with pilgrims as a thief.
They come at night, pick up your wallet and leave.
Pessimists destroy a team faster than you can look at, because people who pity themselves want others to feel bad too.
They pull good people into the hole with themselves.
I can perfectly avoid all the negative people in my 50 km radius, because my goal is to be positive and take from life everything that gives me, and to accept everything I have to offer.
So why would I want to spend a minute or two on such people?
Laila Ali: Must be consistent.
Let’s start many times with confidence that we will now take this path.
Let's do this, this and this.
But people don’t follow it long enough.
Sometimes they give up just before they cross the last hill.
So I think it's necessary to stay on the course.
If you feel passionate about something, believe in something, you need to be consistent.
And you have to do the hard work that success requires.
Barbara Corcoran: A lot of work needs to be done to ensure consistency.
Do you know what it takes to do?
End of things.
If you start something, stop it.
Many are skilled beginners, but not particularly skilled graduates.
In Latvia, the most non-citizens live in Daugavpis, Riga and Liepaja.
In Riga there are 125,344, in Daugavpis 14,266 and in Liepāja 11 909.
Outside the large city, the most people without Latvian citizenship live in Yekabpis (2347) and Valmiera (1235).
At the beginning of 2017, 242 560 people lived in Latvia who did not have Latvian citizenship.
In 2007, 392 816 non-EU residents lived in Latvia.
Jürgen Ligi recently referred to Facebook: “This is a poor justification.
That is why I am not going to look back and try not to recall what has been done in history to reproduce human nature and what results have been achieved.
I do not give an assessment of whether these attempts can be considered successful or unsuccessful.
I also avoided excessive source links, although I rely on the idea of my most important teacher, Toomas Paul: all my thoughts are borrowed from somewhere, if only remember where exactly.
The most striking activity in Estonia today is the regrowing of Estonian Republican citizens - a perfect human being.
We don't raise him, as we raise a child, in good faith, that he becomes a human being.
We are raising him as the ruling class represents it itself - which one person must be able to live and speak publicly in Estonia.
Censorship is perfect.
Although the local ruling class changed partly a year ago, some methods of cultivation are as frightening as those of the previous ruling class, the now degraded nobles - their brutality does not fall to the least of the previous ones.
They're just different.
Latvian beer is a brandy drink for the new era.
0.5 promillis for Heads of State
The dominant class includes not only those politicians who get a salary from the state for their work, but also those self-conscious who make politics voluntarily (read: intentionally): writing the image of Mihkel Mut by using opinions, fighting on Facebook, when the terrible people around them live, imitate, boycott, chonglerize, sabotage.
They are only willing to stay in the Echo Chamber (the English expression of people living in a room where there are only relevant opinions, such as their own Facebook friends, etc.), but in conflict in Estonia it is not possible.
Still, there are some fellow travelers who think or do something that is unbearable to the people of the sorceress.
And the word war is open, and the alarmers are suffocating.
We have a lot of politicians who know exactly how many people can drink with whom to sleep, several children to feed, how to work, a lot of wages to get paid when to rest, what to think, how to eat, how to split the mind, when to get sick, how to die.
In very important places.
If their public speeches are accepted by something other than what they themselves said, they are angry, offended, hysterical.
The fact that people in many European countries, “full-headed” driving a car, and this is legally permitted, does not shake their opinion.
Nulltolerance is the only tolerance allowed in every field, but behind zero tolerance is not the care, but the penitentiary.
Classic hatred and racism - only people like me are good.
Holy politicians can only open their mouth, but never the heart.
They believe that every “measure” they make a better society works and is worth trying.
Fortunately for them, we have a sufficient size of cardiards under the brilliant attention of the claques, with the mental disability of the cascara, who jump through every window without feeling the pain.
That's why it seems to us that some clever peasant opens his mouth and he's emotionally beaten up to make it sound reasonable.
Some words that will certainly send us to the mansion are, for example, gay, refugee, woman, violence, work, etc.
If you believe everything that self-sacrificing officials, activists and politicians (only a small part of all groups, but they are able to rob the entire society) speak and write, the citizen is not only a detestable, vulgar, and unpleasant, but also a brainless, without brainless.
But do not believe, do not tolerate, do not deny drinking.
In any case, the Estonian man drinks as much as he wants, not as much as the state promises.
In any case, the Estonian man will tolerate more than he is not forced to tolerate.
The Estonian person does not change his behavior two months before the elections, so that after reaching the goal, his popularity is turned on and again from the mouth not only in itself, but also expel what is unpleasant about the brain fat pounds quickly restores.
Anyone who does otherwise is not the right Estonian.
I don’t think any people can be rearranged.
I believe that a person can be taught.
Drink wisely, love your family, be a workful, polite, attractive companion not only for friends, but for society as a whole.
To teach, it is not always necessary to punish, limit, prohibit, force, call, put on the corner, throw up with rot eggs in media shame mail.
The teacher must be an example.
Is the Smoking politician talking about tobacco harm?
Is the police who are crossing speed in free time punishing me for overcoming speed?
And then a colleague with a good head...
I have such a keen idea that maybe we should try to re-elevate the dominant class.
Tell them not to drink secret.
When you drink, drink openly: in the palace of Raekoja, under the eyes of all the people.
To force the speed to exceed the speed only in public - the cars of the rulers, including private cars, be all red.
If you rule, rule as you rule yourself.
Perhaps shame is enough if words and actions do not come together.
Or we know that we want us to rule the most fasting ones.
Because all of us, Estonians, are what we do not want to be at all.
Where to escape yourself?
Trump's transcription is probably a federal crime, according to former prosecutors.
The person who leaked the phone calls between President Trump and foreign leaders to the press was likely to commit a crime, the former prosecutors argued Thursday when the legislators called for a call to find out the eater.
“The unauthorized disclosure of these documents to the press is a crime,” former Columbia District Attorney Joe diGenova Fox News said.
These various acts, which include the disclosure of the notes of the conversations between the President and foreign leaders and their transcripts, pose a serious threat to national security.
Based on the leaked documents, the Washington Post announced Thursday the new details of the intense talks that took place at the end of January with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
In the first place, Trump told the Mexican Head of State to stop declaring that his government would not pay for the border wall.
According to the newspaper, transcripts contained notes indicating that the Head of the National Security Council has encrypted them.
The Post said that they had received comprehensive transcripts, which had been “accompanies of the White House” and were based on the records of the White House notebooks.
“There is a federal decree that makes such classified information leaking to an unauthorised person a crime, a federal crime,” said the former New York Public Prosecutor Doug Burns in a telephone interview.
Although some of the details of these calls came to the public already in February, the disclosure of transcripts notes a much greater blow to the White House, who is trying to reduce the leaks.
The report was published randomly at a time when Trump’s administrators were preparing on Friday to make a strong public effort to show their commitment to the discovery of the leakers of classified information.
Prosecutor-General Jeff Sessions, National Intelligence Director Dan Coats, Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, and Head of National Counterfeit and Security Centre William Evanina is expected to take a public course at the Justice Department headquarters.
It is not clear whether the Justice Department is investigating The Post's leak.
In order to be held accountable for this, Burns said that “reliable elements must be clearly proven”
He said that, “it may be possible to come up with a flat-screen, referring to the investigation and decision of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
These considerations include the labelling and history of the document and its precise classification.
In case of secrecy, prosecutors will investigate whether the document was leaked to an unauthorised person in a way that negatively affects the interests of the United States.
“When all this can be proved, people can undoubtedly be unprotected in a criminal situation,” Burns said.
\"There is no doubt...
Speaking of Trump’s phone calls transcripts, DiGenova, who was the prosecutor of spying cases, said that such documents are “usually classified as a secret and above”
By claiming that these leaks threaten the ability of the United States government to conduct foreign policy, DiGenova asked the chief prosecutor to call together a federal criminal jury to find the leakers.
He also said that in order to obtain records of The Washington Post's reporters and editors' telephone calls, a court order should be made - something that reporters would undoubtedly protest against.
Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee said Thursday at Capitol Hill that criminal proceedings should take place in case of leaking classified information.
“There will be a man who leaked them – he must be punished, and he must be fired,” said Lee Fox News on “America News HQ”
“This is unacceptable and such a thing should never happen.”
Lee, who worked as a lawyer before he was elected to the Senate in 2010, said that such a leak was a “crime, a very serious federal crime”
“This action should not only be accompanied by dismissal, but also by criminal proceedings, given the involvement of classified information,” he said.
Fox News was told that at this stage, the Ministry of Justice’s Friday announcement could give an overview of what the Ministry of Justice is hoping to achieve, rather than explain certain procedures.
Last week, President Sessions criticized and publicly poured out his anger on the chief prosecutor, claiming that the latter had not made enough effort to find the leakers.
“I want the chief prosecutor to be a lot tougher about the leaks that come from the security agencies,” Trump said on July 25 in the rosary.
The session itself admitted to Fox News Tucker Carlson last week that he is not satisfied with the leaks that have repeatedly made obstacles to his inauguration with efforts to investigate.
“I have not been satisfied with previous procedures and investigations of criminal leaks,” said Sessions.
Even some people who are critical of the president have spoken against the leaks, saying that such an act is detrimental to foreign policy aspirations.
“The leaking of the call between the president and the foreign leader is unprecedented, shocking and dangerous,” David Frum wrote on Thursday, Atlanticus.
“It is extremely important that the president can communicate confidentially – and perhaps even more importantly, that foreign leaders understand that they can respond confidentially.”
Senator Mark Warner (D-Va), the Senate Security Committee’s Democratic Party, also told The Daily Beast that the leak was “absolutely, alarming, and Congress should investigate it.
10 Advertising Tricks that Make the Food look more attractive
Since many foods are difficult to photograph, the picture uses a different ingredient that people betray - for example, instead of milk, instead of glue or ice cream, potatoes.
The Youtube Channel Top Training provides an overview of what tricks are quite common in the advertising world.
If someone opens a popcorn package in the ad or takes out a hamburger from the box, a lot of nice steam is pouring out of it.
In reality, the technique is longer and the whole period of hot food is not aura, because the steam comes from a large water content, which, for example, the products of the plant do not have.
Therefore, cotton balls in the water placed in the packaging or in the food, which have the ability to absorb and keep their own water.
Near the heat exchange, they are much longer than a burger or popcorn, and the product has a freshly prepared look.
The potato bottler is a great assistant to photographers, because it does not begin to melt in the hands of light or heat or significantly change consistency like many other foods.
For example, instead of a cream filling or ice-cold ice cream, the cake can be a potato bottle.
Few colors and decorative elements, and the consumer has been deceived again.
The glue replaces the milk.
It is not easy to photograph the milk, because it may not look so white on the photo.
Food served with milk will also quickly become bloated inside it.
For example, since breakfast cereals or mysli have to look crispy and delicious inside the milk, the glue is used instead of milk, from which no pearl passes through.
If restaurants can have a lot of trouble making meat so that the result is juicy and still ripe, then it is not done by advertising.
However, the meat presented in the ad looks particularly attractive, as if it came directly from the barbecue.
However, it is often fried on a ready-made pan or is made in a oven and the strips that imitate barbecue are drawn to the meat with a shoe foam.
It’s as difficult to work with cream as ice cream, because it tends to melt.
Fortunately, there is a product that is almost identical to the whipped cream - the foaming foam.
Thus, it can be in advertising on cakes or berries or in milk cocktails.
Even on the top of the fruits sold in the store, there can be a thin wax layer that makes their appearance brighter.
For the photo, however, this is not enough, and a deodorant is sprayed on it to add fruit to the fruit.
They are also not very photogenic, because in time they become more liquid or are separated from water, for example.
Here, however, comes the help of wax, with bright colors and a more permanent texture that allows to make an attractive image of appetite.
Wax is also likely to have been used in images where chocolate flows on cake or ice cream.
If you notice a cake with an ideal cut in advertising, where the ratio between biscivitis and bulk is ideal, some additional layers or pieces of paprika are probably used there.
This is because by cutting off the cake, the filling can spread and spoil the picture.
If, after cutting, push in the cakes and spray them over the filling, it will visually leave a much more beautiful impression.
The priest and the button needle are also used inside the burger, so that all the ingredients in there can be placed precisely in order to keep them perfectly still.
That’s why the burger doesn’t look like it in advertising.
Paper full-stop chicken.
Advertising looks like an oven-like juiced and bulky, but it may not even be ready to bake.
To add the impression of the filler, the chicken is packed with a full paper, if necessary sanded with the potato bottle mentioned before, and then sprayed the chicken with just brown color.
Pancakes are especially expensive in American ads with foam syrup, because this picture creates a large pan-coagic content in humans.
In fact, the cakes quickly absorb the syrup into themselves, and the flow of syrup quickly disappears from under the eye of the photographer.
Therefore, each pancake is sprayed with a detergent for a sofa, which helps to avoid rapid absorption.
It is often not helpful, and thus the help will be taken of gold brown motor oil, which will be poured on warm pancakes and presented as syrup.
The former soldier was sentenced to imprisonment for the murder of a retired business suspected of sexual abuse.
The former soldier was sentenced to at least 17 years in prison for the murder of a man he suspected of being abused by a familiar woman.
Richard Cassidy (70) was convicted of the murder of David Farishi (75) at the High Court of Glasgow in June 2016 at the Tweedbanks Roxburghshire in February 2016.
The judge, Lord Summers, called the murder “especially brutal” because the victim had 14 stab wounds in his body.
Brian McConnachie, a defense adviser, said that the killing was caused by “the temporary madness,” but he described the circumstances as “extraordinary”
Cassidy heard that Farish had been sexually abused for a long time.
His lawyer said he went home to Farish, and “friended,” hoping to hear a confession with him, not to kill him.
Lord Summers claimed that Cassidy showed signs of intent on the day of the attack, and showed a social work report that revealed that the meals had been trained in the military by special forces on how to embroidery groups.
There were no charges against Farish.
The court reported that after the murder, Cassidy contacted the police himself and gave up.
McConnachie said that most people have “hard to understand” that Cassidy is capable of murder.
The lawyer said: “It has never been a problem before.
He lived a life of full value until this moment of madness in February 2016.
Cassidy’s health is supposed to be poor and has been hit by a heart attack and stroke.
According to Lord Summers, he took a minimum of 17 years of imprisonment when he was sentenced to life, taking into account that Cassidy had no previous convictions, and what he was allegedly told about Farish.
The Scottish police described the case as “a particularly painful murder in his own home in the old age of a fragile man.”
Researcher David Pinkney said: “Although this punishment does not change his cruel act, I hope it will offer David’s family a solution of any kind.”
On Monday, it was the last opportunity to propose a nice name for a nose-to-mouth bracelet born at the beginning of June.
The great box now has names to look at to find the right thing to celebrate on the birthday of the zoo on August 25th.
However, the name can be offered to Naratsapoeg until the day of the resumption.
From the beginning of August, you will see a whole family of noses walking at the same time in the courtyard garden.
And while Dad Kigoma often runs around and moves around with horns, her mother does not let Kibibi bother herself, but her nose-to-mouth is worth a lesson.
Although the height of the births is over, on August 1, you saw the light of the air and the two branches of the house for him.
On the summer day of the flower hill, the eagles may be caught in the rainy eagles.
In the takines, in the peculiar appearance of the goats, the running time began.
On Thursday, another Vivacolor color day took place in the zoo.
A large number of good helpers painted a new camel house, a large courtyard garden for mothers, and a view terrace for the father-in-law.
In order not to interfere with the dyes, the mother-in-laws Fien and Dray again spent time with the father-in-law Carl.
On August 9, Aavo Otsa’s tropical ensemble will be present on the second third day of the zoo.
From the zoo, you can buy roses and other great memories with noseblowers and neighbors.
The revenue from the charity sales will be used to support the corresponding type of conservation project.
On the last week, more than 1000 euros were collected at charity sales.
How to calculate how much sugar is in the milk product?
According to the European Union food labelling standards, the package can indicate the amount of carbohydrates and sugars that are not equal to the quantity of white, so-called table sugar, Krista Kalbin, the marketing director of Valio Estonia.
According to him, there are actually three types of sugars in dairy products: lactose in milk, natural milk sugar, glucose in fruit and fructose, and added sugar or sucrose.
However, if you remember a few simple basics, according to Kalbin, the calculation of added sugar contained in the product should not make difficulties.
First, it must be made clear whether this is a milk or acidified milk product.
The normal milk and milk drinks contain about 5 grams of natural milk sugar, i.e. lactose 100 grams per product.
In acidified dairy products, yoghurt or kefiribs have consumed some lactose during the acidification process, making it acidified in dairy products on an average of 3.5g/100g of lactose per product.
“In order to calculate the amount of added sugar, it is necessary to calculate first the quantity of sugar from the lactose,\" Kalbin said.
It is now necessary to calculate the amount of sugar from berries and fruit fructose and glucose.
“In general, fructose and glucose flavoured milk products have a normal 3-4% fruit content of ca 0.3 grams, and in particular berries of about 15% fruit-containing products up to 1.5 grams per 100 grams,” Kalbin said.
According to him, this simple calculation shows that the share of added sugar in berry juices may be up to twice as much as the proportion of sugars indicated on the package.
In the case of lactose-free products, the situation is slightly different as sugar content depends on the production technology.
Compare the cheapest spa packages: night club tickets to sauna rituals
The delivery of the mailman’s consumer compared the cheaper packages offered by the spas to one person for one night on 11-12 August.
“Spahotels are at different levels and service range, so one comparison is very difficult only to make based on price,” said Mario Sau, sales manager of OÜ Spa Tours.
Compared to accommodation with spa facilities, the prices of the cheapest packages vary several times and the choices are available to both a more demanding customer and a more modest vacationer.
For example, if a single-seater traveler can spend 51 euros in a single-seat room in the Värska Spa with buffet and breakfast and unlimited use of water park, gym and saunas, then a single person will receive a package of EUR 288 when visiting the Pädaste Manor in Muhumaa.
It includes accommodation in Double Deluxe category, breakfast in the restaurant Alexander in the winter garden and a half-day spa package.
When choosing and comparing different packages, it should be taken into account that, in order to get the most favorable price, you should leave with a friend or companion, because in the double room you will find it cheaper than taking a single room.
However, if it is a wish to rest alone, the guest will have two-seat rooms as well as two-seater rooms.
In general, if a passenger without a companion is to be paid a fee of just a couple of euros for being alone in a two-seater room, it is also possible to find more favourable options by compromise.
For example, Fra Mare Thalasso Spas, located in Haapsalu, pays 86 euros per night in a single room, but, if desired, it is also offered a more affordable option to stay in a double room provided that, in the event of a lack of space, someone else will be accommodated in advance by informing the customer.
In this case, the price of the package will be 58 euros.
It is worth being flexible to get the best deal.
The prices of the packages are dynamic, so they depend on the day of the week and the fulfillment.
“For the most advantageous package, prices may vary from EUR 112 to EUR 248 – the sales and marketing manager of V SpaaHotel in Tartu explained their price policy.
He also drew attention to the fact that their hotels have a variable price, depending on their performance, and added that the customer will generally receive the cheapest price by booking directly from their website or asking for the offer itself.
Since the summer season is the fastest for the spas, it is worth planning the holiday in time to avoid the situation where the desired place has been sold out.
For example, only suites have been selected in Pärnu Hedon Spa and Strand Spa on 11 August and in the conference hotel, as well as the Vihula Manor in Lahemaa have been sold out.
There is no need to look far to spend a relaxing holiday: almost every major city in Estonia finds one or more spas.
It is worth investigating before buying a package, and at the same time there is no major event near, because it will immediately increase prices to the ceiling.
For example, until August 11-13, the events of the White Lady will take place in Haapsalu.
At this time, Haapsalu has a lot of tourists, the demand for accommodation is very high, and we apply the prices of major events at that time.
“We don’t have accommodation at the time of sale at discount or cheap packages,” said Laine, director of the spa hotel, Irene Field.
Chinese company coming to Estonia in Mullu immediately made 100 million euros of turnover
In the Chinese ownership of agricultural production, Agritera, which started operations only last year, reached almost EUR 100 million.
Nearly 2 million euros were earned, written by Business Day.
The company’s annual report shows that the sales revenue of Agritera OÜ engaged in the purchase and wholesale of agricultural production amounted to EUR 100,6 million in 2016.
The profit was EUR 1.91 million.
A year earlier, there was no economic activity in the company.
The company employed an average of 3 people in the past year, and in 2015 there were no employees.
The turnover per employee amounted to EUR 33.6 million, with an average gross remuneration of EUR 316 per month.
Jüri Kolk: rest throughout the year, so you don’t need a vacation.
Of course, I was guilty that this holiday was not rested.
I guess I was also a somewhat needed employee, but I guess the only one who thought I was irreplaceable.
It's my fault that stupid duty was on my chest.
The quote at the beginning of this column is great because it is fully true.
So it was - the new agency I started in March of the same year, although it required working part of it, but something was so much better for me to recover to a whole new life in three months, I rested myself.
It's summer, vacation time.
It's time to give a new year's promises, check out what's happened in life and what direction this whole thing is going to be.
“For this reason, Christmas and the change of the year – now some decent citizens are calling badly.
Perhaps, but we all know from our experience that Christmas is not suitable for thinking about life and setting goals.
All right, I'm just saying for myself - I can't make any changes in the year.
It's too hard for me.
Of course, in Christmas time there is happiness and joy in the barns: I like the knowledge of the beginning of the victory of light, like the Christmas lights, and also Jesus was with a warm attitude, a revolutionaryly thought on his back.
Nevertheless, during Christmas, I’m mostly very tired and sometimes stressed – already because of the darkness.
Yeah, I'm doing a lot of vacation-free life, and I'm doing a lot of work, maybe more than doing it in some fucking slaughterhouse, and I'm always quite rested.
In most cases, I’ve run like a squirrel biked before Christmas – gifts, at least four Christmas parties, a little bigger load at work...
If you also take into account the endless social pressure to feel in the heart of unconditional joy and peace, the difficulties of Christmas are obvious.
But a desperate and tired person can’t make good decisions, long before he can improve them.
These things need to be done with more or less clear head.
A tired person throws an empty and sound promise, which is about as much as the purchase of a lottery ticket when the foundation of the future is stored.
The promise to change something should be calmly thought through, the benefits should grow, it should be a plan.
The plan, as opposed to the promise, includes, apart from the goal, the action guide, and does not break after a few clicks.
That's why I'm saying the best time to make promises is now, in the summer.
You just need to calm down and figure out why it’s so tired (if it is).
If you do not commit yourself to being robbed of the table during your holiday, then it is enough for a couple of weeks to find some hooks in your life worth bending straight and figure out how it can be done.
I need to live as important as possible so that I don’t need a vacation so I can rest in a running way, not once a year.
So that the holiday would be an additional night, not a box stop for survival, during which it will be loaded so much to be able to withstand the next year somehow.
I recommend at least one simple summer promise for everyone - if you need to get up at a certain time next morning, then get some sleep in the evening.
I believe that if every ten postman readers heard my recommendation, life in Estonia would be significantly better.
I intend to follow my advice.
We already have a Thursday work week, but not the way we expect it.
Open office.Photo: Scanpix, PantherMedia / Wavebreakmedia ltd
Many Estonians already have an unknownly desired Thursday work week.
But not as they would expect, it is written by Business Day.
This has been created by a modern office planning, i.e. an open office.
A prestigious management magazine, Harvard Business Review, takes nearly 1.5 hours a day for employees, or almost whole working days a week.
However, if four working days and three rest days are considered within a four-day working week, such a forced solution is worse.
The 1.5 hours taken from work time have been decorated with concentration difficulties, confusion of work, increasing irritation and anxiety and loss of work instead of family and hobbies or recreational recreation.
The third week of the week is accompanied by a strong wind.
That’s how an evening photo of the camera was caught up in a big mess who was trying to fly the wind in the trots.
Due to the windy weather, many festival guests say that the mouth and eyes are full of sand.
How a man built a theme park that paid 51 million dollars to his daughter
A father living in Texas discovered that there were no theme parks where his disabled daughter could play.
So he decided to build one himself.
Gordon Hartman had just come out of the pool when his 12-year-old daughter Morgan approached other children playing in the water.
He tried to make friends with them, but they quickly left the pool.
Hartman thinks they're scared because they don't know how to treat a disabled person - Morgan has a five-year cognitive understanding and a certain form of autism.
This incident left him haunted.
“Morgan is a wonderful young girl.
Meeting him always brings a smile to his mouth, and he definitely wants to hug.
But there have been many times where we haven’t been able to take him to different places,” he says.
Hartman and his wife Maggie asked the other parents where they could take their daughter - somewhere where she would feel comfortable and others would feel well when talking to her.
“We knew there was no such inclusive place,” Hartman said.
In 2007 he decided to build it itself.
The former real estate developer sold his home construction companies in 2005 to build The Gordon Hartman Family Foundation - a non-profit association that helps disabled people.
He then started to create the world’s first most accessible theme park.
“We wanted to create a theme park where everyone can do everything that can play with both special needs and people with no special needs,” Hartman said.
He invited doctors, therapists, parents and other disabled people to consult about the facility.
They were set up in a 10-hour career in San Antonio, Texas.
The park, called Morgan's Wonderland, paid $34 million (€26 million) and opened in 2010.
Attractions include a fully accessible view wheel, an adventure playground and a mini train.
Visitors often tell Hartman that they were only able to experience such attractions for the first time.
There is also a carousel with specially designed shelves for wheelchairs that move up and down next to animals.
Hartman says that Morgan was afraid of driving at the beginning.
“When we opened it, he didn’t dare go to it.
He did not understand why it was going around and why the animals were moving up and down,\" Hartman said.
It took three years before Morgan agreed to go to the carousel.
“At first, he just stood close to it, then he sat on the animal, but we didn’t drive.
It was a slow process, but now he loves to drive it.
Getting over something that scared him meant a lot for him.
Small things in the game make a big difference.
Since its opening, Morgan's Wonderland has visited more than one million people from 67 countries and all 50 U.S. states.
A third of the staff is disabled and entry is free for anyone who has some condition.
“I thought Morgan was one of the lucky ones because he has a lot of things he needs.
I didn’t want the price to be an obstacle to other people with special needs,” Hartman says.
“We open every year, knowing that we’re going to lose at least a million dollars (750,000 pounds), and we need to make it back with the help of harvests and partners.”
This year, the theme park was extended by opening Morgan's Inspiration Island, a water park that is fully accessible.
“Julis visited the park for less people because the wheelchairs became too hot.
So we decided to set aside the water park,\" Hartman says.
In some parts of the island, warm water has been used to help visitors with muscle problems.
Waterproof motorized wheelchairs are available that work with compressed air, not batteries.
It is also possible to drive a boat on the river.
The water park cost 17 million dollars (13 million pounds).
“At yesterday, a man came to me from Inspiration Island and just kept my hand,” Hartman said.
“He pointed to his son, who has serious special needs, and began to cry.
He said his son had never been able to play in water before.
According to Hartman, there are no three parks with each of the four visitors with disability, and the park has exactly the effect it hoped for.
“It helps people realize that although we are different in certain ways, we are actually exactly the same,” he says.
“I saw a girl in a wheelchair go to another girl with no special needs, and they started playing together.
It was really cool.
Hartman is not planning to open more parks, although he has received hundreds of letters by post and mail from people who would also like to have a neighborhood park.
Instead, he focuses on providing educational facilities to young people with special needs in San Antonio.
“I know there are many different organizations that are trying to build something similar to Morgan’s Wonderland elsewhere, and we continue to cooperate with them,” he adds.
He continues to take Morgan to play the theme park - Morgan is now a kind of celebrity.
“When he comes here, he’s like a rock star!
Many people want to talk to him and take a picture with him, he has to do well,\" Hartman says.
Morgan, who is now 23 years old, is getting better with things.
“He’s talking more and most of his physical problems have resolved with numerous operations.
We're so proud that he's gone so far.
When Morgan is visiting the park, he likes to play the most on rocks and sand, without knowing how much he has helped others.
“Morgan knows that the park has become a name for him, but I don’t think he understands what it actually represents and how it has changed lives,” Hartman said.
“He doesn’t realize that the way he has done things in his life has made him a real source of inspiration.”
U18 head coach Vaido Rego: play-off game can decide one or two times
In the Estonian U18-class basketball collection, Poland 68:63, the quarter-final of the EM B division, the head coach Vaido Rego said it was a real play-off meeting.
The game was rabbis.
Both teams had done their homework, the points came hard.
The game comes with a fact that has better nerves.
Play-off can be a single-two shot game – discussed by Rego.
You win, but the coach is looking for what to improve first.
Nuriseda always gives.
Some of our mistakes were not justified, the opponent became light free shots and lived on them.
This has happened before - if you go aggressively to protect, there is a danger of overcoming.
Let’s draw our conclusions,” Rego said.
He used nine players today, leaving Robin Kivi behind due to some encounter injuries.
These decisions are born in an ongoing manner.
The stone made it with morning training and pre-game warming, but was still not 100 percent ready, the instructor explained.
Tomorrow at 6:15 a.m., the Estonian semifinal will meet with the UK, who was defeated today by Bulgaria 76:73.
The winner of this game will raise the EMI A Division for the next summer of the U18 age class.
Video: Vassiljev created another penalt for a new club
It was already in the ninth minute of the game at home against Wroclaw Slask, but it was 20 minutes later.
Vassiljevil was a great opportunity to secure the first victory of the season.
Four minutes before the normaler was filled with a semi-protected pen.
The match ended with a 1:1 knife.
Piast has gathered two points with four rounds and is located on the 15th or 15th in the league table.
How can you keep sex exciting if you try to have a baby?
Therefore, it is very important to keep the cholelecs loose even when you are trying to create a new life.
Female First gives advice on how to do so that sex does not seem to be an annoying obligation.
Don’t take it as an obligation
This can happen to every couple who tries to get pregnant.
Sometimes pregnancy can take years.
Hand after sex takes away spontaneity and romance.
Try to be spontaneous!
Women often feel unable to enjoy “normal” sex at the end of the cycle when it is known that a positive result will not come.
This creates tensions in relation, which in turn leads to a decrease in sex, and less sex means, of course, even greater chance of not becoming pregnant.
However, men feel they need to be able to “present” when they are required to do so.
If you know your fertile days ahead, it can be there for you to plan something romantic with a loved one.
Have a special dinner or just spend time together - enjoy each other!
Take into account a fertile period.
From the point of view of reproduction, there is no point in having sex when the ovulusion has taken place, but in order to make your partner happy, try to have sex for some days without fruiting.
Although there is no evidence that pregnancy will take place more firmly than a woman can get orgasm, don’t forget it!
Remember that every couple is different.
Everyone can do differently with the baby's stress.
Some men want to be aware of the woman’s cycle, but others prefer not to know that they don’t feel the pressure “to be exposed to demand.”
No one knows better than you.
Find your solution!
Studies have shown that the highest success rate is for couples who have sex every couple of days, but not every couple can keep such density.
The most important thing is to find a pattern that suits you as a couple of best.
IAAF warns that fraud is closely monitored at the London World Championships
On Friday, the world championships start in London, and the athletes have been involved with doping scandals in more ramb light than ever before.
These world championships are the first to be monitored by the new organ, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU), which also monitors corruption, gambling, and misappropriation of results.
“It is not possible to exclude that the nature of people does not allow such things to happen.
However, we can say that we have the best practices and the best anti-doping program that can be based on information and data collection at all now, and we will see the result after the event,\" said David Howman, a representative of AIU.
AIU has allowed 19 athletes to compete as neutral athletes from about 190 Russian athletes who have been caught with drugs.
Portable: Levadia destroyed the Paide City Team at home
Levadia has put itself in a difficult position, because in the previous round, the alien was surprisingly lost to the future of Viljandi, and the table leader Flora used the opportunity offered, sliding to seven points away.
From behind, the same stick with Levadia has reached Nõmme Kalju.
In the summer transition window, Paide, who is incarnated with the composition of the summer, continues to feel a lot of lack of the captain and midfield host Andre Frov.
In the last seven games, only two sign points have been recorded, and in the league table there are eightth place - Tartu Tammukkah in the ground with four points and the future in front of four points.
In the first game between them, the Pope lost 0:7 and 2:5.
\"My watch died, but I didn't,\" said the actor Raivo E. Tamme on the face of Ironman 70.3.
True, the whole half of the triathlon did not fall out of the smile of the Raivot.
Moreover, running 21.1 km, he got into a conversation: “I talked to one person during the run, one man ran by, and he was amazed: “Lord, you can still talk to me.”
On the run, Raivo, who shared the energy to talk about, went over the highway a few times.
Coach's recommendation.
“Ain-Alar Juhanson said that you can walk uphills that there is no point in pushing because there are such rises here and there is no particular difference in time between running or running the highway,” the actor said.
He was also able to take a breath at the time of walking, and after crossing the finish line, he was able to share unscrupulous interviews with the left and the right.
As if there were no 1.9 kilometres of swimming behind the back, 90 kilometers of cycling and 21.1 kilometers of running.
“I think that my training is also the kind of way I can enjoy this competition,” admits Raivo, who started training in January and lost 16 pounds of her weight by today.
And as for interviews, it was my wish that I could give after the final interview.
I have been able to give interviews after every race and I was hoping it would be nice to do it after Otepää Ironman.
I thought it would be all right if I wasn’t on the ground on the west side after Ironman – the opposite-flying lens-land-like being offered a vision of Raivo’s finish line, rather than the other image: hands were triumphant towards the sky and the face of a sincere victory.
There were also reasons: Raivol took 46 minutes and 24 seconds to swim, 90 kilometers to ride for 3 hours and 32 minutes and 21.1 kilometers to run for 2 hours and 18 minutes.
\"My heart is now given to the triathlon,\" Raivo, who already shouted at the finish, said he gave a finger to the sport, and took a ring to the fireplace.
I already registered on August 20, Gran Fondole - 230 kilometers from Tallinn to Tartu with a bike!
I'll work out again tomorrow!
Disney Longtime Counselor and Director Marty Sklar died at the age of 83
Sklar, who died on July 27 at his home in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, maintained ties with the company after he retired in 2009, which had been precisely scheduled for Disneyland opening the 54th anniversary.
Last year, on the opening day of Shanghai Disney in China, he became the only member of the troup (so the company invites its employees) who have participated in the opening of all 12 Disney parks around the world.
And less than two weeks before his death, he attended a meeting of Disney fans in D23, sharing memories of Disneyland.
His death was reported by Disney Company, not to mention this reason.
He was 83 years old.
Sklar's position as editor of The Disneyland News was temporary, but he returned to Disneyland after U.C.L.A.'s graduation in 1956 to work in its advertising department.
He soon became Walt Disney’s main shadow author in writing promotional materials, commitments, souvenir leaders, speeches, slogans, presentations, and short films, such as a piece of paper that helped the company get approval for the construction of Walt Disney World and Epcot in Central Florida.
He also collaborated with Walt and his brother Roy on Disney's annual reports.
“These were quite agile times for a person who only approached his 30th birthday and had only six or seven years since college graduation,” Sklar wrote in his autobiography “Dream It! Do It: My Half-Century Creating Disney’s Magic Kingdoms (2013).
However, despite the fact that Walt Disney trusted Sklar in writing, he appointed Sklar at the 1964 New York World Fair to Ford's pavilion, where Disney Company designed exhibitions and attractions.
Sklar wrote a story to Walt Disney for the Ford Pavilion for Magic Skyway, where he could see the animatronic dinosaurs and cavemans, which was their main connection with large corporate sponsors.
It was the beginning of the second act of Sklar in the company.
As an ever-growing member and director of Imagineers, he was increasingly linked to Walt Disney's legacy, who died in late 1966 a while before the opening of Walt Disney World in 1971 and the opening of Epcot in 1982.
After Walt Disney died at age 65 due to lung cancer, Sklar returned to the world of writing when he was told that the company’s executives had not prepared a public speech, although “it was no secret that Walt was dying, as he wrote in his autobiography.
Sklar felt that he had to write a statement to which Roy Disney signed, but he realized that the lack of planning was a sign that Walt Disney's death had been paralyzed by the company's leaders.
“In reality, they were all scared to death,” Sklar wrote.
Martin Adrian Sklar was born in New Brunswick in New Jersey in February.
His father Leon was a teacher and mother, a maid Lily Fuchs, worked in Johnson & Johnson, before the family moved to Long Beach to California, when Marty was 12.
After high school, he had a number of temporary jobs, for example, he worked both in Douglas Aircraft, as a ice cream fan, as well as as as as a delivery of postal services.
But in May 1955, when his third year at U.C.L.A. ended, Sklar received a message to call Disney's marketing and advertising manager E. Cardon Walker.
During that time, Sklar U.C.L.A. was the new editor of The Daily Bruin.
Walker asked him to come to the newspaper The Disneyland News for a job interview with the creator and editor.
Walker said the theme park would be opened soon.
And it needs him.
Walker hired him after 20 minutes of interviews.
Sklar also had to prove to Walt Disney that he knew what he was doing.
“I had been working there for two weeks and had to present Walt Disney the concept of the page,” he recalled on the Disney Avenue website.
“If Walt didn’t like it, he would have thrown me out of the door and hired a professional.
Fortunately, Walt liked it.
I was 21.
It was scary.
I never worked at a professional level.
In the form of Sklar, Walt Disney (and also some other person) lessons at one time, “Some ten commands – or a manifesto of the board of the theme park.”
The hands include, for example, the following. Feel your target group.
Try to “be aware of the shoes of visitors” to experience attraction like them.
Just one story for each attraction at a time.
Bob Rogers, a solo entertainment expert, called Sklar's \"Scholar Student Boy\", played the role that Miki-Hir played in Disney's film \"Fantasia\" (1940) because he had provided Disney philosophy to three generations of designers.
His wife, Leah Gerber, daughter Leslie Sklar, son Howard, and four grandchildren, will fall behind.
Sklar was Disney's dedicated leader.
He regularly carried three bells of Miki-Hire (which showed him the clock in Los Angeles, Paris and Tokyo) and the gold ring of Miki-Hire.
And he never forgot anything Walt Disney had taught him.
When Disney Company developed the California Adventure Park Children's Area, Sklar reminded planners that they would add activities that parents and children could do together, as Walt Disney had requested.
“I reminded everyone that Disneyland existed at all because Walt had the habit of taking his daughters to the carbell of Diane i and Sharon Griffith Park,” he told the magazine The Los Angeles Times in 2002, “and Daddy had to sit on the parking bench and eat peanuts and popcorn until the children went alone.”
Police took over 200 people during the Week.
In total, more than 20 crimes were registered in Pärnu City in the festival days.
There is a reason to associate with the music cup about half of them, along with the use of violence, the possession of a large number of narcotic substances and two drunk leadership were registered.
The misdemeanour proceedings initiated by the port were mainly related to the processing or possession of underaged or prohibited substances.
The letter received a theft and a breach of public order.
The police department brought over 200 people for various reasons.
About half of them were minors and mostly the reason for the delivery of alcohol at the police station.
I had more than half the minors in the department.
A half hundred people were also taken to Kainenma, as much as last year.
The words of Andres Sinimeri, Head of the Police Department of Pärnu, are expected in the light of the great crowds of the aforementioned numbers.
As in previous years, we had been thoroughly prepared this weekend.
We included additional forces from other prefectures, police departments, and assistance police to ensure the readiness to react quickly.
Most of the situations were resolved with a word and were enough to communicate with citizens.
“There were so many bad deeds, because the police were in the city to see and feel enough in our opinion,” Sinimeri said.
His opinion was extremely positive that minors who consumed alcohol were apparently less and young people proved to be able to celebrate.
He thanked the top team in the security company who took care of security at the festival.
I would like to thank all the festival guests who were politely up and celebrated safely.
“I also thank local residents who contributed to the successful event of the grand festival with their understanding,” the police chief said.
At the Pärnu Police Department, owners are looking forward to the objects found in the city and the festival area during the weekend.
According to Annika Pärna, who was responsible for returning the findings at the festival, Pärnu Service Manager, the items lost this year were less than last year.
In the festival police tent, more than half of the current findings were returned to the owners.
Most of the time, bank cards, identity documents, mobile phones and keys were lost in three days.
“There are 13 other mobile phones, three wallets, a laptop, a knife and several car keys waiting for the owner in the department.
101-year-old man jumped off the plane.
The Second World War Veteran Verdun Hayes recently received a military award to celebrate his world record-breaking parasol.
The man committed violence at the age of 101 and 38 days, making it the oldest person in the world.
The Group of Business is calling on the government to agree on the transitional terms of Brexit
One of the UK’s largest group of business athletes encourages the government to finish the dance around Brexit’s suburbs.
The Institute of Directors (IoD) appealed to the government to go out with a “transitional agreement” to make the progress with Brexit smooth.
It is hoped that the government will establish a “Brexit gap” between the exit of the bridge from the EU and the establishment of new trade agreements.
The group warned that without such an agreement, the business was ahead of the \"short-term chaotic on the shores of the rock\".
They criticized the government for being involved in “the transition in all sorts of speculative disputes.”
In recent weeks, government members have expressed controversial views on how long the transitional period will last and what it will bring with it.
IoD's report on \"Brexit salmon smoothing - opportunities for transitions\" states: \"As opposed to the long-term confusion of the problem, the government must bring a strategic debate around this issue.
This could minimize the growing confusion and uncertainty in this area.
Gerard Lyons, an economist and a group of Economists for Brexit, described this week’s concern “on the shoreline of the fluttering – over Brexit as “a talk of panic makers,” which resembles the fear of the Y2K computer program error in the turn of the millennium.
In June, Secretary-General Philip Hammond warned: “There are a large number of business investments that will be postponed until companies see more clearly what the likely outcome of these discussions is.
Allie Renison, Head of IoD EU and Trade Policy, said: “The Chancellor has the right to worry about the stretching of business investments.
This is one of the most frequently seen changes in relation to Brexit in addition to relocation of functions to the EU.
The latter applies in particular to members in Northern Ireland who are currently considering a cooperative or relocation.
IoD offers a number of options, including the following. Extension of Article 50 agreement from March 2019
Accession to the European Economic Area
Consent to remain in the EU legislation for a longer period of time
Establishment of a transitional customs agreement in the same way as the EU Customs Union
Renison said: “IoD offered these opportunities in connection with the transition, hoping that it would bake a proper debate on how best to finish Brexit.
Prioritisation of interim orders and, consequently, mitigation of risks of exit from the EU means that short-term chaotic changes on the shore of the cliff will not reduce future opportunities.
Russia's railway is exploring the possibility of embarking on St Petersburg-Kalingrad-Berlin's passenger train
Russia’s railway is exploring the possibility of embarking through Berlin-Peterburi train line Kaliningrad, said to Viktor Golomolzin Interfax Severo-Zapad, Director of Kaliningrad.
The monitoring of travel traffic tells us that, from an economic point of view, it is hardly possible to restart the Kaliningrad-Berlin trains.
And we're offering another route to Berlin-Kalingrad-Peterburi.
There are technical opportunities for this, both in terms of infrastructure and rolling stock,\" Golomozin said.
Golomolzin also noted that there are already Russian trains that can change the track scale and continue to move on to the European track.
Golomolzin considers that this direction is perspectiveal, because today St Petersburg and the inhabitants of the entire Russian northwestern region must travel through Moscow and Brest to Germany.
As a possible option, the route will be discussed through Latvia, the Latvian spokesperson Māris Ozols, who said there is no specific decision at the moment, confirmed to Latvia Delfi the Latvian railway (Latvijas Dzelzcețš).
Latvia's railways, along with its partners, including Russia's railways, seek to increase competitiveness in the service of passenger flows so that rail transport can compete with road transport.
Pakistani Hindus in India will not find refuge
Over 70 years after the biggest population migration in the history of the two countries that has begun to break apart, the prices continue to move from Pakistan to India.
Tens of thousands of people who do not even have the legal right to work in India are already in front of camp on the border of two countries.
Thus, many have no choice but to break illegally near temporary habitats by breaking the stone - the Indian authorities on the other hand are monitoring the movements of the frontiers from very steel.
Most of Pakistan's arrivals can't wait for such receptions.
No work, no house, no money, no food.
We worked in the fields, we were peasants.
Here, however, we are forced to break stones to serve our livelihoods, according to the 81-year-old Yogda.
For us, division is not over.
The prices are still trying to return to their country.
And when they come here, they have nothing,\" he added, an elderly man living in a field camp near the city of Jodhpur.
After India’s independence from the British colonial power in 1947, more than 15 million people lost their home.
The separation caused a violent wave of months of violence, in which at least one million people lost their lives because of a lack of faith.
In the midst of the bloody chaos, Hindus and snails were just formed from Pakistan, while Muslims moved in the opposite direction.
Despite migration, prices remain one of the most numerous minority groups in Pakistan.
In different estimates, they account for about 1.6 percent of the 200 million national population.
Many of them complain about constant discrimination and fear of kidnapping, rape, and forced marriages.
“The persecution began soon after the separation,” said Yogda, whose family moved only a few months before the two countries broke out to get out of the drought in the areas of the current Pakistani region.
It wasn't until the day we could live in peace.
I wanted to come back to live my prices in the middle of my brothers.
The National Government of the Indian Prime Minister Naredra Mod has said that he wants to make it easier for religious reasons to find asylum in India.
Last year, the government began to allow immigrants to apply for citizenship in their residence, and earlier the whole business was carried out through the central government.
After seven years of living in the country, the prices that have moved from Pakistan to India will open up a possibility for rapid citizenship.
However, due to bureaucratic delays, this process is often much more time-consuming.
The 64-year-old Khanramji left Pakistan in 1997 and became Indian citizenship in 2005.
However, many of them said they had abandoned and returned to Pakistan because they see that they are not waiting for a good life in India.
The government offers no support.
We are like livestock without the owner.
We're just trying to survive,\" Khanramji said.
But even worse than poverty is the scepticism of the authorities.
Those who do not have citizenship must suffer from harassment by intelligence agencies.
They are being treated as suspects and agents in Pakistan, he explained.
Singh Sodhal, who was committed to helping Hindus from Pakistan, was a major expectation of Mod in 2014, but has now been disappointed.
During the Mod government, tensions between India and Pakistan have increased, and the most migrants suffer from this.
“These things become hell,” Sodhal said.
For many, this treatment is better than life in Pakistan.
Horoji and his two adult sons fled to India two years ago, because he had begun to kill his Pakistani neighbors.
“We had to escape to India to save our lives,” said Horoji, 65, whose grandparents were from the present Indian territory, but found themselves on the wrong side of the country’s split.
My grandfather moved to the other side of the job.
But he told us that we would move to India at the right time, because the future could become dangerous to Hindus.
I think we've been pretty good.
“We have done well with our work and work,” says Andres Sinimeri, chief of the police, how the first two days of the Week have been going on for them.
Sinimeri says there are police officers and high-speed reacters on the streets today, and they also interact with people – perhaps they have questions and want to know how to become a high-speed responder.
Over two days, the police have been dealing with some of the fights and drug cases.
“There have also been a few large amounts of drug treatment, but we’re going to make a summary when the Weekend is over,” says Sinimeri.
About a hundred people have visited the police station in two days.
Fortunately, there were no cases of extremism needed to be resolved by the police.
By the way, Sinimeri says that when the sky comes to rain sharply and horizontally, they don’t have much work.
One of Haapsalu police chiefs has ever said that rain is like an extra patrol.
The Pärnu police have also made a staff in the Weekend area, where you can take the things found, and from there you can also ask for your lost things.
By the way, the police even lost one of their necessary gadgets, which good people carried out at the point of discovery.
Look at the video Andres Sinimer told the evening page.
Many of Emmy's nominations received from a screenwriter and producer Neal Baer paid $4.35 million for a home in Hollywood Hills West, whose roots extend to the atomic era.
In the modern style of the mid-century house, Josef Van der Kar was designed in 1945 and named it the original owners, according to the nuclear strategies Albert and Roberta Wohlstarter, the Wohlster House.
The 255-metre house on the edge of the access road with the gates has wide glass slides, which open in the garden, terrace and courtyard.
In the living room and dining room there are floor coverings, fireplaces and portable panels that open the kitchen.
The main part of the house consists of three bedrooms and three bathrooms.
There is also a separate guesthouse, with a view of the giant fishing pond and the sleeping blood.
The separate building also has a bathroom and an additional storage room.
Albert Wohlstetter was an influential nuclear strategy during the Cold War.
Roberta Wohlstarter's analysis of intelligence failures prior to Pearl Harbor attack was also quoted by the study committee on 11 September.
Wohlstarters have advised the Presidential Administrations of Republicans and Democrats, including John F. Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis.
They received the President's Freedom Med from Ronald Reagan in 1985.
Baer is the most well known for his work in television dramas, for the sake of “Cyrbab Hospital” and “The Law: the Investigation Unit for Sexual Crimes”
The real estate brokers were Mike Deasy and Sara Clephane from Deasy/Penner and Partners.
The buyer was represented by Hattie Ramirez from Keller Williams Realty.
The plane drew the perfect image of itself over the U.S.
The pilot took a plane to a pig country flight over the United States and was able to even have some fun on the route.
The real-time flight data of the aircraft indicated that this was not only a straight line or arc, but a sequence of air routes that formed the image of the aircraft connected together.
Flight BOE004 departed from the Boeing Field airport by local time at about 15.40 on Wednesday, according to Flightradar 24.
Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner took the east over Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota, before suddenly changing the course and flying to the southwest.
Looking at the map, the strange route of the plane is a two-engine passenger plane.
According to Boeing, the flight is part of the 18-hour “control” test of the aircraft.
Instead of flying with a random pattern, the test team took his imagination, driving on a route of 787-8 konur in 22 states, said the representative of the Boeing Company to the portal RT.com.
“Dreamliner’s nose refers to the Puget Sound region, where the home of Boeing Commercial Airplanes is located.
The wings range from North Michigan to South Texas.
The tail is about Huntsville i Alabama, he added.
Boeing's remote jet 787-8 Dreamliner was launched in 2009.
The plane can accommodate up to 242 passengers and can fly more than 13 600 kilometers.
As the pilot used the radar as a personal canvas, the flight on the web caused an immense interest among the aircraft trackers.
Some suspected that it was a test flight, others offered that it could be a strange coincidence.
Multifilms that affect the clothing style of Estonian children
If, like children in Europe and America, the children of royal families or celebrities are often shaped by children, the parents of Estonia choose their clothes on the basis of cinema.
British little Prince Georgi is becoming a mother, with the example of Duchess Caharine.
Like his mother, the prince can also fire a real mess with his clothes in people, which has even become his own concept - the effect of Prince George.
The last such adventure took place a few weeks ago at the royal family visit to Poland, where George carried a ten-dollar blue-red stripe stripe from the Spanish brand in Tizza, whose crazy parents bought a brand from the online store in 24 hours.
The chefs from Estonia probably didn’t have much of them because the nobles of the king’s children were supposed to leave our parents completely cold.
Anna Ansmitt, Head of Communications of the House of Goods, states that children of star couples and foreign fashion trends generally do not affect our parents’ purchasing for their fashion children.
In Estonia, children’s shopping is the largest leading indicator of movies, cartoons and YouTube channels.
This is how the most popular products of the past few years are keyboards, multika-Frozen games, dolls, clothes, dancing dogs or cats, peeling penguins and so on.
At the same time, he confirms that, if desired, his children can also be dressed in the same way as European princes or princesses.
The Central Party does not recommend Savisaare
The leaders of the Central Party regions across Estonia made a call to the public and political partners, calling for a vote by the Central Party, not by the electoral associations.
In particular, this message is intended for those who consider Edgar Savisaare between the electoral union and the Central Party.
How Princess Diana used her makeup as a weapon
When I think of Princess Diana's makeup, the first thing I see is the eyeliner.
Younger age girl blue.
Later, the black wave line in his Martin Bashiri-Panorama interview, the effect of which was devastating when he looked at the thick eyelashes, bringing the immortal phrase: \"We were in this marriage three, so it was a little too crowded.
Large and wet eyes, surrounded by his weakness, paleness in the face with a thick black line, left him the impression of the wounded animal.
That's exactly what he was trying to achieve.
Outside the public, Princess Diana never wears much makeup, at least not according to modern standards.
It wasn't just that he didn't need it - he was, of course, beautiful - but he saw an annoying obligation, something that was more connected to work than pleasure.
In front of the public, he could wear a thick layer of makeup.
Once he arrived in the office of Conde Nasti, Vogue publishers, wearing a thick, orange cape.
He apologized, saying that his skin should shine like a sun, because if he went out “usually,” he would be photographed by typhophotographers and then presented all the accusations that he would look “wronged,” “wild, and tired.”
For this reason, Diana visited the solarium three times a week using a machine at home.
Today, such a course would naturally be bad for healthy reasons, but for Diana it was a useful goal - it allowed her to show the world her sunny nature, even though her interior was filled with black clouds and thunders.
Probably one of the biggest mistakes of the royal family was to think that if they approved him as Charles's husband, they would have a small beautiful genus with only a sugar sauce in the brain.
The reality was quite the opposite.
He didn’t want to be the best in the school, but when it touched the creation of the imago, he was a fifth student.
For Diana, the importance of hair and makeup was that they could be used to convey mood or hours.
Otherwise, they did not give him the slightest interest.
His friend Rosa Monckton - Diana was the godfather of his youngest child - remembers that makeup was nothing they used to talk about.
“I just remember that,” he said, “how much relief he felt these times when we went to rest together, and he didn’t have to make up.”
Today, we tend to think of makeup as something that improves the woman’s appearance, but looking back on Diana’s life cycle, it is clear that she used it as a tool for powerful relationship management.
These moments, when he felt the most free, were the most of his own, are the moments when he was also the most natural, wearing very little makeup.
In 1993, along with his two young sons in Thorpe Park, Loggers Leaf's attraction shone, he was wet and laughed from the heart, under the eyes of a pendant, like any other mother who spends a day with children.
Four months after he and Charles were notified of leaving, he finally saw atrocically anxious and “normal”
Or in later years, by removing from the training hall, behind the hair, in shape of the legs in bicycle pants, reddening the face from the workout, healthyness and vitality of every one of his pores.
Toward the end of his life, when he began to pay for his independence and his confidence grew, we saw more and more of such Diana.
He joined Halo Trust and walked through Angola minefield in January 1997.
At that moment, at 35 years old, hair soft and natural, the face almost completely free of makeup, he probably looked more beautiful than ever before, recalling this bright and hopeful young girl who smiled at a 15-year-old engagement photo.
Diana was just coming to her best years.
In the early days, the young Diana Spencer had a dreamy pre-Raffael nature.
But it didn’t take long for “Princessification – a process that was driven mainly by the press and palace to make Diana a refined young girl who would be worthy of her new condition.
Partly, it included Clayton Howard, a veteran makeup artist, who was often used by Lord Snowdon on photo scenes, handmade.
Howard met the Cardinal Diana for the first time at Snowdon Kensington City Hall to capture the official engagement picture for Vogue.
At the end of the 1980s, Diana was still an empty canvas.
His finest beauty products were from The Body Shop, such as Elderflower's eye gel.
Howard used Max Factory's juncture cream Sheer Genius tone Honey Touch and Max Factory's cheek stick with the Frosted Coral.
To the eyes he carried Elizabeth Arden's tone Rice and Timberland, and to the eye with a white oxidant effect.
The appearance was improved by Elizabeth Arden's blue pendant and blue tincture.
And we know all about it because Howard created a facial pattern for him.
“Diana’s eyes are so amazing that I wanted to emphasize their fascinating blueness,” she later wrote.
However, the final result is not particularly appealing to such a young girl – she looks like an 18-year-old who is getting 50.
Her eyebrows are too intense and too much boring brown is included in the eyes.
The most captivating is here, however, the notorious eyeliner at the inner edge of the eyelid in this solid Disney princess's blue tone.
A fantasy for a fantasy bride.
It’s not surprising why Diana looks a little uncertain at us.
One source of Diana's anxiety was the fact that she never knew where the public person ends and begins with a private one.
It was the beginning of this process.
The man who was most likely to influence Diana’s appearance was Mary Greenwell, who still plays an important role in the modern world of makeup.
A makeup artist, who is currently an ambassador to Chanel, is still one of the icons of the makeup world.
“Dianal was incredibly beautiful skin and long limbs,” he recalls.
“He was just beautiful.
The men adored him.
He was sexy without trying to do it.
Mary met Diana for the first time in 1991 when Vogue’s main stylingist Anna Harvey asked her to make a makeup for Diana before the December number photo session with one of the most prestigious photographer Patrick Demarchelier.
The team also belonged to hairman Sam McKnight.
This happened when Diana and Charles’s marriage break were the greatest and the division began in the name of public support.
“They didn’t tell us who it was, although we knew it was someone’s very famous,” Greenwell said.
“When we arrived, Diana just stood there beautifully, warm and friendly and extremely excited to be on the front cover of Vogue.”
This cover picture - Diana in a simple black sweater, jaw based on hands, her blue eyes bright, nail elegant French manicure, hair cut short - was breaking.
It was driven by positivity, individuality and elegance.
Above all, it was modern, giving on to the early nineties of clandestine minimal aesthetics and creating a strong contrast between Diana and the royal family, who stood ahead of the “gathering” as the queen later called it.
“Diana was very tensionless about her makeup.
He just wanted to look fresh and different,\" Greenwell said.
During time, he taught Diana himself to makeup - cream, conjugation cream, a hideout to raise eyes, eyelash - and stressed a healthy skin care routine, encouraging her to take good care of herself and to follow the mantrat-in-in-law beauty.
Diana says everything moderately, Greenwell says.
He slept enough and reduced alcohol consumption, which is very important for the skin with a fresh look.
The Princess preferred Guerlain's root cream, Clarins lipsticks, and Clinique's Wild Rose cheek.
But the biggest favor Mary Diana did was to lure her from the blue eye.
“It just made him so much older,” he said.
Instead, he used a combination of soft browns and neutral tones with a brown pencil line on a plaster line that was melted together, so that all the edges were beautifully soft.
Often, he used just a toning cream and a little sun bath to emphasize Diana’s healthy shine.
“It was customary for me to call the diana and invite me to discuss the products I liked to do,” Greenwell told me.
“I think it was relaxing for him; the opportunity to take a few moments for himself.”
His favorite was the luxury brand Clarins.
Diana allegedly used sun and night cream for sensitive skins and cleaning milk and toners with their Alp’s herbs.
He also went to the cosmetic Janet Filterman Central London beauty salon on a regular basis in facial treatment.
Diana was famous for her beautiful skin, but sometimes she had rosacea, moderate back rash, which is often due to stress.
To alleviate this, he used natural soothing oils, including plaster oil.
“Dianal had a wonderful bone structure,” Greenwell said.
The only part of the appearance he was very confident about was his nose.
Anna Harvey recalls: “One time, when the newspapers wrote that she had been with the nose in a beauty surgery, she turned to me and said, ‘Just if I had let my nose operate, do you think I would have chosen such a thing?’
When Mary Greenwell and Sam McKnight’s advice began to close, Diana felt more confident about her new appearance.
One of his most memorable public performances - in the 1994 Serpentine Gallery in London, where he was wearing a famous “handy dress”, an eloquent, bare-haired figure from Christina Stambolian - showing that he began to develop his life in the late years of Signaturation.
With short hair and hair combed behind the ears, Diana is at the same time sexy and dynamic, her short hair in sharp contrast with a very shiny black silk dress.
Her makeup is perfect - attractive, but at the same time modest, black eyeliner emphasizes her eyes blueness.
Without fear of bright colors, especially red, he was wearing a fiery candle, quite likely Revlon Red, which then became a trademark in some sense.
A few months later, he flashed his elegant red manicure at the Royal Nursery College.
The princess was the ideal of health and self-confidence.
Finally, he also had full control.
In the form and in the form of his makeup flawless, he conveys exactly what he wants the viewers to think: here is a woman who seems to have finally a sense of self-esteem and purpose in life, and who is finally, having just 36, found her place.
It's really a pity that he couldn't prove it to himself.
Edela - Japan is preparing for the arrival of the Taifuun Noru
A large part of Southeast Japan, including the regions that had been devastated last month by rain elections, was preparing for even more rain on Friday than the Taifuun Noru, which was one of the strongest storms in the world this year, was moving ever closer to the main islands of the country.
According to the Meteorological Board, strong winds and heavy rainfalls in the south of the south of the island of Kyushu in the south of the south and in Tokyo are about 1350 km from the Amam Island on Friday, and within 48 hours it is possible that it will rain down up to 800 mm of rainfalls.
The representative of the Meteorological Board said that Noru, which celebrates a certain type of deer in Korean, then is likely to turn to the bottom and pour the rain over Kyushu, although the northern parts of the island, which were hit last month by rainfalls and floods that killed 36 people and left four disappeared, are likely to get the worst.
\"This is a very slow storm,\" he added, pointing out that there is a greater risk of flooding, as in one region rains much longer.
Noru, which was at one point in category 5 of the typhoon and is an unusually long-aged storm, first formed two weeks ago and swirled the orbit along the north of the Pacific, before going to the north of the Pacific, by targeting Japan and weakening its approach.
The representative added that, depending on the change in the course, Noru may move directly across Kyushu and then along the island of Honshu Japan, but it is still difficult to identify the long-term journey.
There are places on the ground where, if necessary, conventional vehicles will not be able to do the best possible thing.
There's a solution for ATV.
The ATVs that are in use in the military area gave an overview of the Protection Home!
There is nothing new in military structures when using vehicles with such light weight and good capacity.
The need for them emerged already during World War II, but they were given greater attention a decade later.
Simplicity and Strength
Already in 1956, Willys Overland, a vehicle designed to evacuate wounded in the final years of World War II, became known as the M-274.
It is a bit strange to call the mechanical variable a further improvement.
It is difficult to imagine a more practical vehicle.
Wheeled platform, seat and steering: all, all luxury.
It was as if the super-grain builders from the engineer's desktop had hit the drawings too fast and began producing.
But in the war, comfort is much more acclaimed.
In this category, there was no alternative to the Vietnamese jungles.
The lightweight, less than five hundred kilograms of weight machine was able to coin them in places where the Willyse Jeep, who collected its super-transmitter mythological fame, had to show the brake lights.
Mostly, nearly 500 kilos of vehicles were used to carry both the moon and the life force.
On the other hand, lighter, unbeatable anti-tank weapons were also installed on the other back.
However, the accident caused such a vehicle under fire, and it still happened, the driver was able to shift the steering system forward in the last trouble, and let it be so low that it was possible to drive the vehicle to the abdomen in the flats.
The scenes were produced up to 1970, they were completed in 11 240, and they were in use in the army until 1980, when they switched out the race against HMMWVde.
Over the next two decades, the ATVs had a marginal meaning in the military districts.
They came back to the picture after the storm's twin towers fell in New York City, and the U.S. soldiers found themselves in the desert landscapes of Iraq and Afghanistan.
It was there that knowledge and understanding were born that there was a need for something to fill the void between Humwee and the infantry.
Since ATVs generally do not offer a significant protection, they are not the best choice to perform their military tasks directly.
However, fast and lightweight machines are suitable for performing special tasks.
For example, in intelligence and rescue operations.
There are currently thousands of ATVs and UTVs in the American military.
Most of them, like XUV550dki purchased for the Defence League, are essentially similar to those in civilian turnover, but supplemented according to the needs of the army.
The trademarks that came back from Kamufláž have been represented by names such as Kawasaki Mule, Hondalt Rancher and Foreman, Yamahalt Rhino and Arctic Cat, and the ever-expanding choice of leading military-ATV manufacturer Polarise models.
In 2013, Polaris signed a five-year contract with the American Special Forces Centre (SOCOM) for the supply of two-seater MRZR2 and MRZR4 and a separate five-year contract on the basis of a single Polaris Sportsman based MV850, which has both infrared and black-out lamps and innovative bee-like tyres, which ensure the mobility capacity after a hit of 50-caliber weapons.
Before the arrival of MV850 on the market, Polaris was able to deliver vehicles to the military MV700 and MV800.
MV700 is an armyed version of Polaris 700cc Twin Sportsman, which is included in front and back, a two-piece fuel tank for larger distances, a reinforced frame and a core, and a few more military equipment, with which farmers or even in the forest will not have more to do.
In the same way as the Polaris ATVs successfully used by John Deere M-Gators in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is equipped with weapons support, luggage storage cabinet and some other elements that are useless in the beaches, but necessary in the battle zone.
The 750 kg weight-weighting vehicle can carry almost its weight distribution, or, more specifically, 570 kg of stuff.
The power of the engine is also sufficient to carry lighter tails and cannon parts.
The rear part of the box with a variable shape, the sides of which are removed, allows to drive from point A(B), which is greater than that small but thrown insects in dimensions.
Later, the M-Gator upgraded versions of A1, which are 20 more powerful than the original 20-Foot M-Gator, and the subsequent reinforced frame A2, which is even better for the transport and towing of difficulties, and A3, which combines the positive properties of A1 and A2.
In fact, the M-Gators were introduced to Bosnia in 1997 and 1998, where medical companies used them to evacuate the wounded.
At the same time, they also reduced the load of soldiers moving on their feet, instead of carrying stuff that would otherwise have had to be served on the market.
If most of the ATVs in power structures are modified from vehicles for civil use, there are also some exceptions.
The most prominent of these are the soldiers named Prowler, made in Phoenix International, which have been successfully used in all sorts of combat, intelligence and rescue missions around the world.
According to the manufacturer, for the first time ten years ago, they have been introduced and overrun in vehicles designed for special operations, which are characteristic of conventional ATVs, as well as those that have been modified for the army, in terms of both conductability, durability and safety.
As a construction and externally similar to the usual ATV, Prowler is completely different from its construction and capacity.
It is faster, more durable, more stable and is able to carry both after and carry bigger difficulties than other similar vehicles.
For example, if, in the case of ordinary ATV, the driver must constantly play and use both hands for maneuvering, speeding, and braking to maintain the balance of the vehicle with his body position, Prowler’s driving is more similar to driving the car.
However, it doesn’t matter whether Prowler, Gator, MV850 or any other ATV or UTV concept and scope of use are similar to all of them.
And it is clear that in circumstances where defence spending is being reduced to a large extent, and instead of a large-scale conventional carrier, a smaller-scale, target-oriented wolf is engaged, light-weight and fast-duty small vehicles are joined by the army to remain in service.
As a result of the department's profma, the delicate data of vulnerable children were published.
As a result of an alarming violation, a child’s personal data were sent to a child’s mother, who was wrongly cared for, including information on whether they were sexually active.
The mother was sent an email table containing all the names, dates of birth, locations and specific concerns and attentions of all children under the care of a large service provider operating in Victoria.
The e-mail revealed the residence of each child.
The list states that one 13-year-old boy is released against the bailout and shows that one 15-year-old girl who has problems with self-harming, abuse and running certain substances is “out with a boyfriend and “don’t return this evening” and that one 14-year-old boy needs help “to take care of himself” and is verbally aggressive and physically threatening.
The table appears to be a transfer document intended to be sent to the night shift supervisor.
The document contains notes of when a child is expected to come home or whether they can contact the staff for a visit.
There are a lot of concerns about some children.
A 15-year-old boy has been told: “If the staff contacts to obtain permission to search the room and/or to review the laptop/USB device due to suspicion of inappropriate sexual material, this permission must be granted:
The document also states that a 17-year-old girl who receives only three months after 18 and is released from the welfare facility is at risk of suicide attempt so high that, if she escapes, the staff must call the emergency service immediately.
A 16-year-old free boy had been reported to be out and “calls staff to contact him later to pick me up.”
Although only the name of the property in which the children are kept and not their addresses are mentioned, the details are still sufficient to allow them to be found.
The 2015 data sheet came out when the mother shared her experience with Fairfax Media in communicating with the Ministry of Health and Service and Child Protection four years ago after taking care of her daughter.
He agreed to share his concerns now that his daughter had become 18 and left the system.
A decision to hand over his daughter to child protection was made after a violent incident at home. This case is one of the more and more complaints about domestic violence that parents file against their children.
It had worrying consequences that the mother would never have foreseen. For example, she was able to obtain a daughter within six months of leaving home from seven criminal charges, she moved hundreds of miles away from home to home, and the nobles, where she seemed to be successful, but then moved back without informing the parents, in addition, accepted and facilitated the relationship between her daughter and the older man.
The relationship with the first of these boyfriends, 17-year-olds, with whom the nursing authorities allowed a woman to regularly stay at a local hotel at the age of 15 at that time, ended when a young man was charged with sexual intercourse with the child a few days after becoming 18 years old.
“Why he left the system in a worse situation than when he entered it,” the mother asks.
“And if it happens to all the children who care,
It strongly supports the creation of an institution that would allow the Ministry of Health and Service to monitor children within the first few weeks after taking care of them before they are moved to their homes.
This would allow them to better understand how children interact with others and what their risks and their needs are, especially educationally.
The state government is looking for new ways to reduce the need for children to be placed in home care, among other things, by seeking better support for their parents.
With a strong focus on aid packages, financed with $62 million over four years, the aim is to help transfer children from home care to better-ordered situations.
In addition, a $5.6 million two-year experiment, which was published in October, allows professional caregivers to provide at least 28 children to help them get out of custody or avoid getting into it.
According to a representative of the department, the information leak was not officially reported when it happened, although the mother claimed that two department staff were informed within a few months after the incident.
The department is now working with the service provider to analyse the case.
“Every alleged private data leak will be taken very seriously. We will work to ensure that it is not adversely affected by relevant young people.”
In July last year, the minister of families and children Jenny Mikakos ordered an independent review of the sample of private child protection experts during the five-year period.
The department agreed with the seven recommendations presented as a result and has subsequently updated the Child Protection Guide to ensure that staff clearly understand their roles and privacy activities, modified IT systems to prohibit the automatic pooling of certain personal data, and officially reviewed the functions related to the privacy of the department.
Australian Bank Commonwealth Bank is accused of large-scale money laundering offences
The Australian government presented to the country’s largest mortgage against the lender Commonwealth Bank Thursday an accusation of widespread violations of the anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules.
AUSTRAC, the Financial Intelligence Agency, has announced that they have initiated a civil punishment procedure against CommBank in the Federal Court of Justice due to serious and systematic non-compliance, in the biggest case in Australia and in the first case in which a large bank is accused.
“CommBank’s behavior in this matter has left Australian society unprotected for serious and lasting financial crimes,” AUSTRAC said.
Commonwealth Bank said in his statement that they would investigate the charges more closely and respond to “when the time is right.”
Australia’s largest mortgage against the lender did not “at all times or at all – know about the suspicious circumstances, the total transactions involving more than $77 million ($61 million) in Australia,” AUSTRAC said.
According to the Agency, the Bank has committed a breach of 53,700 anti-money laundering and terrorist financing acts, in particular as regards the so-called \"intelligent deposit machines\".
The biggest case of this type was related earlier this year to the Australian most popular betting broker Tabcorp Holdings, who had only 108 alleged violations.
Tabcorp paid 45 million Australian dollars and is the largest civilian punishment in Australian corporate history.
AUSTRAC’s representative refused to comment on the possible penalty for CommBank or on whether there could be other banks on the Agency’s fireline.
The maximum penalty for overshooting money laundering and terrorist financing is 18 million Australian dollars.
Intelligent deposit machines are specific types of ATMs that accept cash and cash deposits and facilitate cash anonymous deposits.
According to AUSTRAC, the use of CommBank's intelligent deposit machines after their launch in May 2012 has increased significantly.
Cash contributions amounted to $5.8 billion in the month preceding June 2016 compared to $89 million in Australian dollars in the first six months after CommBank automated.
AUSTRAC claims in court documents that cash contributions were made under fake names, so that the income was received for syndicates importing drugs.
\"Even after CommBank's attention was drawn to suspected money laundering or scrapping, Commbank's accounts did not begin to monitor its customers to complicate and manage money laundering and terrorist financing,\" he said.
AUSTRAC added that CommBank’s accounts were also used to “distribute” – this is a form of money laundering, which includes transfers between countries, without the fact that money should exceed international limits.
Nordea and DNB will become a reality at the end of the year
The accession of DNB and Nordea Baltic units to Luminor will only take place in the last quarter of this year, writes Business Day.
Opening the doors in a common legal body has been slowing down.
Following the publication of the accession plans this summer, banks indicated that the completion of the transaction could remain in the second quarter.
In April, DNB’s communication manager said it would be postponed to the third quarter.
In particular, the Swedish Financial Supervision Authority gave Luminor additional guidance in order to comply with the regional importance of the combined bank.
Trump called New Hampshire it “Narchourka” by angering the politicians of the state.
“The President is wrong,” said the Republican Governor Chris Sununu of New Hampshire.
He is disappointed that his description of the epidemic ignores everything the state has to offer.
Senator Maggie Hassan, the New Hampshire Democrats, called the comments “resistant,” and Twitter said that his state does not differ in any way from any other that fights the widespread use of opioids.
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, as well as the Democrats, agreed.
“It is completely unacceptable that the president is talking about NH in this way,” he wrote on Twitter.
This is a completely wrong picture of the NH and the epidemic.
Opioid dependence - a category of drugs that include heroin and fentanyl - is the most deadly drug epidemic in American history.
In 2016, the overdose of drugs killed more people than weapons or car accidents - based on data analysed by The New York Times, it is estimated that 59,000 people - and is now the main cause of death for Americans under 50 years of age.
In 2015, more than 97 million people in the United States consumed painkillers with a prescription, according to the U.S. Department of Drug Abuse and Mental Health.
It is estimated that 12 million of these people did so in a way that had not been prescribed by a doctor.
The new Hampshire has been hit hard and its inhabitants have repeatedly raised the problem to presidential candidates during the 2016 campaign.
In 2016, New Hampshire was estimated to have died from 470 overdoses compared to 439 cases in 2015.
In 2012, they were reported by the Ministry of Health and Service of New Hampshire in 163.
On Thursday, Sunun described the opioid epidemic as “one of the worst health crises the state has ever faced.”
He said that the government has doubled the resources devoted to prevention, treatment and recovery.
According to him, the state has also spent millions of dollars on prevention programs aimed at children, law enforcement to stop drug trafficking and initiatives aimed at making the naloxone more accessible for treatment of overdose.

Why do dogs chew the grass?
Sometimes the dog thinks he eats medication when he doesn’t feel well and wants to vomit.
In fact, most dogs who eat medication are completely healthy.
Only less than 10 percent of dogs who chew the grass do so due to some disease.
One of the reasons a dog can suddenly start eating grass can be a diet regimen.
Dogs who have worms can also become more interested in chewing grass.
Thus, if a dog who has never chewed a lawn has suddenly been born after the grass, and it often eats it, it is worth checking to the doctor in order to quickly track the problem of possible digestive organs.
It is worth mentioning that the dog can eat the grass also because he likes this taste or he is just bored.
If the health problem is ruled out, it is worth determining that the family’s favorite can still have enough developmental and moodful activities.
From the West, there will be thunderstorms in Estonia.
Many people in North Estonia have heard about the noise and see individual shines.
This afternoon, the air service also gave a brief warning.
Today, most of the world is in North Estonia on several sides of the pond.
The skyscrapers are moving fast from the west to the east.
“The outbreaks of the southwest wind range from within the country to 15 islands and on the coast of 18 m/s, but the thunder may be accompanied by stronger winds,” the weather service website says.
However, the larger thunderstorm in the south-east of South-East Finland and Russia from St Petersburg.
Fortunately, the winds in Estonia speak from the west and the south, which is why at least there is no risk that larger storms would turn to Estonia.
Sylvester Stallone takes up the guest role in the series “Our Life” in the second season
The leading producer, Dan Fogelman, announced Thursday at the Television Critics Association Press Forum, that Sylvester Stallone will take place in the second season of the NBC popular drama series.
As a guest, the actor takes up the role of Kevin (Justin Hartley) in filming at the beginning of the season.
“Kevin plays in a big movie and we needed a big role,” Fogelman said.
At the end of the last season, Kevin was awarded an important role in a film directed by Ron Howard.
During this season, we will see how the character is involved in the project and also warms up relationships with his mistake, who is played by Alexandra Breckenridge.
According to my teeth, Stallone's film Kevin plays is his father-in-law.
“Our life, the star Milo Ventimiglia, who plays a series of past pictures by Hartley’s father, played as a coincidence in the 2006 film ‘Rocky Balboa’, the son of Stallone.
Fogelman said Ventimiglia’s still flourishing friendship with Stallone was probably the one that helped attract a large star to the show.
“We have a great scenario for him.
I think this is really exciting,\" Fogelman said.
\"Our life\" returns to television screens on September 26.
Two elite colleges were arrested in the United States.
42-year-old Northwestern Professor Wyndham Lathem gave himself to the police in California after police were looking for him.
At the 56-year-old University of Oxford, Andrew Warreni received police officers at San Francisco.
Men are suspected of being hit by 26-year-old Trenbolone Cornell-Duranleaau.
He was found dead in Lathem apartment in Chicago at the end of the month.
Some days later, the suspects made a large donation to one library in cash under the name of the deceased.
Before serving the police, Latham sent a video of the biggest mistake in life to friends and family members, according to a Chicago police officer.
CNN didn't see the video and the police didn't publish it.
Police say it was a cruel murder, and his body was transformed due to wounds.
Warren had recently arrived in Chicago from Britain, but the researchers have not yet identified whether or not he was familiar with the victim.
Both suspects fled the state before the arrest.
Elise Christie talks about how she got over Sochi's horrors and cyber bullying to swim again in the name of gold.
Compared to this fragile young woman, who recently weighed on her eternal goodbye to a wormade, her 26-year-old Christie has become unknown.
The wicked insults hit his feet off, especially because he was also tortured as a child at West Lothian school.
He is currently packing for self-confidence and believes that the challenge can reach the starting point of the circle, bringing at least one gold in Pyeongchang with him.
“Unfortunately, I want to go out as an Olympic winner,” he says, explaining the fearless goal.
“I feel I’m both physically and spiritually at the right point to handle it.”
He once dreamed of a lumber career until aesthetic elements began to reduce this interest.
“I was a very good jumper, but I had trouble with the artistic side of the thing,” he said while laughing.
“I wasn’t very good at elegance, in order.
It was a reasonable choice, because shortening is best suited to my personality.
The woman walks around the world: my daily budget is $5!
To be honest, I have had this experience, true 40 days in which I decided to “live” in South France to just be free and live a day at a time.
It was located in a tent, in the forest, in small town stations, etc.
In the second week, I joined a French “home,” a 44-year-old man.
Oh, don't think that some pedes or so: We just slept in the same park in Mentones and became friends, although he was 15 years old, he was a good socialist.
Turns out the man is a good family, Paris, former French Navy officer.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I joined him and spent the next 3 weeks together, from the city to the city, and about €5 per day.
Money came, so much to live.
The man taught me how to help provide help at night in the terraces and on the roads of closed hotels and restaurants.
We worked just so much that we would have food money for the next 2-3 days, and then...
At some point I was in a fever, and I decided that I could no longer...
I took a flight to Helsinki, home.
And, by the way, I still regret.
These 40 days were probably the best in my life.
In Indonesia, a man who stole three loudspeakers was burned alive, the Hungarian News Agency MTI.
A 30-year-old thief sneaked out of the Bekas Mosque near the capital city of Jakarta on August 1, but the sanctuary guard noticed him and shouted: “Take the thief away.”
Tuldigi's help, and they were about to go after the thief.
He escaped on a motorcycle and even swims across the river.
The retreat lasted a few miles, then one of the chasers hit the back of the stone, causing serious injury.
The raged chaser was caught by the thief and beat him through.
One of the runners poured over a thief with gasoline and set him on fire.
The innocent died at the site of the burn wounds.
The body was sent to the police hospital in East Jakarta.
The police took both dead motorcycles and stolen sound powers into their possession.
In the local press, the announcements initially appeared, as if it were not a thief, but an electric montograph who wanted to repair the sound powers.
However, the police determinedly removed these claims.
The victims of the deadly fire reported that they did not make a statement about what happened.
According to the German news agency dpa, this step is due to the fact that Indonees are not particularly trusted by police or judicial bodies.
Indonesia is the largest Islamic country in the world.
Of the 255 million inhabitants, Muslims are 87.2%.

British roots have also affected a lot of the table there - such as Vegemite, dark brown salty butter, which is determined together with butter on the island or cream, reminds the British Marmite.

Honey Joys, perhaps, is called honey cornballs.
Australia’s Cooking Celebrity Stephanie Alexander and his lifelong work, the kitchen Bible of chefs, “At least half a million Australian homes.” / Blake Storey, Prime Creative Media
In the fall this year, Stephanie celebrates her 77th birthday.
His father was a state official and his mother Mary loved food very much.
Stephanie studied the library at the university, and as Australian youth, if possible, went to the university to discover Europe after her studies.
In France, Stephanie’s food love was just a fetish and developed.
In London, however, he met his first husband, Jamaica's roots, Monty, with whom they returned to Australia in 1964, opened a simple restaurant at The Jamaican House in Melbourne.
Ten years later, marriage broke down and the restaurant closed the doors.
In 1976, he opened a little more prosperous restaurant in Stephanie Restaurant, which was one of Melbourne’s most popular restaurants for the next 21 years.
The restaurant is still being talked about as the first fine dining venue in Melbourne, which really was able to appreciate fresh raw materials and offered seasonal food - a fact that seems to be abitsat at the moment, but at the end of the last century it was not yet.
After the withdrawal of the restaurant business in 1997, Stephanie has focused on writing the cookbooks, they have appeared from her feathers 15.
There are even more productive food writers in Estonia, but in his case, no book has been simply a recipe collection.
For Australian chefs, the various Stephanie Alexander cookbooks have been irreplaceable.
For his life, however, the lady has a fifth cookbook, the top-flying “The Cook’s Companion,” a co-worker, now at least half a million Australian homes.
The book was first published in 1996, the revised release in 2004 and the latest version in 2014.
In my bookstore, it takes quite a lot of space in the 2004 edition, because in an impossible book there are about a thousand recipes on 1126 pages!
The latest option is even bigger.
Stephanie Alexander's life story: \"The Cook's Companion\" is at least half a million Australian homes.
This is a real cooking pie where, in addition to the recipes, different raw materials are purchased and stored, food-making technologies are introduced and recommendations are made for the purchase of kitchen goods.
Foods are in stark order, as well as there are many cross-references in the work - obviously the education of the library did not run down the side of the food writer.
Stephanie itself stresses that this book changed her life and gave a new direction to future work.
From the popularity of the book, it has something to give to people, led to the next large, kitchen garden project, which in our circumstances is comparable to school gardens.
The fourth Estonian person received a heart in Finland.
In addition to Finnish medicians, the postoperative period has been expected for doctors, cardiologist Günter Taali and cardiologist Pentti Põdra, who participated in the section of the North Estonian Regional Hospital (PERH).
“It’s hard to say how long the patient could have lived without a new heart,” Põder said.
Doctors have now lived with a heart pump for a maximum of eight years.
The man himself is still back and is not ready to talk about it.
He was diagnosed with heart failure for the first time two years ago, and the disease had already reached the final stage, causing heart failure.
“For this sick person, transplanting was the only option,” Taal added.
According to a cardio surgeon, the patient will no longer have any batteries or wires with the heart pump after transplant.
He is left only with scars and immunity suppressing grasses.
The patient can make a sport and live on as a normal person, he said.
The first year is the most dangerous.
He added that it takes three to six months to complete recovery.
According to both doctors, patients should be closely monitored for medications; however, medications also have side effects.
In addition, the patient should be controlled to avoid a donor organ rejection.
The most dangerous is the first year, but according to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, more than 50 percent of patients have been living for more than a decade.
Taal said that the results in Helsinki are better and the longest time has been lived with a heart transplant for 25 years.
The cardio surgeon explained that because of the disease, the patient had a bad circulation, he was given a heart pump that helped to recover for surgery a year ago.
When the pressure of the man’s heart artery fell, he became a suitable candidate for transplanting.
The transplant operation is not considered to be a very complex surgery: the correct timing is very important.
“It took a lot more time to get the pump and then reach the heart when a new heart was placed in it,” he said.
In addition, the cardiovascular surgeon developed surgery as a complex part of the bodybuilding from the outside of the bloodstream.
Rather, he said that heart transplants can be considered rare, because it is what Estonians need the least.
Note that kidney, liver and lung transplants are being performed.
The rare cut is still accompanied by excitement, but we have been practicing this work for many years.
Learning about yourself and your nervous system is one art at this office, he added.
The organization needs four more people.
According to the Tali, the patient’s heart was received, as the body was not suitable for patients living in any other country belonging to the Scandiatranspland Community.
Scandiatransplant is an organization of the organization, which is members of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Estonia.
There are currently four people on the heart transplant list.
“They are still read by patients,” Põder stressed.
For the longest time, the heart of the 0-positive blood group is waiting for large men.
“In Finland, the order is about half a year, he said.
There are also conditions for heart rate.
“A woman’s heart is not suitable for a man, the heart of a large person is small and so on,” the cardio surgeon reads.
How to finance business vehicles?
In the changed consumption society, the financial opportunities for vehicles have expanded – in addition to the usual turnover, companies are increasingly using full-service services or a more binding long-term car rental.
The leasing and rental of a vehicle is two clearly different financial transactions, which include different obligations and expectations, but which often cause confusion.
According to Villi Tõldi, the sales and marketing manager of the international car rental company AVIS Estonia, companies are increasingly moving towards full service and more and more and more use long-term rental opportunities.
The translation pointed out the main questions to which it is possible to choose a suitable way of using the vehicle when looking for answers.
How long to use the vehicle?
The maximum difference between car hire and leasing is the time of use.
“It is worth choosing a longer-term vehicle if the company has a plan to deploy business vehicles for a longer period of time,” explained Translation, adding that it is worth deciding if it is intended to own a vehicle, be full-service or long-term rental if the vehicle is intended to be used as a service, or as a service, but leaving maintenance obligations to the service provider and leaving the property.
“The car has a significantly shorter period of use than the rental period, but many major car hire companies also offer a long-term car rental, where car rental is carried out without complex contracts and free warranty – the Tõld introduced different car rental options.
Who will be the owner of the vehicle?
At the end of the normal service, the rental will be the owner of the car.
“In the case of a rental service, it is possible, at the end of the leasing period, to continue under the same or better conditions with a lease payment, instead receiving an equivalent new vehicle that meets the needs of the company,” he said, stressing that since the consumption society is moving more and more to a service-centric consumption, the possession of the vehicle is an additional obligation for the company.
In addition, in the case of a full service line, there is the possibility to buy a car on the basis of a wish and agreed terms.
However, there is no way to rent and pay only for the period of use.
Car hire is usually carried out in car rental offices and car hire from the rental office of the rental companies.
Car rentals are primarily engaged in the sale of vehicles, but also offer leasing opportunities and, in some cases, car rental.
However, rental companies have the sole purpose of renting cars.
The translation said that the reasons for using the rental service are different - many companies rent professional vehicles, in addition, it is convenient to use the service while travelling or when the car is repaired.
“In the case of commercial vehicles, more and more are transferred to a full service interface that provides the customer with cost transparency, time savings in the purchase, use and return process of vehicles and greater comfort, the sales and marketing manager introduced a growing lease trend.
Every year, more and more companies use full-service services in the case of their car park, optimizing their costs and focusing on their main expense.
What is the service-based insurance coverage?
If, in the case of a leased car, cash insurance and traffic insurance are mandatory, the rental car is usually covered with basic insurance, and it is also necessary to decide whether to include, for example, emergency insurance, theft insurance or full insurance. “If, however, compared to a full service line, the customer will be able to pay more than the equivalent monthly fee, since, in addition to the vehicle and insurance, the monthly payment also covers the regular maintenance of the cars, 24-hour support, tyre replacements and other agreed services, the Tõld explained.
“If you can take any new vehicle into the ordinary service interface, the service provider will help you choose a vehicle that meets the wishes and needs of the company, which also takes into account the functions of the use, he compared, stressing that full service leasing will certainly help to optimize the cost of car parks.
“The choice of railway vehicles depends on the car park of the service provider – different rental companies offer both a small and economical vehicle in their own vehicle park for use in urban traffic and a luxury so far for business meetings,” Tõld explained.
During a tight rental period, of course, the desired car may already be rented out, but it will help to book the desired vehicle early.
Choosing between leasing or hire, first of all, it should be clear that its objectives - how long it will be possible to use the vehicle and which are long-term plans for the car.
It is also important to carefully examine the different conditions and obligations of the services.

A command was given to the U.S. Navy veteran to remove the American flag from the mailbox
The difference between the U.S. veteran and Florida's homeowners' union is an American flag-covered mailbox.
Erus U.S. Navy officer John Ackert says he received a letter from the Tallahassee Southwood Union last week asking the mailbox to remove or stand up for the punishment.
He told the WCTV that he was not going to give up without a fight and has filed an appeal.
“I am honest with you as a bully,” Acker said.
And I think people should fight bullying in any form, especially that.
Ackert said that according to the Homeowners’ Union, his mailbox was not in line with Southwood’s aesthetic values.
U.S. Navy veteran John Ackert said he was told to remove the American flag from his mailbox.
“As a result of the approach to the end of the holiday season, we ask you to remove the American flag from the mailbox in the symbol of the American flag,” the letter sent.
The decorations may be out 30 days before and must be removed within 15 days at the latest.
He said it's been outside for four years.
It got there 30 days after moving to the house.
The messages to the Southwood residential community did not receive an immediate response on Thursday morning.
Some of Ackert’s neighbors told WCTV that the letter was a little harsh, and they were not particularly surprised by the activities of the homeowners of the Union.
“They do these things all the time,” said Mike Stephenson.
I think it's ridiculous.
Why can't you be patriotic in your country?
Mike Patel said, “It’s with a veteran who served our country.
It's just a flag box.
I don't think that's right.
The house belongs to him, at least it could be allowed.
According to a letter from the Union of Homeowners, Acker has 15 days to remove the envelope, otherwise he is expected to be fine.
He has not received an answer to his appeal.
I regret Vietnam – Germany's kidnapping
Vietnam said Thursday that he felt regret about the comments made by the German Foreign Ministry that accused Vietnam's intelligence service of the former Vietnamese oil company, who was wanted to be detained in the country due to the indictment.
The German authorities believe that the Trinh Xuan Thanh was captured from Berlin, leaving Vietnam to the intelligence bases on Wednesday for 48 hours to leave the country.
Thanh is faced with charges of possession which are accompanied by a death penalty in the event of conviction.
He sought asyl from Germany, but his statement had not yet been completed when the Vietnam authorities demanded his release.
The representative of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Le Thi Thu Hang, told reporters that these comments were “excellently unfortunate” and Thanh gave himself to the police in Vietnam on July 31.
“Vietnam always considers it important and wants to develop strategic relations with Germany,” he said without falling into details.
Thanh, 51, disappeared in July of last year after he was originally charged with unfair management in a subsidiary of the state oil and gas giant PetroVietnam, which resulted in losses of approximately $150 million.
The Vietnamese police issued an arrest order in September.
In March, the police launched an investigation to investigate the acquisition of the property in connection with its alleged participation in the real estate development project.
Thanh was Chairman of PetroVietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation until 2013, when he was appointed to several senior offices in the government, including the Deputy Chairman of the Haut Giangi Province in the south of Mekong Delta.
He was elected to the National Assembly in May 2016, but was released from the overwhelming legislative body of the Communists before the month following its first sitting.
He was also expelled from the Communist Party.
The Ambassador of Vietnam in Germany was invited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday and was informed that Germany would require the return of Thanh so that the procedure for issuing and issuing asyl could be properly implemented.
The driver saved eight puppies off the road, not knowing that the dogs actually have a owner.
“When I put these eight puppies, I would have been thrown out of the apartment with my dogs,” Oleg, the bus driver, joked, who kept an eye on the road, and gave them asylum to the employee.
Soon, however, the owner of the dogs of refuge appeared, for whom it remained unclear why the puppies were taken away from his home.
Harjumaa bus driver Oleg said he has worked as a bus driver since the beginning of the 1990s, but this case has not been preceded in the course of his career, “I took bus number 146 on his normal route.
Near the Harju-Rist, I noticed that there was something small running along the road.
I thought it was a bump, but it turned out to be four puppies,\" the bus driver recalled.
At the time, the heart went dark, and he stopped the passengers full of bus to pick up the puppies.
“It started, the cars would have crossed them, and the dogs would have been suffocated,” Oleg said.
He added that passengers were reasonable and offered soft dog-based pleasure.
The kids were a little scared at first, but then they became fun.
The dogs on board, went to the bus driver for a new round, because the timetable needed to be followed.
He saw four more small dogs in the same place when he was driving through the scene of the puppies.
It was a German sheep's dog.
They were so immediate and immediately saw that they were being taken care of.
The dogs were beautiful, they were amazing.
The first thought was, of course, that someone wanted to get rid of them for some reason,\" the bus driver said, “that’s why he decided to take the puppies to the bus.
“I also took these four puppies and called the police,” Oleg recalled.
The organizers contacted the Tallinn animal shelter, whose employee came to the puppies by the Baltic Station.
But did the bus driver have no temptation to take the hairballs?
That's the idea.
A dog boy was so beautiful and calm.
He sat like an adult dog,\" Oleg said.
Where do I put these eight puppies?
I would have been thrown out of the apartment by a woman with dogs.
We still have a little baby.
Soon to take a dog, he added.
The head of the Tallinn animal shelter, Eve Tobias, confirmed that the shelter was actually brought into the puppies of 8 German sheep dogs, who are two and a half months old.
But on the same day, the owner came to pick up the puppy.
“We didn’t even put these puppies in, and we gave them back just the same thing,” he said.
“The dog’s owner wasn’t very angry, but he said they had the only house in sight and the bus driver could have asked if the puppies belonged to them,” Tobias said.
However, the driver of the shelter added that it is a good thing, at the same time, that the bunches that hit the bus driver on the road were picking up, and therefore there was no accident.
In fact, it was very good for the bus driver to react!
Jordan's court enforces a life sentence for killing three U.S. militarymen.
Last year, the Jordan Military Appeal Court imposed a life sentence on Jordan's soldier for the release of three U.S. military trainers.
Last month, Senior Sergeant Marik al-Tuwayhale appointed an American prison sentence for killing Americans at the entrance to the South Jordan Air Base with hard work.
Al-Tuwayha opened a fire on the American armour, claiming he was afraid of a base attack.
After a decision on a security camera video, however, he also showed that he continued shooting when two Americans were shadowed and stretched with his hands to stop shooting.
On Thursday, Hala Akhbar, in connection with the Jordanese army, announced that the military appeal court with five judges confirmed the punishment of al-Tuwayha.
James Harrison spends about $300,000 a year to keep his body in play shape
Each player in the NFL depends on his body to make a living.
Therefore, many other athletes also invest a lot of money in body maintenance and restoration to stay in top shape.
Jeremy Bowler from the ESPN.com portal looked at how far some veterans are ready to go to extend their careers.
However, no case is so extreme as James Harrison, 39 years old, the player of the back line of the 14th anniversary of Pittsburgh Stelers.
According to Bowler, Harrison spends $300 a year on needle therapy, massage therapy, chiropractics, and coupons.
Most of the costs are related to travelling across the country to meet professionals.
“I don’t have to count on things like this,” Harrison said.
“If you compare the amounts you earn to my expenses, the payments are worth it, considering how I feel.”
Mike Mitchell, Harrison's training partner and teammate in Steelers, estimated the annual amount of $200,000 to care for his body.
30-year-old Mitchell has tested the body for relaxation (in English, ‘body temping’, described by Bowler as ‘55 kilos of metal as a massage roll’.
“ instead of rolling on it, they roll it on you,” Mitchell said.
“If you’re in some tense place and they’re going to move around, it’s sometimes painful.
But when you get up, the tension is gone.
It just beats the tension out.
They are ready to make additional efforts, but former NFL players Barry Cofield and Ryan Harris spend an average of $50,000 a year on recovery.
Cofield, who played 10 seasons in New York Giants and Washington Redskins, has expressed regret that he did not spend more.
“If I could go back, I would invest even more,” Cofield Bowler said.
“I’d probably say at least twice as much.
I was in good health for the first eight years of my career.
It might have been helpful for the end of more procedures.
Ryan Shazier, a 24-year-old back line player, expressed the readiness to step out of his veterans in the footsteps of Stelers teammates.
“If you’re paying $100,000 and earning an additional three million, this decision is quite simple,” Shazier said.
As regards the long-term life of a career, investing in the return of players is much smarter than spending money on cars and villas.
The average NFL player is lucky when he can play longer than 30 years old, the more Harrison's success should convince his colleagues to shift their expenses to another place.
But maybe they can just find a local specialist.
The Weekend Festival Baltic boss Gunnar Viese tells the evening page that the festival was first held years ago from Finland and its owners went to the expansion of the beach bar on Riga, but the return was stopped in Pärnu and the festival was sold to Estonia.
Gunnar says that they have had 25,000 visitors a day, but the chicks are only considered when the festival is over.
Preparation for this year's party began in September.
“We had information from the city about the construction of the last floor, the hotel comes,\" Gunnar said.
Now you don't see any stuff in there, but you think if you don't go to the ground this year, the next one's going.
So maybe we should have moved out of there sometime, she explains why she moved to the festival this year.
The festival will be held for a year.
Weekend has a total of thousands and half of thousands of people - police, management team, volunteers, traders, security team, and so on.
According to Viese, it was difficult for Weekend to get duot The Chainsmokers.
Men are now the undisputed pre-number of pop music.
Why The Chainsmokers were hard to get to Weekend and how Gunnar comments that two artists canceled their performances, see the video.
In response to Ansip, we have done a lot for Estonia’s success.
Vice-President Andrus Ansip of the European Commission said in an interview that he was sad to look at Estonia’s daily policy, as the government of Jüri Ratas has turned to the head of a simple and predictable tax system.
In the paper, you used the chance to ask me what I have done for the success of Estonia and what I can be proud of.
I am delighted that we have been a good team in the government and have made a lot of important decisions in the months we have read, many of which have been expected in Estonia for more than ten years,\" Ratas wrote in social media today.
According to Ratas, these decisions are, for example, a tax reform to increase the income of people, a pension reform for older people to ensure a dignified retirement age, a self-government reform to balance Estonian development, an increase in agricultural support to rural recovery, and, of course, a health reform to provide accessible and high-quality medical care.
\"I wish you a good vacation,\" he wrote in a tour to Ansip in Ratas.
Talents on Pärnu Weekend: drunk man climbed into a foreign car for a dream
At three o’clock last night, the police were faced with a slightly different challenge.
One of the owners of Audi reported that a stranger in a tank at Port Artur had climbed into his car and fell asleep.
A police officer who responded to the event found a man who was scared of himself when the reservators arrived.
The man was tired for a moment on his journey and found a place in the back seat of a stranger man's car.
“A man, after the alarming of the defenders on his own feet, was again on his way home,” describes the West Prefection on Facebook.
The end is good, everything is good!

The stupidest questions to ask the barmen.
Huffington Post conveys questions that they prefer not to hear.
What kind of drink can you do best?
In some drinks, there are actually more ingredients than in the other, but in order to prepare them you need the same skills and insight.
Bar providers often interpret this question as “What’s the easiest/fastest to make at the moment – which gives them signs that the client has anything to drink, make it hard for the barman or not.
What kind of drink do you like the most?
This question is interpreted in the same way that which cocktail would be the easiest to get from the bar right now.
It’s not a bar provider’s thing to say, but the client makes decisions on his own according to the thickness of his wallet.
I would rather wait for the barmen to ask if there are any special offers at the moment.
What's the good thing about this?
Perhaps, behind this question, there is a pure-hearted desire to know whether the bar is distinguished by any offers from others, but it could also be asked differently.
Nor can the barmen know what the client would prefer.
Can I have a drink that wouldn't be very sweet?
Similar to the previous rule, the barmen are not aware of your taste and preferences, and what is sweet for one, it may not be for others.
However, he is ready to listen to what kind of flavors he would like to have on cocktails.
Does this drink cause me to get a headache/pohmel?
The barman is not a medic or a predictor, so he knows how to allow it to the client, hand on the heart.
The cold summer has led Estonians to travel abroad so that package travels are not only expensive, but also sold out regardless of price.
Cheap flights and last minute tickets are not worth it, it is better to think about the next year’s travel plans instead.
The man was hostage selling the model on his dark web.
Polish citizens took a British model hostage in Italy.
A 20-year-old woman in a dark web, or encrypted online auction, said Guardian.
According to police, by July 11, she was lured to Milan with the promise that she would get a job at the photo session.
Instead, he was drugged and taken to a villa near Turin.
The prisoners allegedly tried to sell a woman on a dark web for 230,000 pounds and presented a ransom claim to her model agency.
On July 17, she was taken to the British Consulate.
The police confirms that the Polish citizen Lukas Herba, who lives in Britain, is suspected.
According to Corriere della Sera, the man discovered that the kidnapped woman had a small child and did not want to sell her as a sex slave.
Such experiments attract people.
It would be very good if we had further thought and conclusions.
A recommendation for a friend to explore the background for a little more time is obvious.
In general, however, everyone could have a strategy that he shares about himself in social media.
At national level, however, it is necessary to ask whether officials and politicians are sufficiently aware of the risks posed by social media.
The life of the people who were created under controlled conditions ended with summer school, but they certainly did not.
Sometimes you have to go to the forest for whatever reason.
However, if the coolness between the skin stores, then it is time to make a hot tea drink.
There are enough resources in the forest.
Protect Home! provides a small overview.
We are talking about tea drinks because coffee and tea contain caffeine, which is to some extent addictive, but is not the best thing about our health.
Using plants in free nature, you must always be ready for testing, because both recipes and flavors are different.
Some plants don’t need to boil long, only hot water, while others need to be drawn for hours.
Of course, it must also be attentive that the water and plants are clean enough.
It also depends on the season and place of collection.
Let’s take a closer look at how to make a few simple tea drinks and what effect they can have on us.
Männiokkate
Männinocades can drink peacefully around the year.
If it is good to drink 2 litres of water a day, then it is well suited to meet the need for vitamin C as well as to provide a little extra energy.
As with all plants, it is also possible to obtain useful elements from pine trees using alternative methods, for example by breaking - the beans do not have to boil long, it is enough to pick up hot water and for a few hours to pull out.
For half a litre of water, it takes 0.4 litres of beans to be boiled for 15 minutes.
The result is a drink containing approximately 25 mg of vitamin C, a lot of potassium and zinc.
In addition, the drink contains about 1.5 sugar cubes, i.e. about 20 kcal sugars.
In addition, lemons and honey can always be added to the fruit.
And when the drink got ugly, it can be diluted with water like syrup.
The preparation of lubes goes the same way, but the drink itself tastes a little different.
The raspberry drink is great and helps with a lot of trouble, from rheumatism to varicose veins.
Raspberry helps to overcome fatigue, has a painful effect and helps in cold diseases both as a cough reliever and as a fever suppressor.
Therefore, it would not be worth drinking more than half a litre a day.
The raspberry drink also makes you sweat, so in the winter you should find a calmer moment to enjoy it.
In winter, take fresh raspberries, during summer, use leaves, shoots or berries.
For a half-litre drink, you need a small bouquet of a small branch with a paralytic length, which must be boiled until the water acquires a red tone.
The raspberry can also be drawn.
To do this, break the stalks and keep them in warm water for a few hours.
Longer and more thorough processing also makes the drink stronger.
The finished raspberry drink can also be added to the pine sauce.
Black Pigs
The black nut is a tree that in nature looks like a black-burned piece on the tree.
Most often it is found in the sauces, but also elsewhere.
The fungus area of use is very wide - hot drink, fire ignition, instead of a bug, etc.
The ash can wash itself very well too.
Black peppers are a kind of super drink that can be used for the treatment or relief of very many diseases, even cancer, to increase tone, to reduce stress, to prolong life.
The fungus contains a number of unique compounds and a lot of vitamin B, as well as antioxidants and a little minerals and protein.
Tea made from fungus can drink every day, there is no risk of overuse.
To make a drink, about 3 x 3 cm of fungus is enough to come in 2-3 litres of water to boil for 5-15 minutes.
Prime Minister Jüri Ratas visited Estonia’s fourth-largest island in the context of a tour of small islands, where he met local rural municipality managers and residents to discuss the current topics of island life.
The tour of the island of Vorms started from the port of Sviby, where Prime Minister Rata was welcoming Tanel Viks, the conqueror of Vorms, and Chairman of the municipality council, Ivo Sarapuu.
The first was the historic Church of St. Olavi, and the nearby cemetery, unique in Estonia for its pae and sandstone ring castors.
Following an appointment with the Vorms Children's Garden School, Director Age Hälvin spoke to the Prime Minister about the living conditions of the school and the organisation of study according to which school students are part of the distance learning.
Prior to the afternoon, the Prime Minister completed a new and modern joint operational service building, which was opened in 2015, in addition to a meeting with the island population.
The debate addressed important issues for the population, such as the development of small islands and the development of routes between the continents.
The country has committed to ensuring a regular transport connection for small islands with permanence, but, for example, increasing traffic during the summer period will also make it more difficult for local residents to travel.
These are the places where the country can take local desires and needs into account in the planning process early,\" the Prime Minister said.
In addition, the questions of the construction, interest education, island safety and rescue capacity of the small ships port were discussed.
Today’s visit to Vorms was the last part of the tour of the small islands of the Prime Minister, to explore the island’s living environment, and to discuss issues that await the settlement of local residents and government leaders.
In July, the head of government Ratas Saaremaad, Kihnu, Ruhnu, Abruka and Vilsandi Islands and Maniladu, in August, have visited Naissaart, Prangli and Aegna.
For the first time, the Central Party will go to elections with the founding and ideological cornerstone of the political party.
So far, we said the Central Party and thought about Savisar or vice versa.
Now the Central Party has to find a way without him.
In doing so, they must also stage the party's colorful, sometimes between criminal and embarrassing past, Savisaare party supporters and elector's expectations.
Savisaare's departure puts the most complex situation in the Central Party's ideological plan.
Based on the current policy practice and ideology, it can be said that the old nostril will play them safely.
A number of cards that were previously affected as drums may not be realized this time.
The populism card for the Central Party is not working because Savisar can always be more allowed than the prime party.
Playing on the Russian map is more difficult due to the position of the Central Party in the government and also because we can see here as well how the so-called Savinova electoral union is pushing the bottom of the gas.
The applicant’s card is already in Savisaare’s pocket due to the ongoing legal process.
For the Central Party, there is also a map of the People's Front and the poor.
The first of them is a low value without this creator, and the coalition partners in the government are hindering the second more powerful play.
However, one card can be even more weighty.
All the last elections have confirmed that successful parties are those who can formulate and then implement the main conflict of elections.
There has always been a major conflict around Savisaare.
If some political parties should think of a well-functioning confrontation in life, there is another drum in the map of the Central Party.
So what's left for the Central Party?
They still have a strong partyer and a considerable resource.
Recordings also need to be done before the elections.
The self-reception made by a taxpayer with four years of shame has now been expected to be repaid by most of the Taliban.
Tallinn City Media remains, but the cultivation of political guerilla magazine remains less.
In addition, the party has voice magnets.
Their role this time remains to be the release of the chestnuts from the fire, because the image of the power party is not enough to motivate voters in a meaningful way.
In an ideological plan, Jüri Ratasel must find its way because the journey with savisarity ended this week.
Three U.S. Marines disappeared in the waters of Australia.
The U.S. Marines and Marines stopped searching for an operation, reported the naval base at Camp Butler in Japan in a statement, basically confirming that the military will no longer be able to find the missing ones alive.
The accident occurred with a Marine plane Osprey MV-22, which started on USS Bonhomme Richard.
There were 26 people on board, 23 of whom managed to find and save the plane.
The plane that fell to the sea last month participated in U.S. and Australian joints in Shoalwater Bay, Queensland.
Australian defense minister Marise Payne said that the Saturday incident took place near the coast of Shoalwater Bay.
The woman found a foreign wedding ring in the washing machine - who could it belong to?
“I began to take the washing machine out of the machine when the light washing machine between the rubber strap between my eyes,” the woman told me how she found a foreign wedding ring in her washing machine.
In fact, Karin did not pay any attention to the noise at the door of the washing machine.
I put the machine back on.
“Two little children will get this dirty laundry right away, a woman will be fine.
When I got through the second wash, and started to take out the laundry, the helve of the washing machine between the rubber strap between my eyes and then I found that ring.
The gold to the wedding ring is the name of a married man, Tomi, who married 14 years ago.
Because someone in the family named a man or woman who could be married to some Tom doesn’t know, the ring is a complete mystery.
Karin looked at the parent’s child to find a ring from his yard, put it in his pocket, and the ring has gone into the washing machine through it, but the child confirmed that he had not brought the ring home.
Karin has lived with his partner in the apartment of Madala Street in Tallinn for a year.
They used to rent it out, and the washing machine came from that time.
But if the ring was to be somehow connected to the tenants, how did it get into the machine?
“Now I’m advised and can’t understand the way the ring was to land in the washing machine, a woman laughs.
Since the pace of life next to two little children is quite fast, the finding was initially forgotten at home on the closet.
“In recent times, there have been posts looking for the owner of the wedding ring, and now it seemed that it was time to look for the owner of his own ring,\" Karin said in a social media case where a wedding ring found in Tallinn on the Puhangu Street found a happy week in the owner’s life.
“When different things are found on Facebook and sought, I thought first of all, to try happiness there,” says Karin, whose post has already been shared by nearly 4,000 people.
“The post has received all kinds of feedback and not everyone is good,” she said, referring to the first comments that she was advised to take her husband to the sand.
Then I felt like I needed this shit now.
That my husband has become the greatest traitor ever heard of.
To be honest, it made me worried at first, but later on, when I came to the comments that maybe I had been embroiled with the ring owner, it made me laugh.
Comments also suggested that suddenly the ring reached the woman in the pocket of clothes.
“Well, last time six months ago, some of the pants bought to go to work came in the other round that flew without a more thorough investigation into the washing machine, but do you really think?
Whatever it is, but we agreed with our partner that now, because of the principle, we have to find the ring owner.
Whatever the reason for the loss of this ring.
A divorce, a family holiday or whatever.
I think this is the only thing to do, because if I ever had to lose my wedding ring, I know that I would be grateful to someone who would try to find me and return valuable property.
Karin has also turned to the Family Status Board to get help in finding the owner.
However, I have received a reply that this date in Estonia and that is the name of the gentleman who has not married.
One ring has been found by the owner
Recently, a wedding ring found in Pelguranna on 21 July in Tallinn, which the gravity promised to assume belonged to an elderly woman.
“I walked with dogs in the morning and noticed that I was at the back of 53 houses, inside a paved path, a golden ring,” Gerli said, “that gravity allowed me to assume that it belonged to an elderly woman.
Gerli posted a photo of the ring (picture) on his Facebook page and in the group \"Marked in Tallinn\", shared information with the city district of Northern Tallinn and the northern prefecture.
Two weeks later, the police contacted Gerli and reported that the ring carrier had been identified.
“I got the owner’s daughter’s contact and on Monday night went to the possession of her daughter, the ring was lost, because the old lady had injured her hand and put the ring on the other finger, where it had slipped down.
“He lost it the morning I walked with my dog,” Gerli says.
Although media attention has been paid mainly to Pärnu and its Weekendi, it is not the only music festival for this weekend.
The Insikurmu festival in Põlvamaa also has loyal fans.
One of them writes on Twitter: “I sold the ticket of the Week so that I could go to Insikurmu.”
And why not.
In addition to domestic artists, performers come from America, Finland, Lithuania, Hungary, England and elsewhere.
The festival held in the magical forest surprises artists present there because of their charming location.
One of them, Lucy Rose, couldn’t be surprised at Twitter this morning, how beautiful the place is in Estonia.
But the visitors have not had any kits to share with them.
To become a part of the Insikurmu festival, see also the galleries!
The Estonian U18 summary acknowledged the UK’s best in the semifinal, and the A Division could not be reached.
The match began very fast, and in the first quarter of which the British won with five points (18:23), many baskets were cast.
During the second quarter, the difference increased further, and the holiday break increased in the nine-point success of all the guests (31:40).
Estonia was able to win the third cruiser, but only one point.
The defeat of the Estonians before the last ten minutes was eight points (46:54).
During the fourth quarter, the game of Estonia completely broke down, and ultimately it was necessary to accept the loss with numbers 61:75.
The loss destroyed the Estonians’ hopes of reaching the A-division, because there are only two of the best groups.
In the game of tomorrow's third place, Estonia's matches will go to Croatia - the winner of the game between Israel.
Police are looking for an Estonian cop by a postcard
Europol is hunting for the buffer of the Tallinn Night Club.

Australian leagues stand on the crossroads
Professional sport stands on the crossroads in Australia: some areas have traveled on a corporate path so far that it is too business-oriented to classify sport;
others return to the world of amateurs, which is too sports-centred to consider it a business.
This confusion is demonstrated by the painful delays in reaching a wage agreement with the players, the indemnity of the Australian Ragbi Union (ARU), the rise of the Australian Football Federation (FFA) stakeholders, the difficulties with the ragbile at the meeting of an independent commission, and the indemnity of the Australian Football League (AFL) to be a flag of social justice among the people.
The investment banker and the President of the Australian Sports Committee, John Wylie, have tried to actively lead the Olympicsport to the same path as professional leagues, placing leading places on businessmen who have no basic experience in the field of sport.
Rio Tintot, a mining gypsum who has a reputation for the use of tactics managed by trade unions, was seen as collina CA’s problems in reaching an agreement with Australian Crickets Association (ACA).
CA Chairman David Peever is the former CEO of Rio Tinto Australia and he hired CA to negotiate the salary of the app Rio Tinto Head and Adviser.
However, it would be wrong to think that elite men who have an approach to dealing with critics do not love this sport.
Peever was, for example, a regular visitor to Storm’s home games until he moved to another state.
Nevertheless, harsh negotiations between CA and ACA have left extremely high wages to the impression that Australian summer favorites now belong to more business than sports.
On the contrary, ARU’s incapacitable leader Cameron Clyde’s ability to pick up the Australian Super Rugby team has pushed too back to its roots.
The people of the Ragbi Union now prefer to lonk to the outskirts of the stadium to watch the game between amateur teams, while at the same time looting beer and blaming the hot dog.
Ragbilit boasts that they have the most qualified and versatile management in Australia, but too many failures in meeting the requirements of international partners show that it is still too much of a sport to be a business.
Both Ragbiiga and football have problems with leadership, as stakeholders require more power.
Both too-presidents, John Grant from ARLC and Steven Lowy FFA, have shown that their business skills have not been enough to achieve corporate stability.
Grant, former Kangaroo, managed a successful IT company, but was completely away from the game for 20 years.
It became a value when the newly formed ARLC needed an independent president.
Too many stakeholders, who did not trust each other, decided that no one who has participated in the Commission's work in any way, except as a passive fan in the last three years.
The Pendel, however, has moved too far to the business side and too fans have been looking for a rescuer since then - someone with a history of sport.
Westfield’s foreign investment manager, Lowy’s real FFA chairman’s role from his father Frank, one of Australia’s richest people.
A-Liiga clubs want to be better represented at the Congress that elects the Board.
Their owners lose money, but they believe they are as worthy as Manchester United.
Ironically, the sports and business ethics carried out by FIFA delegates for the end of the sport civil war.
AFL has its own ties with Rio Tinto recently resigned by President Mike Fitzpatrick and former AFL Commissioner Chris Lynchi, a financial manager for mining.
Too much pride is placed on the role of the national leader in promoting gender equality, native and refugee activities and gay rights.
Some candles could suggest that this is done by hiding government aids.
Richard Goyder, president of the AFL, said, “AFL is more than a business, considering how it assists all these communities.”
Goyder is the CEO of Wesfarmers who will soon leave office and the first president of AFL who has not played at the elite level of the game.
Bob Every, chairman of the former Wesfarmers, is active in the board of Cricket Australia.
The definition of members of the board of professional sports is often the importance of independence towards competence.
In the ashes of recruiting business beads, they have forgotten something that could be called to love and passion for sports.
Moreover, many corporate heavyweights are not accustomed to the intensive and sometimes critical monitoring activities of the media.
Something that works in a corporate world may not transfer the sport.
Flynn submitted a revised disclosure report showing additional payments
Michael Flynn, who served for a short time as President Trump’s National Security Adviser, presented a report on the disclosure of improved federal financial information on Thursday, which contains new details of Flynn’s contracts in connection with the transfer of Trump to the Presidential Board, the company related to the Iranian American businessman, and the company’s parent company working for Trump’s campaign.
In a letter sent with corrections, Flynn noted that his initial disclosure reports had been submitted in accelerated circumstances without consultation and review by the White House attorneys and the Government Ethics Board.
According to the letter, Flynn did not receive any attention to others, as he was no longer a White House worker at that time.
Flynn resigned only 24 days after his appointment in the middle of the hearings that he had provided Vice-President Pence with misleading information about his post-election ties with the Russian Ambassador in the United States.
Flynn also received criticism due to external payments made to him during the private sector after the resignation of the post of the Director of the Defence Intelligence Agency in 2014.
In the earlier information published by the House of Representatives, Flynn declared that in 2015, the units involved in Russia received around $68,000 in fees and payments.
In addition to Russian-related income, the information provided on Thursday revealed that Flynn had received at least $5,000 for consulting services in the Middle East nuclear power plant construction project.
Flynn’s work on the project was published earlier, but it was not known that he was paid for it.
The updated information also confirms that Flynn had agreed to cooperate with the SCL Group - at that time Cambridge Analytica British parent company - or Donald Trump's data law firm.
Cambridge i is one of the main donors of the venture fund magnanat Robert L. Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah is an influential conservative financial supporter.
Washington Post announced in February that Flynn was hired as SCL Group adviser.
According to the people who knew his role, Flynn’s goal was to help SCL’s American subsidiary win new public procurement contracts with the United States.
SCL also hired one of Flynn’s former co-worker’s state intelligence executives as a leader in the award of public procurement contracts.
Flynn did not receive any compensation or actual work from the person he knew about his activities.
With new information, Flynn received around $28,000 in the transfer to Trump's presidential office.
The largest published source of revenue is $140,000 for Flynn's work as NJK Holding Corps adviser and consultant in Minneapolis. This company is led by Nasser Kazeminy, a businessman born in Iran and currently living in the United States.
On Thursday evening, the Associated Press announced a statement by the NJK that “in response to the advice of Flynn NJK Holdings on the interest of investment in the company’s securities”
NJK finances the technology company GreenZone Systems, the vice president of which is Flynn.
GreenZone is led by Bán Kian, Flynn’s business partner Flynn Intelis – a company currently under investigation for its role in lobbying on behalf of a company operating in the Netherlands, which is connected to the Turkish government.
Earlier on Thursday, Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the Head of the House of Representatives and the Government Reform Committee, asked Kian to provide information on foreign business contacts and trips to Flynn.
During the earlier security check by Flynn, Kian told military investigators that his partner had several foreign business contacts.
According to Cummings, Flynn told the same researchers nothing about such contacts.
According to a familiar person, Flynn, however, passed a security check at that time.
In August, the lead performer was revived on stage, and the singer was taken to Tallinn with an ambulance.
Ivan reached the end of the set when he was hit by a health hazard.
An ambulance was invited to the place, who massaged his heart for several decades, and the organizer Indrek Ditmann talks to Life24.
“There was a delay in the plan, but the festival goes on, he says and adds: “The public has been informed, of course they also saw everything that took place on the stage.
Currently Ivan is on his way to Tallinn with an ambulance and it is not known whether he will survive or not.
Of course, we hope for the best, says Ditmann.
The witness told Western life that the health hazard was hit by Denisenko during the incident.
First, the man stopped singing, then the pill game began to pass, and the man fell on the plate.
There was a conference on the stage, Jan New Pole, who asked if there was a doctor among the audience.
A little later, he asked to pray for Denisenko.
Ivan Denisenko / Augustiblius
Ivan Denisenko (Ivan Blues) is a well-known Ukrainian artist and cultural character.
Ivan’s musicians began in parallel with his art studies at the Ukrainian National Academy of Art and Architecture.
The university was immediately inspired by his incredibly deep bass and invited to sing the famous folk choir Golden Gate.
In school, he was friends with people who introduced him to the blues and later became his bandmates.
The first concert called Ivan Blues & Friends took place on December 31, 2007 at the Kiev Bar called Rag-Time.
Since then, the band has been operating regularly, performing in clubs, concerts and schools across Ukraine.
English author publishes the book in the back language
“Helping Hand is the first book by Michaels, former BBC editor and mother of two children, previously written by Singapore Tatler.
It took three years to complete the book and is devoted to his Filipino assistants Maricon Espiririlja and Ginalyn Naragi, who help prepare food and keep his son, four-year-old Joseph, and his daughter, eight-year-old Florence.
Helpers he described as “family members” helped to test recipes while writing a book. This is the first book in Singapore, which is published in both English and English.
The Helping Hand is available in bookstores everywhere in Singapore at 39.90 SGD and abroad, including Hong Kong, Dubai, Malaysia, Vietnam and Philippines.
He thought he had a stomach virus from a colleague.
Why were his symptoms so different?
At a traumatic point, he was given a high dose of acetaminophene to lower the fever.
For the rest of the day, he was kept being questioned, stabbed, sorted, and examined.
No test showed anything, but he was not wanted to be sent home.
He understood the reason.
For the last two years, he had taken a drug called etanercept for the treatment of Sjögren syndrome.
This medicine reduces the ability of the immune system to fight infections.
Sjögren is an autoimmune disorder - a rather mysterious disease in which the body’s own white blood cells attack the normal tissue, as if it were an intrusive organism that sown chaos in this case both in the glands that produce tears and spits, as well as in some joints.
Weekly etanercept injections were helpful in reducing his joint pain.
But he knew that because of this drug, he was quite helpless in the event of a serious infection.
When the acetaminophene began to work, the patient felt much better.
Doctors at the trauma station decided to leave him at the hospital for the night.
When it comes to the virus, as the doctors suspected, it will be all right for him the next day and he will be let home.
When Girard first heard of his new patient, he took a course of infections to which people receiving etanercept are susceptible.
That list was long.
The viruses cannot be treated before the diagnosis, so he focused on bacterial infections.
One bacteria that attacks people with immune deficiency is a food-borne list of bacteria.
It is often found in unpasteurized milk and cheeses, and it causes terrible nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea that he did not experience.
Legion disease is another infection that is common among those taking this medicine, but it did not cause cough or shortness of breath.
Even the most common bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus can cause joint infections, but, again, he did not have joint complaints.
Nevertheless, the doctor planned to start a wide-ranging antibiotic treatment that would cover all these threats.
However, at meetings with the patient, he did not seem to be struggling with serious infections.
The traumatic doctors had not given him antibiotics.
The doctor was able to stretch the antibiotic administration and simply monitor and wait, but if the patient had one of the infections he had read about, the treatment could have stopped even a few hours of delay with death.
The situation made it even more difficult that the patient thought he was allergic to penicillin, although he did not remember what happened when he took it.
It created a risk and benefits for the relationship shift.
Generally, the decision to start antibiotic therapy or not with low stakes will change if its consequences may be so dangerous.
He asked the colleague, second resident, to evaluate the patient.
Girard didn't tell his colleague that he was planning an antibiotic treatment, and he just asked to review the patient and give his recommendation.
The college met the patient and agreed.
Although he looked good, he would be practically unprotected in the event of an infection.
The doctor should give the patient antibiotics.
Since a patient has experienced a penicillin allergy, Girard should be allowed to test him to check whether he tolerates a medicine that is not a penicillin, but a close relative.
Girard asked me to give you a test dose.
If he had a serious reaction to the drug, he would have had a rash or his blood pressure would have decreased.
None of them happened.
Therefore, he was given a full dose.
A few hours later, Girard got a call.
The patient’s body temperature had risen to 39 degrees.
He rushed to see the patient.
The patient's face shined from a thin sweat layer and his cheeks were pink.
Although he seemed uncomfortable, his heart and blood pressure were all right.
The doctor thanked himself for giving the patient antibiotics.
He asked to give another dose of Tylenol, and when the patient came over for the last time, he was deeply asleep.
The fire was gone.
The sweaty rubber and the pink cheeks were gone.
The next night, when Girard returned to the hospital for a night shift, he first visited the patient.
He had also received five other patients, but because of this patient, Girard was the most concerned at home after transferring to his daily team.
During the hours he did not see him, his blood organism had grown in the laboratory.
It was too early to say exactly what it was.
It was clear, however, that it was a bacterium that is strong enough to grow quickly by Petri, and that it was not Staphylococcus aureus or legionic disease.
The list of other options was long and none of them actually saw fit.
It took two more days before they could finally identify the bacteria.
It was a list of bacteria.
Girard, like all the others who took care of the patient, was surprised.
As a doctor, you have pictures of the diseases in your head.
For Girard, there was a list of diseases obtained from unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses, causing nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
He worked on this unusual infection even further through the material and found that although people with a normal immune system may experience these symptoms, they usually recover quickly as a patient’s colleague.
In the case of pregnant women, older than 65 years of age and impaired immune system, the infection may, however, be triggered outside the gastrointestinal tract - sometimes without the usual symptoms - and enter the bloodstream.
From there, it can spread over the whole body as a wearer.
This type of infection called invasive listeriosis may end up in up to 30% of patients with this disease at death.
Indeed, although it is not as common as botulism, the listeriosis can be as deadly.
Early antibiotic therapy can save life.
When it comes to food-borne disease, what fed this bacteria?
Although the patient and his colleague had not consumed unpasteurized milk or soft cheeses on their journey, the internet search identified an outbreak of the list of smoked beef in Scotland this summer.
Neither of them had eaten smoked beef, but they ate a bit of smoked salmon.
The exactly where they picked up the bacteria was a secret.
If the medical team knew what was wrong, they were able to adjust the antibiotics.
Her three-week treatment ended in July.
Doctors advised him to take it calmly until the end of the summer, but by now he feels quite well and has returned to the museum and his beloved work.
He was praised for preventing a global cyber attack.
And then he was arrested.
When the malware from Krono was advertised in Russian underground forums for the first time in 2014, the questionable price of $7,000 indicated that selling malware was a profitable undertaking.
Krono was advertised as a hacking tool capable of obtaining data, including usernames and passwords, PIN codes for ATMs and personal information useful for breaking down security issues.
Motherboard announced Thursday that Hutchins was held at Las Vegas Airport after a week of security conferences at Black Hat and Defcon.
He was planning to fly back to his home in the UK.
The security community responded to the arrest of its valued star with admiration and scepticism.
Some warned that claims against Hutchins may harm the relationship between “white – hackers – researchers who are looking for software weak places to identify and resolve problems, not to commit crimes or sow chaos – and law enforcement agencies.
Others were shy about Hutchins being able to create such software as this.
In July 2014, he asked Twitter, and no one had a sample of Kronos, which seems to be a strange prayer when he was the author of the malware himself.
Although the exact details of the connection with Hutchins Kronos malware are not clear, security researchers often ignored legal problems when searching for places that are vulnerable to the computer code.
In recent years, large technical companies have put in place a “wage of mistakes” to formalise the process of reporting and compensating for researchers.
At the Defcon conference, without restrictions on security experts from all over the world, there has also been a tense relationship with law enforcement agencies.
In 2002, the FBI, for example, arrested a Russian cryptist in the Las Vegas hotel room after he published software that could, according to the authorities, undermine the security of certain types of e-books.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation said in his statement that he was concerned about the arrest of Hutchins and looked into the matter more closely.
WannaCry’s ransomware infected the computers that used the older versions of Microsoft Windows.
After the spread, encrypted software computers and locked users’ files, folders and disks.
When the infected device was connected to the network, other devices on the network could also be infected.
The attackers demanded that the victims pay hundreds of dollars to the bitcoin address.
Hutchins became a random hero.
In an interview with the Guardian in May, Hutchins said that he registered a web domain after discovering that malicious software is trying to connect with it.
By registering the domain for $10.69, he launched a so-called kill switch that stopped the software from spreading.
His original intention was not to stop the attack, but to monitor its spread.
Hutchins, who works as a Kryptos Logic researcher in the cybersecurity company in Los Angeles, said in an interview that he did not go to college and has learned to write his own software.
The company did not give its comments.
Hutchins tried to remain anonymous, communicating with the media through his grip on MalwareTech, but the British tabloids revealed his identity.
He was promoted to the cybersecurity community for its achievement and received special recognition at the SC Awards Europe industry event.
The Senate confirmed Woody Johnson, the Ambassador of the New York Jets in the UK
Johnson was Trump’s biggest financial supporter during the presidential campaign and was appointed the financial leader of his inaugural committee in November.
Long-term Republican donor Johnson also helped collect money for George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney when they were party candidates.
During the 2016 campaign, he previously served as the financial manager of Jeb Bush.
Johnson’s grandfather set the foundation for Johnson & Johnson, a company producing medical supplies.
Previously, the United States Ambassador was Matthew Barzun.
Barzuni appointed Barack Obama in 2013 and resigned from his post in January of this year before Trump was sworn in.
Belgian officials already knew about egg contamination in June
“We already knew about the potential problems with the insecticide fiprone at the beginning of June,” said the Belgian Food Safety Agency spokesperson Catherine Stragier, a television channel VRT.
We immediately began the investigation and talked about it to the prosecutor's office, because it could have been a fraud.
From there, the investigation became secret.
We understand that people have questions about health and are trying to answer them,” Stagier added.
The news agency AFP tried to get information from the prosecutor involved in the matter in recent days, but it didn’t say anything because the investigator banned the publication of the information.
The eggs have been removed from the market as a precautionary measure in Belgium until the results of the analyses are clear.
Millions of Dutch eggs are removed from the Netherlands and Germany.
The German Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt has called on the Dutch and Belgian officials to quickly clarify the matter.
“No one has obviously contaminated eggs with a criminally prohibited product,” said the German newspaper Bild.
According to the Estonian Veterinary and Food Board (VTA), eggs produced in the Netherlands are unlikely to be present in Estonia.
“We don’t have Dutch eggs in Estonia,” said VTA press representative Martin Altraja’s DNS.
He added that there are also no other products produced in Estonia from Dutch eggs.
According to Statistics Estonia, eggs have not been imported from the Netherlands in the last 10 years.
The last one was brought from the Netherlands to Estonia in 2006.
The Dutch authorities suspect that the pesticides on fiprone reached the channels as a result of the attempt by the Dutch company Chickfriend to treat those suffering from the disease.
The reports from the Dutch and Belgian media that the substance containing pesticides reached Chickfriend through the Belgian company are still unconfirmed.
According to the World Health Organization, fipronine is moderately dangerous and can adversely affect people, especially children, kidneys, liver and thyroid glands.
Is there finally a solution to avoid the annoying robot calls?
For Michael Rizzo, answering the phone is often a waste of time.
Her Buffalo New York Sports City Pizza Pub depends on customers calling and ordering chicken wings, pizza, and potatoes.
Most of the time, however, is automatic messages that try to push the fraud through.
“It’s getting to the point that it doesn’t allow other callers to catch us,” the 24-year-old bar owner said.
Help is on the way, though slowly.
In the last year, the government has been inspired by mobile phones to prevent unwanted “robot calls.”
The Federal Communications Commission has proposed to allow phone companies to block more spam calls and hope to cheat fraud with large fines.
Experts say these steps are not the final solution, but they are a good start.
Federal and State Non-Call Lists should protect people from unwanted calls from remote distributors.
But the traitors don’t care that they violate the law.
Cheaters reach people cheaply and easily, using “auto-choicers” that automatically make a lot of calls at once.
Americans are estimated to receive tens of millions of robot calls a day.
Not all of them are, of course, deceptive.
Pharmacies, for example, send automated messages about the performance of prescriptions.
However, too often, the situation is as follows: you owe the tax office money; Microsoft calls to fix your computer; free cruises are offered!
In addition, spam players use complex technology that shows a local or important number as a phone caller, such as the Tax Board.
The implementation of appropriate measures for numbers intended to be used would make fraud more difficult and would help consumers in the United States keep millions of dollars in total, as claimed by the FCC Group of State Prosecutors.
Phone companies and independent apps can screen or block unwanted calls, compared to databases of known problem numbers and analysing suspicious behavior, such as a number that calls many people in non-call lists.
Management-free service providers also have tools that add alerts to incoming calls such as “Probably fraud” but are not available on all phones or to many customers with prepaid cards.
Verizon and Sprint can be ordered for an additional fee.
Some Android phones, including Google Pixel, are streaming spam calls for free.
Multimedia producer Jen Vargas (39) from Orlando, Florida, said that his AT&T app is marking and blocking certain fraudulent calls on his mobile phone, but he has abandoned his phone lines.
“I rarely receive calls from numbers I don’t know,” Vargas said.
Applications like YouMail and Nomorobo offer free but limited relief to home phones.
In the case of YouMail, the operator must allow the “Tagical Calls” to be redirected to the calls if the call is not answered or is busy.
Nomorobo is not available for all domestic telephone service providers and does not work with older, copper-based telephone lines.
It is also possible to buy gadgets, some of them quite green, which block calls on home phones.
Verizon also tests the display of warnings about suspicious calls on home phone numbers.
Phone companies can already block certain calls that are fraudulent.
The FCC has proposed rules to formalize such practices and to allow other suspected calls to be blocked.
This means that Verizon may block a tax-free number that will receive calls for payment, but never initiates any of its own.
Operators would also be able to block calls where they know that they are not legal numbers, such as 911.
These rules still need to be completed.
Maureen Mahoney, an aspirant of public policy in a non-profit consumer union, said that these developments are \"predictable\", but do not protect consumers from all unwanted calls.
First of all, non-call lists are not applied to certain types of callers, such as debt collectors and political campaigns.
In addition, the FCC rules would only cover counterfeit numbers according to Mahoney.
Not all robotic calls are meant to be bullied.
The Union of Consumers wants phone companies to make call blocking tools available free of charge to all consumers.
In the long run, FCC supports industry efforts to confirm that the caller is really the one who claims to be.
Perhaps one day you can see a green bird on the smartphone screen when the caller is following the right.
U.S. Telecom says that it may take several years to introduce it, but it would be a powerful tool against robots.
The FCC is also looking for ways to stop following annoying calls to consumers who exchange numbers.
If you register yourself in a non-call list now, but get yourself a new number later, the distributor may not know and may start to bother on the new line.
“Robot composers are nowhere to disappear,” said Aaron Foss Nomobos, a service to block calls for mobile and home phones.
“They are criminals and find a new way to go through any system.
But our job is to make it as complicated as possible for them.
There are several logical measures that consumers should take.
Don't answer the phone if you don't know the number.
Unfortunately, this is not practical for business lines like Sports City.
Cancel unwanted calls.
Do not speak or press any buttons.
If you communicate with them, they can note you to someone who responds and bury you under more calls.
If possible, block the number after the call.
Use call blocking apps.
If you have concerns about privacy, check the application rules to see if it shares your call or contact information with distributors.
Do not provide callers with personal data such as bank account or social security number.
Rasmus Mägi: The preparation has not gone exactly as I saw in the spirit eye
“Not everything has been the way I saw it in the spirit eye,” said Mägi MMi of pre-workouts.
Friday is an important moment that shows exactly how the body is.
And the competition will show us what we're going to analyze here anyway.
Today, I believe that my preparation has been of high quality both this year and in previous years, so that it is possible to run normally on all of this.
Nothing special has been done on Sunday by the time of Estonia on 13.05 following the start of the pre-season Mägi.
In the last few weeks, too many trainings are done.
I should have freshness and it could be very useful that the last week before the MMI was a little lighter.
The days left on the physical side of the stadium are like this: yesterday the barrier drinker rests, today it makes a warm exercise.
In his spiritual preparation, however, he does not want to be very entrenched: “I have not developed my own routines in time.
There's a lot of quietness and peace, and I don't let any rock music in my ears.
I do not need to watch any motivating videos or read self-help students, but to be here and at this time to assess that athletes from all over the world have come together to compare their abilities in one place.
This already creates a speciality in itself.
The World Championship is a major event for every lightweight athlete, and every previous start, including the competitions in the Diamond League, has been tested - tried by some technical nuances, compared to some of the competitors.
The title competitions no longer have the opportunity to experiment.
“Here’s the goal of just running quickly,” says Mägi, but adds that if the pre-driving and potentially semi-finals succeed in maintaining either a percentage or a few energy reserves, they will certainly come in favor of the next run.
The Finns had a dance party for their men.
When the first men's dance party was held in Rakvere 11 years ago, the organizers probably couldn't even dream of seeing the North Neighbors take an example of a small town in Estonia.
Today, however, the first men's dance party in the West Finland is held in Lapland.
“The representatives of the town of Lápua were so inspired by the men’s dance party in Rakvere in the last friendly town that they wanted something similar to themselves,” said Kairi Pihlak, Mayor of Rakvere.
“So today, in Finland’s Lapua baseball stadium, Finland’s 100 festivals, 2 shows of the Male Dance Party, including 100 men from Virumaa, said Pihlak.
According to Pihlak, this is an excellent example of good cooperation between two friendly cities.
It also celebrates the Jewish years of the Republics of Estonia and Finland.
A hundred dancers also have the Rocket 69 over-age winner in Karl Reinkubja.
“It is an honor to be one of the hundred men who, with their participation in Finland, shows what Viru’s men are capable of,” he said.
“The men dancing in Rakvere have put all their members on the agenda when preparing for the dance party of Finnish men to show a decent level with the Nordics,” said Ain Nagykaev, a member of the Rakvere City Government.
Viumaa's men's performance has been made as a whole by the dance ensemble Tarvanpää's artistic director Tiiu Mürk, together with the well-known choir leader Elo Üyoja.
The estonian choreography is based on Estonian choral music.
The first Estonian men’s dance party was held in 2006, but so far the last in Rakvere in 2015.
In the expectation of the final air supply: Does Gerd Kanter make MM history?
The current MM is the eighth for Kanter, and none of his competitors in London have reached such a achievement.
In addition, Kanter is the only chainmaker through history who has won a full set of medals (gold, two silver and two bronze) from MM.
As of August 5, 2017, Kanter is 38 years old and 92 days old.
If an Estonian throws himself into a double world champion, he will be the oldest chainmaker who has won the gold medal on the World Cup.
The same option is available for the Polish man Pyotr Malachowski (aged 34 years and 60 days).
More exciting facts:
More than once, only two national athletes have become the world champion.
There are nine gold medals in Germany, two in Lithuania.
The World Championships record belongs to the name of Virgin Alekna, which has been released in Helsinki (in 2005) in 70.17.
The lowest result that has been won on the title is 66.20 – this was accomplished by Riedel in 1991.
The results of the investigation show that the prusas can also be applied to seeds
Like birds and mammals, cockroaches also spread.
These insects are mainly known as decayers, which help to decompose the substances that fall under the forest.
They also help to spread the seeds.
Japan’s researchers have discovered that cockroaches play an important role in the distribution of seeds to the forest species Monotropastrum hop.
This is an unusual plant.
It does not contain chlorophyll, so it is not capable of photosynthesis.
Instead, the species becomes its nutrients from the growing fungi under the ground.
The plant stores small odorless and pale white fruits on the bottom of the forest.
The fruits have very little taste or lack of taste, and Japanese scientists found that the species of birds and mammals are not interested in them as a source of food.
Only a handful of spines consumed the pulp and forest bush Blatella nipponica was the only species that regularly visited the fruits.
The researchers checked the feces to determine if these insects help to spread the seed of the plant.
The researchers found that every fecal tomp left after eating the fruit contained an average of three seeds.
Further tests confirmed that most of the seeds were viable.
Scientists assume that this unique plant species is likely to have learned the ability to propagate prucian seeds during evolution.
The fruits of the plant hang close to the ground and they are ready at the same time that the cockroaches leave their hostilities.
The researchers published their findings this week in the Botanical Journal of the Linean Society.
“In view of the fact that some 4600 species of fur have been identified so far, the distribution of seeds through the cockroaches can be a much more extensive and yet simply undocumented mechanism, not simply the unique skill of a particular plant species to exploit the cockroaches,” said the co-author of Nato Sugiura, Kumamoto University in the press release.
“It is expected that the published findings will encourage people to pay more attention to the relationships between plants and cockroaches and to look for more examples of how the prudder seeds are spread.”
The Duke of Cambridge’s childhood friend should have “the right to die”
A childhood friend with a fatal illness in the Duchess of Cambridge should have been allowed to end his life, according to his mother.
Isobel Kennedy, who was a member of the Duchess’ Gaid Group, begged him to die after three years of struggle with a brain tumor that caused him “extreme pain, suffering, and dignity.”
A 34-year-old female with cerebral cures was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2014, but she suffered a terrible illness before she died in May.
Christine Eeley, 65, Newbury Berks has called for a change in the law that would allow people with fatal illness and spiritually competent to control their deaths and age.
He said that the painful death of his daughter caused him “a serious trauma,” and he wished that the law would have allowed him to put in place a plan that would have allowed his daughter to die with dignity when his condition deteriorated.
Chinese internet sensors play a complex cat and mouse game
According to experts, the shift that can affect users from scientists to companies suggests that China is increasingly concerned about the Internet’s power of influence.
“It seems that the restrictions are becoming more intense, but at the same time the internet is more powerful than ever,” said Emily Parker, who wrote the book “Now I Know Who My Comrades Are” about the influence of the internet in China, Cuba and Russia.
The restrictions imposed on the Beijing Internet are in proportion to the influence of the internet in China.
According to experts, Chinese control has not yet been fully strengthened, and in many cases the cat and mouse game will continue.
One day after Apple’s move last week, people began to spread Chinese social media in ways to get access to those tools that are so simple that it can even be a technical wizard.
This included the registration of a person’s app store in another country where VPN applications are still available.
However, a Thursday test shows that China wants to change the game in favour of the cat.
Several Chinese internet service providers said Thursday on their social media accounts, websites or emails that Chinese security officials would test a new way of finding online addresses for services that would host or use illegal content.
If they have been found, the authorities ask that Internet service providers require their customers to stop doing so.
If customers continue, service providers and Chinese officials will interrupt their connection minutes.
The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a faxed request for comments on the matter.
Research suggests that tens of millions to hundreds of millions of people in China use VPNs and other types of software to get past the Great Firewall.
Although foreign television and pornography blockages eliminate many people, they pose only minor challenges to the large community of online users in China.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has been responsible for the new control elements of the Internet over the years, but he has also highlighted technology and the internet as critical factors for future economic development in China.
Since cyberspace has started to play a more central role throughout China, the control elements of the government have developed.
It is difficult to find out the extent of new efforts, since many users and companies do not discuss them publicly, fearing to become a party to the government of China.
However, some frequent users have said that avoiding restrictions is becoming more difficult.
One of the students who studied in the United States and returned to China for a summer vacation said he had been blocked by the local VPN.
He took this period away from social media as a particular type of meditation, and he left a message to his friends to explain why he was falling underground.
The doctoral degree in environmental engineering in China said that without Google it has become more difficult to do research, although the university has found alternative publications that students would not always need the internet.
He said that he has now found a new way to go through the Great Firewall without disclosing what is being done.
According to Chinese internet observers, some VPNs are still working and China could do much more to intensify restrictions.
“We believe that if the government had decided to do so, it would have stopped the use of the VPN much more today,” VPNada said, a website created in 2015 to help Chinese users find VPNs working, a representative.
“If the government had sent out more cats, the mice would have a lot more complicated,” said a representative who refused to call himself in China because of the delicateness of the group’s work.
“I mean, they didn’t do it because they have to leave a little room for breathing for people or businesses.”
China’s online restrictions are often cyclical.
The current atmosphere is partly due to the recent important meeting of the Communist Party of China, which is the 19th Congress of the Party in autumn.
Five years ago, VPN was hit by unexpected interruptions before the same meeting.
Like economic policy or foreign affairs, censorship in China is also part of a complex and often incomplete political process.
According to analysts, government ministries feel pressure from the party's Congress to show that they are effective and can intervene in the event of a problem.
“This is certainly not a VPN apocalypse,” said Paul Triolo, the chief of the Eurasia Group’s global technology department.
“A more complex environment and new opportunities and approaches for the navigation of visitors will allow China to simply turn off certain parts of the VPN usage at the time and place of Beijing’s choice,” he said.
In the past, the Chinese population learns to cope with these difficulties.
Earlier this summer, the Chinese internet giant Tencent began to limit the time during which younger than 18 people are allowed to play a popular online game “Honor of Kings,” allowing it to do an hour a day for those younger than 12, and two hours a day for those who are 12-18 years old.
Therefore, Chinese young people have started using a gyvan solution - fake documents.
“Will your “Home of Kings” playtime be limited?
Whether you’re interested in getting a document that shows that you’re older than 18 – recently asked about advertising in China’s social media.
“It’s not a problem.

Estonian heavy-duty horses will be evaluated tomorrow at the Farm Museum
On this Saturday, August 5, the Estonian Farm Museum of Agriculture will take place on the Day of Heavy Trucks in Estonia.
The Estonian heavy-duty horse is one of three Estonian horse breeds next to the Estonian horse and horse horse.
The day of heavy-duty horses will take place 23 times this year and 17 heavy-duty horses from over Estonia will arrive at the event of the year of work.
This day, young people are compared and evaluated for heavy-duty horses, cues and welds in Estonia.
In addition, the work carried out by the best breeders is recognised.
The endangered breed is more than 350 heavy-duty horses in Estonia.
The preservation of the breed and the use of horses are also introduced in Ülurmel.
On the same day, it is possible to visit Estonian Agricultural Museum exhibitions, to explore EV100 cereal bushes and cane crops and to participate in thematic workshops.
The activity is found by visitors of all ages.
There are exciting games for children, the opportunity to ride with a pony or horse, take part in a drawing competition and visit the Three Spider Science Theatre.
There is also a summer meal where Estonian food and handicraft goods are offered.
The day of heavy-duty horses in Estonia is organised jointly with the Estonian Breeders Society, Estonian heavy-duty horse breeders and the Estonian Agricultural Museum.
Breeders are supported by the Estonian Society of Breeding.
Cat Genie was named a cat of the year
The saved cat, who was in support of its owner during the treatment of bone cancer, was named the country's year of cat.
Genie was recognized for comforting her owner, Evie Henderson from Lincoln (11), during six chemotherapy sessions.
Evie was diagnosed with bone cancer in March 2016 and, according to her, the Genie Society helped her deal with several painful operations and a long time spent in the hospital.
Cats Protection is recognised by the Cats Protection in London.
Description: According to Evie, the cat was there for her when she lost her long brown hair due to chemotherapy
“I think he’s the best.
He deserves it.
He has always been there for me,\" Evie said.
“He came to my foot and sat next to my feet.
He smelled the plaster and then jumped on the couch to pat on my knee with his hands.
When I was too sick to be able to visit or go out, and I had to sit at home, he came to me, and it made me much happier, offering great comfort.
According to Evie, he has a special connection with his pet, which was a huge support for him when he lost his hair due to strenuous treatment.
“It really took me out because I had long brown hair.
But since it was spring, Genie used the same hair, and the fact that I lost my hair, and Genie's own, slightly eased the whole shock.
Evie’s father, Chris Henderson, said that the cat had been a “great attention diffuser” and described how Evie used to watch her favorite videos in a hospital bed.
\"Evie was in the hospital for over 300 days, so we spent a lot of time there, and it offered her something to wait for when she got home for a few precious days.\"
11-year-old said: “I missed him every day when I was in the hospital, and my family said that he would miss me too.
He's my best friend, and I really don't know what I'd do without him.
Report: Mueller convened a jury in a study related to Russia
The Wall Street Journal announced Thursday that a special prosecutor investigating possible ties between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign has convened a jury.
The newspaper reports that the jury is a new and significant advance in the research activities of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, as regards whether Trump or his main advisors held a conspiracy to promote the 2016 Republican presidential campaign with Moscow.
NBC News has previously announced that before Mueller, the former FBI director, who now conducts this critical investigation, was appointed, state prosecutors had used former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort as part of the investigation.
One of the president’s personal lawyers, John Dowd, told NBC News that he was not aware that Mueller had started using the entire jury.
“We’ve been working with Bob Mueller and his team since 1 June, because we want to get to one side of this thing,” he said.
“There is no reason to believe that President Trump is under investigation from the background of the entire news of the federal conspiration.”
NBC News has not independently verified the Journal data.
The use of the jury is a common part of a complex investigation, and it is not a tool designed to only listen to certificates, but also to receive information and obtain data from individuals or companies.
This is a powerful tool that prosecutors can use to apply for accusations and lawsuits, and this may indicate that Mueller’s work has not been far from done.
Trump has denied that he or any member of his team had planned a plan with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Moscow officials have also denied the role of playing Trump’s surprising victory in November of last year.
President Ty Cobb said he was not aware that Mr Mueller has started using the new jury.
“The contemplation of the conspirators is usually secret,” Cobb said in a statement.
The White House is in favour of everything that accelerates the fair completion of his work.
The White House is fully committed to cooperating with Mueller.
Former FBI Director Jim Comey has said three times that the president is not under investigation, and we have no reason to believe that things have changed.
\"A flying American – under a black sail
Of course, I have heard of “flying” ships.
Who wouldn't be?
The Tiiburs go several times a day between Tallinn and Helsinki.
It's nothing special.
The Swiss company Supramar brought the first \"foiliva\" boat, Freccia d'Oro or Golden Arrow on the market in 1952.
Technology had existed before, but now I am facing the wind's moving base.
A cataract, but still a sailboat.
What formula should this air rise?
Let us, however, save ourselves from lying (it is not difficult to find) and let us throw a simple look at the concept of “foiling” as a peasant.
Why do planes stay in the air?
The shape of the wing is such that when the plane continues to feed at high speeds, the air flowing under the wing and above at different speeds due to the difference in pressure due to the aerodynamic lifting force, at one point, it exceeds the weight of the plane and lifts the entire machine into the air.
In essence, the same process is also carried out in water.
With the right shape, the wing creates lifting force at high speeds, and in turn lifts the “vertical” base out of the water.
It's easy, isn't it?
It gets complicated when it comes to numbers.
The aircraft needs a minimum of 150-250 km/h to air, and the world record of the speed of sailplanes is now – 121.1 km/h.
Let's not get into high school physics.
Today I have come to see the “flying – catamaran, which bears the name NACRAF20 Carbon FCS.
NACRA is a member of the North American Catamaran Racing Association.
FCS is a short flight control system.
This is a system that allows the team to set the base in the middle of the flight, and 20 shows the length of the sailboat on the feet.
As soon as the catamaran is released from the cover, it is clear that this is not the holy pilgrimage of the gentleman.
Dr. Monokkel and Captain Sametves stayed on the clock today.
The pipe and the glasses were not on board.
This is hardcore.
It's the speed in the cube.
“It’s carbon, I ask by pointing to the sail.
Yeah, it's all carbon.
“I don’t really understand.
“No, the whole boat, sounds like a missing answer.
170 kilos - The three of us on board will certainly weigh more than 170 kilos.
I'm comparing everything from the pessuous to the evening cars, and I can't get around it here, NACRA F20 is like an unsuited front armpit.
Pagan Zonda R or Ferrari FXX.
Designed for a specific purpose - drive in controlled conditions very quickly.
The host hobby driver would also be cooled by the amount of security equipment that needs to be driven on his back before going to the sea.
Waterproof suit, warlocks, special-catching priests, sail gloves, cells, special life jacket, helmet.
In the battle equipment, it becomes a feeling that, in addition to the oxygen balloon and as well as the sea, Mars could be colonized.
“It’s a big chance to go around, I ask a joke.
“Yes, it sounds a short answer.
\"You've been around a lot, I'm still rolling the surface.
Well, that can't be a joke.
I'll fix the seat belt.
The aim is also stressed by the fact that Nacra F20 FCS needs a helping boat and a minimum of two crew members to reach the sea.
Maximum of three, so there is not much room.
It's starting to wonder why it's not a Sunday cruiser.
Leil Forest Stories – Blog Archive – Repair of roads and roads
Once in a while, all kinds of land improvement work will remain in my eyes, whether in the forest or in the field.
Machines and quality of work have significantly improved and everything is done more efficiently than at its own time.
Currently, land improvement objects are mainly reconstructed, errors and blockages are sought and repaired.
The toughest environmental requirements have been added, which has not been paid attention for decades ago.
Construction materials, for example, are now used instead of previous iron concrete pipes, and for the protection of the tap handles, in addition to the stones, the so-called geotextile is used.
In the past, the doors and drums were covered with concrete plates (MP, VKP) and rots.
In order to protect the environment, sediments are extracted before reaching the natural streams or rivers of dry water (ground Drenes, Bars) that should clean water from possible residues of fertilizers and poisons.
The bottom of new sets of swimming pools or ponds is often planted with wolves or they begin to grow themselves from the seeds flying there.
In wolves, the property has the ability to filter out toxic substances from water.
The pond in the picture was dug last year and this week on the surface of the pond was flat, the concrete ring well was built to take fire water.
And so that some machines would not rush into the pond, it was enough to spend large stone shells at the side of the plateau.
In the surrounding area, along with cleaning of land graves, the improvement of forest roads is also on hand.
The interracial road section in the picture should be part of the terrain, which can also be added to the roses.
On the right, the state forest, which is reconstructed by the road to the right of the calorie, will soon be completed.
There's a private forest on the left.
The Vallate road continues, and there is also an update of the agricultural graves and roads, and the improvement of the droughts that have become apparent.
