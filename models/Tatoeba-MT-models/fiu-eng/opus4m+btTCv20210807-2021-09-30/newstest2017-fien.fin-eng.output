The 28-year-old chef was found dead at the shopping mall in San Francisco
The 28-year-old chef who moved to San Francisco was found dead from the top gate of the local shopping center this week.
However, the victim's brother says that he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him, and says, \"His business finally went well.
The body found at the Westfield Mall shopping centre on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Sanfranciscolic Frank Galicia, San Francisco's death investigation agency.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was determined as a criminal offence and that the investigation was ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABC channel in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a bus stop in Boston, had received his dream job as a bus chef at the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The representative of Sons & Daughters said that they were “suffered and shocked” because of his death.
“We have a small team that works like a tight family, and they’re going to miss him very much,” the representative said.
We send our thoughts and regrets to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was staying at the beginning of the hostel, but that recently, his business finally went well.
\"He found the apartment and met a girl,\" Louis Galicia told the KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good-willed and had a big heart.
His way of feeling the unity with the family was to make us food, make dinner,\" Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of disputes.
He was a brother who was driving with the river.
“In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a diamond that shined brighter every day,” he said.
All those who have information about this will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's tip line to number 415-575-4444.
Doctors on strike: Requirements for new work-fighting measures
Doctors’ representatives have asked their trade unions to accept new work-fighting measures in their dispute regarding the new agreement.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) calls on the entire Council to support new work-fighting measures from the beginning of September.
JDC says that ministers have failed to take care of the agreement.
Doctors and medical students voted to reject the agreement agreed with BMA in July.
58% of voters rejected it.
On Thursday evening, in a letter published through Twitter to the members of the JDC president Ellen McCourt, said that the government had remained “separately silent” on the issues which, he said, led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: “In this light, the Government of the JDC has voted to reject the proposed new agreement and to demand formal renegotiation of all your concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain a mandate for the gradual and expanding work struggle programme that will begin early in September.
The debate has been followed by the fact that medical practitioners have participated in six strikes this year, including the first complete workout in the history of the NHS health care system.
The head of BMA medical practitioners, doctor Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote had been rejected after the agreement had been negotiated, under the conditions recommended by BMA.
He had told members of the BMA at meetings before the vote of 54,000 medical practitioners and students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would be imposed on the doctors of England.
Russia and Turkey: an external association?
Ele, who ended up in a crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday in order to make each other known and declare that the fight between eight months of words and economic sanctions was officially over.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of the Palace of St. Petersburg, I was clearly impressed by the desire for this reconciliation in Ankara.
Yes, the event was dealt with.
But Putin's smile looked violent, and he hardly threatened heat, even according to his own controlled standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, kept talking about his “loved friend” Putin, five times, according to a report.
I got confused in the bills.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even to the better.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan's behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his zeal represented the opposites.
But the vileys that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft at the border of Syria.
Moscow's reaction at that time was a waste of time.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabging Moscow on his back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
Over the months, the media ruled by the state led to an insurrectionary, in-depth attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed like the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious accusations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in the Syrian territories controlled by Isis.
He has banned it hard.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting happened only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia achieved some kind of victory.
The benefits of ankara's ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost out of power in the failed coup of the last month.
The ongoing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been severe, especially for charter flights, which generally carry millions of Russians to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In the case of Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines are certainly relieved when flights are finally continuing.
They want a late season rush to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state television has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables since the import of agricultural products from Turkey is allowed again.
“You brought the tomatoes back here, like the Vedemosti newspaper’s report.
But there was also political added value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
As the long-lasting deal of the EU membership negotiations has been added, Mr Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the coolness and to undermine Turkey's ties to the Western countries.
The Russian leader was sure to get out of Ankara, where he called after the revolution attempt to support the appointed authorities.
Of course, this is a survival for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of changing power.
So, this meeting in the French sea scene allowed Russia and Turkey to introduce an external alliance, as an analyst described the situation for me: two countries that experience abandoning them and treating them incorrectly, combining their power.
However, these two have great differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently agreed to the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It could be a lot of talk that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed the issue.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear understanding of where they can find a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and having taken into account the possibility of a full-blown disaster, a Turkish member of NATO, when shooting down a Russian combat plane, it is certainly better that the two leaders are once again speaking.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from non-Scotland customers
According to the Bank’s CEO, the RBS brand is reduced to back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand joined the Bank's international goals.
Since the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and it had to be saved, it has abandoned these goals.
The Bank's strategies have used the RBS brand to protect other consumer finance brands at this time.
It was supported by millions of international sports sponsorships, Six Nations rubby Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it is considered right to let national brands come to the forefront.
Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it is not re-opened.
All RBS references in England and Wales except for the main office and stock exchange listings will be converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for Irish and Northern Ireland customers.
There are other smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwania was interviewed in a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: “RBS brand becomes our investor brand and our employees’ employer because we now become a lot more brand bank.
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and it has increased the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It is now time for us to move towards the bank of brands, because in essence (we’ve been asking questions) it’s about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers,” the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we’ve done, focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I believe you’ll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettor wins in Newmarket with Predilection and wins 3,000 wins
Dettor sprays champagne after having a total of 3,000 wins after a double win.
The racer, Frankie Dettor, confirmed his 3,000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the milestone with his second victory on his home track in his competition with John Gosden’s coached Predilection.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches this milestone in the race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
Three-time masterjockey Dettor, who previously won at Ghayyar, said: “This is special.
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettor sucks his own charms when he brings the Predilection out after victory.
Two racers have reached this milestone in the contests - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time master Sir Anthony McCoy, who had records in his breaking career over 4300 wins.
Master Piggot, 9 times Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racers of the present era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which only few have reached before him.
He's elegant and strong, but his tactical intelligence separates him from the rest of the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador to competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have been pulling fans into the species for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have been riding with 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big race!
Speaking seriously, Frankie has been riding the winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a vibrant person who is a good thing for British competition, but in addition he is an amazing jockey.
Frankie Dettor celebrated the milestone with a flying landing on the saddle.
From flying to flying landings, Frankie Dettor has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a mountain ride.
Profits in big races, including his famous “Magnificent Seven” victory in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and suffered a ban on competition due to drugs.
Three years ago, he was difficult at first when he returned after six months of competition, but he showed significant character strength when challenging suspects and returning to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettor has said before that he would like to continue to compete until at least 50 years old.
Russian Putin separates chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly resigned Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport matters.
The Kremlin's opinion stated that Putin has ordered Ivanov to move away from the duties of the Russian Presidential Government, but was not justified.
Ivanov's Deputy Director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the President's protocol and government staff, said on the Kremlin's website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin: “Thank you for your trust.
I think the main task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state, as regards the draft laws and the management of the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his place and recommended that Vauno be named for his place.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies and, like Putin, worked at the Security Service of the Soviet Union KGB.
He was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on the television of the state, both men claimed that the chief of staff withdrew from their request.
But despite the smile of cameras, only a few here are convinced - especially now, just before the elections.
Is this just some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man once advertised as a potential candidate for president suddenly wants to lead to Russian environmental policy has been taken seriously.
In his comments to Putin on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, “It is true that in 2012 I asked you to give me this very complex responsibility for four years in the debate, perhaps even to say the work, the task.
Well, now I've been chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service at the KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the State Security Service in FSB, which replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy director.
When Putin rose to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Putin after the second period, because Putin’s third term would have been anti-constitutional.
However, this task went to the other Putin’s close ally, Dmitry Medvedeville.
Putin became Prime Minister only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson received shoes after he hit the producer
Gibson was involved in the physical dispute last month at a series of shooting sites in Los Angeles.
A series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his resignation in a joint opinion.
Mr Gibson, acting as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, made an apology on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
There were creative differences and controversy at the location.
I regret that it happened, he said in his statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character is removed from the series of FBI agents are expected later.
The 54-year-old Dharma & Greg has been involved in the series since its first season in 2005.
“I love the Criminal Minds series, and I’ve given it everything for the last twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement on Friday.
I wanted to be there until the end, but it's not possible now.
I just want to thank the authors, producers, actors, our incredible team, and above all the best fans that the series can have.
The beginning of the 12th production season of the series has been planned for the 28th of September.
Mysteries ended up in the garden in Banff
The man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windmills left behind by a round of water.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published a film on the manifestation in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of fish in two inches.
Queensferry Crossing
The project of £1,35 billion is now expected to be ready by May 2017
The engineers have combined Queensferry's crossing point with the north deck as well as the bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fifee.
It is the first between the four feathers and the covers that are now finishing around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 blades.
The project of £1,35 billion is now expected to be ready by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the workplace today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry’s crossing.
We witness all really impressive engineering work in this project, which has used more than 30 000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge section.
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, finishing the bridge between the bridge and the bridge is a demanding operation where extreme precise dimensions need to be agreed.
Overall, almost 79% of the bridge is now in place and the last part of the deck of your concrete is lying in Rosyth today, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised to the bridge.
Michael Martin, Head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Builders project, said: “The first lock on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the height of construction technology.
When the last road cover was installed and connected to the expanding north pole, we then had to close the remaining proportion from the north, i.e. the inland-oriented side.
This was done by drawing 700 mm south of the northern road bridge.
This was a huge and very demanding measure at the same time.
Huge, because the terrain is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and was to be drawn to about 3% of the slope angle.
The required, because the allowed measuring deviations, according to which the team worked, were tiny, only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are happy while they're alive.
Three men are happy when they're alive, after they fell off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue ship was alerted at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event unfolding in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat continued to move on to themselves.
\"We saw the boat orbiting closer men and we imagined the worst,\" Moelfre's rescue boatman Vince Jones said.
Fortunately, the strong wind had blown it away from their creation by the time we started, he added.
The local fishing boat was saved from two men, and the third, 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging out of the boy's cabin without life jackets.
The men were taken to the coastal rescue ship and returned to the rescue ship.
Jones said: “These three men in the water are happy when they are alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had your dead end, but it had somehow removed the boat from the person of time when the boat fell.
Someone's taking care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been worried about the fact that teens and children no longer go out to play, but that they prefer to spend their free time watching the screens.
Pokémon Go makes people stand up on the couch and participate in some action.
The screen time was originally limited to television, then video games, and now to smartphones.
So it is great to see that technology and outdoor activity do not close each other out.
I refer, of course, to a wildness called Pokémon Go. The application based on characters that were originally developed in the 1990s in video games (later they were born in a cartoon series, game cards, and other sequels).
As with many pop-culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as a huge popularity overloaded servers.
Only in the days, Pokémon Go has more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
As explained in the nutshell, players use their smartphones in search of Pokémon, which is traced using GPS, and which can be photographed after the discovery (with the help of the phone's screen capture) or . . .
The generation that played the game younger has joined the wild and jumps up on the couch according to searches.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in daily steps – middle-lined.
Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which follows 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the release of the game 30 minutes per day, the number of people moving from 45 percent to 53 percent of the users on the cardiogram.
The company doesn’t know who plays Pokémon Gota, it only sees the training level data.
Many public health campaigns – finding 30 to 20, to rise on the couch – and to be active every day – have not yielded any results because most of the public health warnings are boring and are transmitted by people who seem unhappy.
However, the importance of the movement cannot be reduced.
Regularly, people are at a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps in weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes, its benefits are too diverse to be listed here.
The beauty of Pokémon Gon is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This will cover the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even get to hunt new friends.
As usual, the bad-ass fools are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk towards the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although previously there were applications such as Fitbit that could monitor activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The update will disappear and the use will be reduced in due course.
However, because of Pokémon’s success, there will be other games that combine applications and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, better condition and healthier.

Simone Biles caught gold in a multiplayer game of women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to it all.
Energic jumps.
It's going through the boom.
I can't believe it.
Great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American gymnastic reached a multi-playing championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the end of the world in the Olympics.
His total score, 62.198, was clearly better than the Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
In the US Simone Biles balance boom, women's standout multi-playing in the final of individuals in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The party became a fourth American woman, who has consistently won the championship, and all in all, the fifth American champion. At the same time, he strengthened his reputation as his generation, and perhaps as the best of all time.
He broke into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement raises the same class with other best athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
Biles has ruled his species for the last three years, winning 15 World Championship medals, including 10 gold, programs with a mix of ambition and precision so amazing that in 1984, Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him “the best to see him as a conqueror.”
The final test was expected in Brazil, a competition that wasn’t so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of excessive expectations.
Returning home to Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman, after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) women's toys in the finals of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is an August.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday, when he worked as a peak at the departure party of the retired national team coordinator Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought about the future as I long know to the top, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program - the one with his trademark's voltile threat - has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also be great for the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a taperon, and whose coach Aimee Boorman's mother found when she was on a study trip to the gym where Boorman was coached, became a force factor.
He hasn’t lost in a multi-player game since summer 2013, and this winning line will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small chair after two rounds, it was just a delusion.
The balance boom and the permant in which Biles is the dominant world champion, were expected.
He rose to the top at the booms of 15.433 and exceeded them by getting 15.933 perman.
Raisman used to hug him in goodwill when they were waiting for the final points - just the simplicity - and tears rose to the eyes of Biles with glitter red, white and blue, when the dream from which he once wrote his playbook came true.
Raisman’s performance was a kind of revolution four years ago when he was divided into a third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina in the renewal.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, which the Americans call \"grandfather\", was clearly in charge.
He sent planes to the public after his permansion in an emotional accident, which sometimes seemed to be questionable.
As far as Bilesis is concerned, this 19-year-old-old tweet from this week makes a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims of serial murder were shot when they listened to music in the car
Two women died in the most deadly attack of Phoenix's first-century serial killers, and a 12-year-old girl sat in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on 12 June.
The report states that the shooter on the passenger side of the car fired up to eight times and then fled on the other side of the vehicle.
According to the police, the death of three doesn't seem to have been the result of the robbery, because the attacker didn't take his handbags or another adult victim for $2900.
Officer of the Phoenix Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the shooting led scientists to see if it was connected to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two wounded in nine attacks in four months, mainly in Latin America.
“These occur in the residential area in front of the home,” Howard said earlier this month to the CBS subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as Nissan in the late 1990s, Black BMW in the late 1990s and White Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists have not agreed to disclose evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and that the same killer had done.
Ellis, 33, was in a hospital where he died later because of his injuries.
Liner, 31, and Elise's daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The witness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report about the shooting that happened only half an hour before the death of the three-hours, targeting a empty open-car, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Researchers found bullet seals, bullet seat and bullet fragments in the engine mode.
The mother of a 6-year-old with microcephalia: \"Your account will be easier.
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder from which his mother, Elizabeth Piciuto, did not know when he was pregnant.
“When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn’t do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
What's not true, I guess I made a promise, he said.
To him and his husband, Vincent, it was told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
“The first reaction was that “I didn’t know people were still doing it,” Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with his walks.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl like he was only three years old, and he's still not talking.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks with help and rides on a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sings.
Elizabeth will show me how Edmund's inventions suggest you sing a song for me.
\"We teach him a sign language,\" Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language, he says Edmund has invented some of his own links.
Microkephal may be due to a number of reasons: genetic, such as Edmund, or pregnancy-time viral infections such as ashes or Zika virus.
Symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those who have received the Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load caused by the uncertain future.
I was just wondering what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know.
In fact, I haven’t asked for a forecast in a while, because I don’t expect anyone to actually give me one.
But Picciutto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have birth defects due to Zika.
It'll make things easier.
You can believe that the situation will make it easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
The heavy rains and floods caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
In Louisiana, heavy rainfalls and widespread floods led the governor to declare the emergency state on Friday, waiting for more rain in the state on Saturday.
National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in south-eastern Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded over their thunderstorms and caused a large flood due to extreme hard rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that state authorities are constantly in contact with local authorities, and that aid is already coming to the needing districts.
Mike Steele, the Governor's Head of the Bureau for Security and Emergency Emergency Emergency, said they're getting requests for rising water transportation, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only the district of Tangipahoa asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flooder is valid until Saturday in a large part of the southern Louisiana.
In the opinion, the weather service said that three out of five cents of rain would be expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, the flooder was in force on Friday when the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River, which flows near Baton Rouge, and the Amite River, which flows near Denham Springs, are both located in Louisiana, and they were predicted to set a flooding record during the weekend.
The weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood into several houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is the flooding of the Ascension County, located below the river, when flooding rivers slowly fall to Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, was at the highest level of all time on Friday morning.
The rescuers were still picking up people from flood water in the districts of Amien and Wilkinson in the southwestern Mississip.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and half were close to Gloria on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that, normally, over 400 feet away from his house, the Beaver Creek water rose rapidly during the night.
He says that another boy who lives close to him warned him.
\"We woke up, and the water just continued to rise,\" Hansford said.
It stretched to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she had not seen the water of a bite so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family have injuries, and that he is the only swimmer.
Hansford said the rescue workers saved three of them in a large, army-style truck and took them to the Gluster fire station, where the saved nights spent on Friday.
Krautmann says that floods are rapidly spread to a large extent as heavy rainfall continues, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that a witness near Livingston reports 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country had been completely tired of the heavy rain since the middle of the week.
The flooding of heavy rains and streets led to the rescue of the inhabitants of Tangipahoma County from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, the authorities said.
CBS’s subsidiary WWL reports that a member of the City Council in Tangipahoa said 200 homes were under a flood.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, but both are now under fire.
President of the district, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets who had remained islands of rising water.
There are shelters in the cities of Amien and Hammond for those who have been evacuated.
\"They'll be allowed to return to their homes when the water starts to fall,\" he said.
In the city of Hammond, in the district of Tangihaho, twenty streets were closed due to rising water, and the inhabitants were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
“The last large flood was here in March,” said Lacy Landrum, the city’s administration.
This is going to be a similar case.
In Missyssip, the Emergency Director of Harrison County, Rupert Lacy, said a flat rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday, a handful of houses were reported to have flooded, but so far, no floods have been reported.
The director of the Shopper Value Foods movement in Amitessa, Keith Townson, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and the rain continues.
“To be full of bullets – had a six-year-old Maha Brown survives Philadelphia’s shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means shooting another six-year-old in the city this week.
His grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaha Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown had a number of shooting wounds in the joints, legs, arms and stomach, but he was unconscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
“He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets, the boy’s grandmother Delores Melenez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the condition of the boy has been declared critical, and he has been subjected to several cuts.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting his first class at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four shootings in the Germantown Quarter.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men were reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car together with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
Scientists tell CBS Philadelphia that it seems that there were cross between several shooters.
The types of insecticides, which originate from different assault weapons, filled the place of the event.
It seems that this was definitely a constant battle.
There were mosquitoes on both sides of the sidewalk.
\"So it seems that there were several armed fighters here and that they were in an active battle,\" the Philadelphia police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and according to the information received, the police are investigating surveillance camera footage.
Another six-year-old girl, a girl, was deceived by her hand on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s why I call this year’s women’s Olympic team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, this team includes three gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren-Laurie- Hernandez, who have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everything proud.
This team looks, finally, from America.
It has also established itself at the top of the dark and Latin American women's co-existence.
The most successful female teamer for the past four years has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were the first and the second.
This is great.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas surprised me as an Olympic champion, and America was cheering.
Now the world has been able to prove the amazing performances of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, where they present unexpected but masterful gymnastic programs.
On Thursday, Simon became a fourth American woman, who has consistently won an individual gold in a multiplayer game of women.
And the teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation does not look like this in gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie went all the same path as Aly and Madison reached the Olympic team.
They are “Final Five” (the last five) because the next Olympic gymnastic team will have only four gymnastics, and this is Marta Karoly’s last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is an expensive species, and gymnastics are mainly practiced in private gymnastics, maintained by parents who pay for training, facilities, travels, uniforms, competitive fees, hotel charges (trainers and their gymnastics and families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the species.
At these clubs, gymnastics get all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnastics.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and coach Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they began their gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and accessible gymnastic training to communities where many young girls, inspired by Simon, Gabby and Laurie, live.
I founded my gymnastic foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics to over 15,000 urban young people (mainly black and Latin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (in my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this significant type of Olympics.
Forcers develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the generosity, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, school and work success.
This team's inspiration will make thousands of young girls start to exercise, and it's great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We're having an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison for showing you seriously take-out-the-girl power - by winning the Olympic team ball, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road towards a healthy, strong and successful young womanhood.
Doctors are organising new strikes after Jeremy Hunt's proposal has been rejected.
Ministers had hoped to stop the change to the dispute by agreeing to the improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff, but 58% of the 37,000 doctors who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the agreement, saying that NHS was on an unknown soil, and that even small additional delays would damage staff and patients.
The first medical practitioners will be transferred to a new agreement containing changes to night and weekend work patterns to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee of Doctors, said last night: “The medical practitioners are still seriously concerned about the proposed agreement, in particular by the acceleration of the existing labour crisis, and that it does not treat all doctors in a balanced manner.
When only eight weeks are left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress has to be made and time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced the government's unwillingness to participate and sometimes deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
\"Jeremy Hunt must now act, remove the punishment and take into account the concerns of doctors.
If he does not do so, doctors are ready to continue their work-fighting activities.
The last strike at the end of April meant a delay of almost 13,000 routine surgery and 100,000 reception hours, when nurses and consultants were recruited to act as a substitute for doctors in the strike guard.
Ministers had hoped to stop the changes to the dispute by agreeing to the improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff.
BMA wants a better weekend wage with 54,000 medical practitioners under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to medical practitioners so they wouldn’t go to the strike.
Mortimer said: “A very little or nothing is achieved in the struggles, but they put pressure on the teams and services already in a demanding situation, as well as causing concern, anxiety and disruption to patients, carers and their families.
During the last two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of control (Guardian Role) and revelations (Whistleblowing).
Employers were hopeful to have a continuous positive debate on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training from the Sabbath, the cost of education, mutual recognition of the curriculum, the freedom of study and gender pay gap in medicine - is a sign of how seriously the employers, the Health Education England training organisation and the Ministry of Health and Health, respect for the agreements with BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds a day-paying medicine can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients benefit from two pounds of a daily paid drug after the authorities recommended that it be given to people longer.
A medicine that prevents blood clotting, ticagrelor, drops the risk of renewable seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or another stroke.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Approximately 140,000 people get a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of them get a second attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are due to the fatty tissue that is collected in the artery wall, which forms an athum.
If the sinus cracks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the blood circulation from causing a heart attack.
If the clot is removed, it can go with the blood and cut the blood circulation into the brain, causing stroke.
People who have already had one attack have increased the risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, produced by a British company AstraZeneca, and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the hyping less likely.
In today’s draft NICE guidelines, it is recommended that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, head of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “In spite of the availability of effective advanced treatments, even a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will later receive another heart attack or stroke, whose consequences are often devastating.
The fear of renewal can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the person.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we initially recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to add available treatment options to many thousands of people who may benefit from them.
Since data on the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor - in particular as regards the risk of bleeding - are limited over three years, the draft guidance plan does not recommend treatment longer than during this period.
The culture of political correctness allows the flowering of the electoral crop in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year because of corruption, giving a boost to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the fact that widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities has been overlooked, the report of the shocking government today is revealed.
The former government minister, Sir Eric Pickles, set up police, election guards and city councils to ignore the evidence of electoral violence and religious hypersensitivity.
The former Community Secretary, the current anti-corruption emperor, said that the fear of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to set up security chains for the protection of scared voters outside the polls.
He recommends that voters should present an ID card when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter only needs to say his or her name and address.
The report even proposes that the finger of the voting person be put in an unlosed ink so that no one can vote twice.
You should better protect the hypocrites, sir Eric says.
He calls on the press to gain greater access to the documents and decisions of the delegation that the informal committees or the working group have taken.
“This would not only protect from the elections, but would protect the local government from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud, which goes hand in hand with the election, he said.
The government ordered a report as a result of the voting scandal of East London Tower Hamlets.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of a number of charges for corruption and illegal actions.
The Court found that Rahman’s cynically distorted the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islam.
Rahman is said to have led his election campaign on the basis of the religious obligation of loyal Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were predictable or the result of a person voting in another.
Sir Eric said that the evidence of the wool can be found throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern at the vote of the election congregation, where members of the high-ranking Muslim community were said to pressure people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the proof of identity with the ID card.
He said: “The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the older people’s will, especially in communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
“It was a concern that the state institutions had ignored such behavior because of the ‘politically correct’ race and the hypersensitivity to religion.
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, which included the prohibition of political activists being able to process the ballot tickets received by the post so that the votes would end.
The report that Theresa May looks at also calls for more stringent amendments to be made to the data subjects in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Take a look at the options to prove the identity of voters before voting.
Use the finger of the person voting for the lost ink so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationalisation checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit on requests for an automatic vote via mail.
Prevent political activists from handling the sound and envelopes that have been received through the mail in which the voices are sent.
Let the police set the chain of security around the polls.
Change the law to make it easier to accuse people of being afraid by the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography at polls illegal.
Request that only English be used in voting places (except in Wales).
Reinforce training to ensure that staff adhere to the rule that the voter must go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric blows up the police forces in North London saying it's \"unfortunate,\" not after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The election court will remain as a result of the numerous corruption and illegal actions of Lutfur Rahman and his officials,” he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds without doubt, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticized the ineffective-iron checks - in the city councils' voting registers.
Sir Eric said: “The last year’s Tower Hamlets judgment was a wake-up.
Our nation has a glorious heritage as the birth of Parliaments, but this worrying and mysterious spread of the electoral crop and the ban on certain groups of facts is threatening this good reputation.
Crazy Kate's biking doubles and other famous images of Rio Olympics
This week, fans of Rio’s 2016 Olympics have gone nuts with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, a proven duke of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic representative is not the only gold-fighting athlete this summer, who can boast with his famous double being - at least according to social media.
So in honor of Rio's races and all the famous faces on our squares right now, FEMAIL has made up a list of Olympic athletes that look clearly like Hollywood's celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: U.S. men's archery team member Brady Ellisonia, on the left, is compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since she was a child
In addition to Kate's dual being found on the pyörödäjädárda, many people online have been quick to note how a certain archer could be the twin of Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. Men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter since he rose to the surface of his images, where he seems to be afraid of the same as the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, when he became aware of the excitement of social media, the archer admitted that he had heard from Leo since childhood.
“I don’t see a great deal of consistency except for the beard,” Brady told Huffington Post.
He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment.
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will also emerge this year: a dazzling consistency between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnastic Alya Mustafina’s biggest, apparent eyes have been said to be a Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan’s dual being.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghi has been comparing Glee to Matthew Morrison for many years.
Larger shift to the eye: This user believes Nathan is an Inception actor – a sports version –
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis player Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of which have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Yulia Efimova, a Russian hoppadistist, has more than the same actor Annalynne McCord as a browned skin and light hair, while the US team Nathan Adrian, according to the fans, reminds us of the sports version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.
Hard Women: Football Star Hope Solo, Left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, Right, Share the same face shape and eyes
Not the only one: a Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a couple of similarities
A Twitter user has recently expressed his happiness on the site that “other online think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
And the American football star and the Dexter actress really have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical with the smile of actress Laura Linney, and the gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful, wide smile matches the Bring It On star Gabrielle Union's smile.
The CBC Olympic Commissioner apologizes to the Chinese swimmer’s death as a pig.
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s fourth message of women’s 4x200 metres of free swimming rage raged the viewers of the CBC’s direct Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC had to apologize since one of its browsers said during the race the 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer was like a bad smell and died like a pig.
The filmer Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions with women 4x200 metres of free swimming in the message-final.
MacDonaldi, who came to CBC's browser team to bring color, said: \"That little 14-year-old from China, your baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Ai Yanhan, a Chinese swimmer at the second part of the message at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than the Taylor Ruck in Canada, which allowed Canada to catch China.
The viewers from all over Canada react quickly to the language used and its tone on the internet, as they were shocked by the language used.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Does CBC’s browser just say that China’s 14-year-old swimmer “death like a pig”??
The idiot didn't realize he was still in direct delivery.
Chinese Ai Yanhan was described as follows: \"That little 14-year-old from China, the baby--
A review of Byron MacDonald on Twitter was tough and fast, while many were challenging him.
Twitter users didn’t arrest themselves when they heard how invaluable Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: “Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist group.
Soon thereafter, Scott Russell, who was plotting a CBC broadcast, asked for an apology to MacDonald’s comment in a direct shipment, saying: “We want to know that the comment on swimming was sent.
It was a unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that this happened.
CBC decided to apologize more than 90 times for people who had tweeted the answer to the comment.
Scott Russell had to apologize for MacDonald.
After that, CBC copied and linked an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The Tv company also quickly apologized and published an opinion.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent directly.
Last night, we quickly took action and apologized to our viewers and our followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
However, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in a direct shipment and tried to define his remarks by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
“I would like to apologize at this moment for the comment I made last night after the women’s message,” he said at the CBC Olympics.
“I talked about the performance of the swimmer, not him as a person.”
“It’s not necessary to say that I didn’t mean it to be disrespectful, and that I’m really sorry.”
Primark’s client was stricken with a woman who quickly matched underwear in the middle of the trade
Customers didn’t know what to look at when a woman took off in the middle of Primark’s movement to try underwear.
Things did not improve, after assessing what he looked like in his pants, the woman peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour, and eventually agreed on four underwear in a shop located at Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone.
Primark's movement at Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone, where the woman adapted her underwear and then put them back in the shelf
At the same time, the mother of two children who had been in the store, Jenny Davidson, said that after testing her underwear, a mysterious woman dressed again and walked away from the shop without buying anything.
He said, \"People didn't believe their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took the panties that were presented by the couple, stripped her own stockings and underwear, and put her tone for her feet.
He did not even try to find a remote place for reconciliation, but he stood in it shameless.
“Everyone was staring at him when he took off his underwear again and obviously didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did the same for three couples before he finally decided he didn’t like anything he saw, dressed again and walked out.
He didn't seem to care who looked at the person who would end up buying the underwear he agreed to.
Davidson, a 33-year-old in Kent, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone takes their underwear home, which someone else has tried, but has not been cleaned.
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I was told that the staff apparently tried to remove clothing from the sale after the woman left, which is very good.
“It would be awful to go home with new panties and find that the other woman has put them on and stripped them off, and they have not been washed.
Primark’s representative said: “Primark is aware of the incident that took place in Folkestone’s movement on Tuesday 9 August.
All of the products concerned have been withdrawn from the sale.
This way you can defend yourself from armed attacks by using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Krav Maga Federation's major Rhon Mizrach in New York to find out how to deal with gunfighting robbers at a close distance.
The video shows how you can pay the attacker on the same scale.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached behind, the first must turn to see your attacker and arrows on the line of fire.
After that, you'll catch the gun between the elbow and the shoulder before you hit the attacker on your face with a free elbow.
Continue to hit the knee on the neck, and when the attacker goes to the pain of the plaster, turn the gun from his hand, hit him with the gun on his face, and hold the gun against him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technology is similar: remove your body from the fireline, grab the gun and turn it around so that the offender cannot fire.
Put pressure on the gun at the same time and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun on his head, back off, and point him out with a gun.
Does it sound difficult?
Watch the video exactly how Mizrach does this.
But remember, if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way to get rid of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright is licking the dirtiest places in Europe for travel guide
The British traveler has put a serious challenge on his immune system and vomiting reflexes by licking some of the dirtiest and most night-time places in Europe.
Suffolk’s co-founder and traveling author Ian Wright, 51, licking euro banknotes, envy in Piccadilly Circus, a train’s bathroom squeaking device and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of its immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a photometer to show himself and to us the situation he was going to take.
The experiment, which was made with a film called the inner strength, however, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking a train of thousands of people can seem completely hostile, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout Europe, Wright was constantly talking to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his arrows left him in the mouth of a bad taste.
Wright became a known tester of the endurance of his intestines when he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task, which extends to the Wc seat's squealing system, really tested his immune system.
In a film he said: “Since childhood, I have been quite concerned about my health, and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth from the soil, the worms, and the fucking water.
He really confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
He showed more than 4,000 units in the photometer.
Because of comparison, the reading of the hands of the respondents should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public village, he refused to lick when the result of the photometer looked more than 4,000 units, and the result of the hands of the opponents was less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler’s film, along with a Finnish mechanic, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the film, the wedding said: “This is almost the worst thing I have ever seen in the toilet.
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's a nighttime.
Following the inner strength was produced together with Finnish meijer, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and vitamin D, which help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, head of the snacks, juice and new categories, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and at the same time explain the interests of the probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and ended up with the idea of \"let's go to Ian.\"
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: tell us about the good and bad bacteria of our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary allows us to tell more about it in an interesting way.
I think the document also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The documentary director Tom Hakala added: “Let’s say this, if Ian had been licked by some of the things I asked him to do, as I would have lost my respect for him, as a Russian guest in the film.
Clearly, some of the licking things were easier for Ian, while some were quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows.
In the 2015 survey, 84% of respondents specifically linked lactic bacteria to the well-being of the stomach and intestine, and 58% said that they used at least between products with added lactic bacteria.
The family destroyed the rental house in Cornwall Saltashi before the wedding
The Electrical Family caused $50,000 damage to their rental house after they were married due to the terroristisation of their neighbors.
Tanya Keldo and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Cornwall Saltashi since they had been complained many times.
When they had been removed from the property by force, the shocked housing company’s employees said the property was in poor condition.
The walls were made of aggravating holes, the floor boards were torn, the waste was spread to the floor, and the walls were damaged with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the owner of Cornwall Houston, said he was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said: “This has been a nightmare for the inhabitants, and I don’t think people should have to live this way.
Here are a lot of points to consider, because this property is probably known through the less comfortable groups of Cornwall.
This family is poor, and their name is bad.
There were three boys who lived in the property, and according to the police, the family’s fear of a street fight in baseball, the fear of loved ones, the use of drugs, the sale of drugs, and the cry, controversy and curse.
The 47-year-old Skellodon, whose name was in the lease agreement, received a decision in June on non-social behaviour.
Many of the rooms in the house below the grave were found with old waste.
The property, from which the earlier drug was transmitted, had been pulled up.
Neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing was forced into force by the means of a woman and her partner's property this week after giving them a longer period of time, 11 weeks, time to change voluntarily.
The vulnerable neighbors thanked the wedding saying that their lives had become one hell of a hell.
One said, “They didn’t care about anyone.
We lived as their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here a lot of times.
This morning, we didn't get a dream.
We got up because it was so quiet, we're not used to it!
It's lovely now that they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Houston neighborhood, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property.
The garbage and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the rental house.
He added: “It is a pity that the resident took no responsibility for his or her own and his family’s behavior, for the extermination is always the last procedure considered by Cornwall Houston.
This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been detested by neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall, as well as by the brave, informed community members.
I hope that this development will bring something to comfort the neighbors and send a message that anti-social use will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in the twenty.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom after the vote
Housing company employees now need to clean the waste floors around the house
In 2014, the police made a raid on the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis as well as foam, supplies, as well as 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon received fines after admitting his guilt to the possession of a B-grade drug as a plan to divide it forward.
He claimed that money was meant for his son Lee Skeldon's gravestone, which died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner live homeless now in private accommodation in Plymouth.
For many of the house's walls, graffiti was damaged.
Police say they are trying to exterminate the residents who have to mock the rules of their rental contract.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police said the wedding was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to mock the rules.
“This is a message for those who think that their conduct is without penalties, and for those who suffer from such behavior,” he said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social use. Police will continue working with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when the military jet flew to the beach to jump low
The sun worshipers in the Avero of Portugal experienced the shock of their lives.
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion
Air Forces said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
Just now, the terrified tourists began to panic when a low-flyed jet was sweeping over the beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft almost reached the touch distance from the solar servants on the sandy track in the North Portugal Avero.
Holidayers stood up when they started to understandably worried about the noise from the jet machine, even though they didn’t begin to see what was coming towards them behind the clouds.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro last afternoon.
One of the many vacationers who published videos of a dramatic bypass in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: “It passed twice very low, and one thing seemed to be going down the ground.
Nuno Arroja added: “I was surfing, and it really felt like the machine was falling on me.
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared in the dark and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Forces said today that the P-3C Orion aircraft pilot was on a training flight designed to identify fishing boats close to the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet was flying significantly lower than usual due to the bad visibility caused by the smoke of nearby terrains, but the air forces assured that no one was in danger.
The fires have destroyed some of the continental Portugal this summer, and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Forces said today that the pilot had to fly in low visibility due to the adverse conditions, the smoke caused by the terrains and the thick fog.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
Exote's first half result better than expected
The Southern Karelia Social and Health District (Exote) made a better result of EUR 3.4 million in June.
The result of the Exote was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to eradicate institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
Exote aims to reduce the number of measures this year.
Exotic covers the surplus of the previously generated deficit.
The proportion that remains above it may be used to reduce queues and buy measures for patients.
The annual result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exote Government will discuss the mid-term review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special limiters swore in Immola
Of the 70 vice presidents of the Border and Marine Guard School, they swore a military light on Friday.
The military lighting of the Border and Marine Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10 special border icebreaking courses were held at the reserve sports field.
The soldier swore 70 backup men.
Special limiters are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were applied for as a special limiter.
Some of them were called 250.
Special limiters have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the border forces of the war were involved in the occasion of the valuing.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans involved in the event were born in 1918.
A limited crime ahead - criminal intelligence helps to investigate crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland's 11 police agencies has been operating an RTA-i.e. criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible.
There are four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is drawn by Lahti's ranked superior.
The Chief Executive is working in Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian person dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everybody works in a civilian outfit.
The unit has demonstrated its suitability and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides other police officers with different reports.
In trouble, it has, among other things, obtained information about asylum seekers.
The latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim is to prevent crimes, i.e. to let the police go more and less, until they get the alarm.
The information collected and analyzed by the unit will target daily police activities where it is most needed.
A criminal intelligence centre, less than three national units, and each police department’s own criminal intelligence unit were established in the country along with the reform of police.
The PTR Centre in Vantaa’s Central Crime Police shall conduct its operations nationally.
PTR units work according to their name from police, Customs, and Border Guard.
The RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas distributed according to police facilities, and are responsible for providing information to both local police and national units.
The survey extends beyond its territory.
Where a single police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on throughout the police station.
The survey also extends beyond the limits of its own institution, because it is also a crime.
People working in RTA units have better basic police skills.
The unit strives to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals, or similar crimes through the use of registry, alert mission databases and observations.
This is called serialisation, and it is one of the most important criminal intelligence tools.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it was honest or criminal.
On the basis of an action, the author forms a certain kind of image.
It may be done on the basis of an act or person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals Learn About Their Mistakes
The workers of the RTA unit are not able to carry the collars in the city, but their work is not entirely public.
Both their own and the methods used by criminals are not reported because it could lead to professional offenders developing their activities and thus trying to prevent police anti-criminal companies.
The police will publicly tell us if they are expected to pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, news of the early summer, the way in which empty apartments were used in housing fractures.
In it, the authors put the apartment in the outer door of the stick, a double needle, or a tape of tape where they tested whether the residents were really traveling.
The preliminary examination material shall be made public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The smartest ones are ordering a district court protocol, which may, for example, indicate that fingerprints have been found on the site.
Next time, we're going to go to the cops' hands.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppa of Hämee Police, Lieutenant General Tuimo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Department, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Inspector, Mr. Marco Tumela from the Central Crime Police.
The police will collect and analyze information that will help to plan practical action.
Based on a reduction in labour and financial volumes.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last change was a three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of your institution and Finland.
Schoolgirl from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British school girls who left London last year to join the Isis, has died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that the girl's family heard this dead Syrian Raqqa a few weeks ago.
On Thursday, ITV News announced that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the base of the organization in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to his family, died just when he was planning to flee the war from the country and return to Britain.
“You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a grave stone and a testament to others that leaving the war zone involves real risks – that it could make people give up for making such a decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015 Sultana and two other Austrian school girls flew to Turkey, where they went by bus to the border of Syria.
Sultana's family was told that she had married an Isis fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow just after a few months.
Reid says Clinton is a candidate for Garland's Supreme Court if he is elected
Senator Harry Reid says he is convinced that President-elect Hillary Clinton appoints Judge Merrick Garland as the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
The Senate Republicans have prevented Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Mitch McConnell, head of the Senate majority, says that the next president will choose a person to replace the late Supreme Court member Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday in a phone conference that he would predict with some assurance that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He congratulated Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to stop the boat with a new choice.
Garland is the head of the U.S. Court of Justice District of Columbia.
Reid said that Republicans that block Garland's name are Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump's policymakers and subscribers.
He said Trump wasn't fit for the job.
Treads says that the lower calendar is for women as well as for men.
The Treasures magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pirell in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of nude celebrities, they are going to find their next top generation 2017 NU Muses calendar.
The president of Treats, Steve Shaw, told us earlier this year that his high-ranking journal differs from the Playboy in the old school because \"Playboy is for men\".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them.
“We must begin to show a timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired with these pictures of the naked women’s body,” Shaw said in a press release where the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can leave pictures via the network or personally in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl Destination: Who Really Buys Records?
Private, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you rush into fulfilling the commentation with an irritable offense, the author of which is the name NoAllExcellentKeski-aged Man, notice that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the new arrival of a large number of recorded records is not because more and more people born this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but about the age of the Middle Ages.
Apparently, those who have bought a vinyl plate in the near future are most likely 45-54 years old.
In fact, the most unlikely records are purchased by the age group of 18-24-year-olds.
The question is also not only about the collection of amateurs, but also about the sense that older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their emotions (56% vs 53%) and enjoy their loneliness (69%).
But do YouGov's results keep it true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me when I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, I would be wearing a modest gray suit. I would quickly point out before I stop, I would form a cup of my hands and say something of dignity, like, \"Let's look at the matter more closely.\"
Let's take a closer look at this.
At the same time, when Soho's charm and dirt are slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops, as well as office supplies now meet the buildings where there were previously independent movements - the handful of wonderful specialized record stores still remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment when I stand very close to different men in some of these shops trying to evaluate their age and emotional temperament.
Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) at Reckles Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in twenty), spends his afternoon in London due to a meeting, and spins shops to spend a few hours.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
\"I am,\" he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, which appear in the picture above (i.e. sending a sample by e-mail, did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge amount of disk and singles is partly the result of his income available to him: now he can buy records that he could not afford when they were originally published, and he can buy again those that he sold when he was young and moneyless.
“Most of the materials I purchased are late in the 60s and early 70s, records that were published when there were 11 or 12 records that I was a little too young to get,” he said.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: “I don’t smoke or drink much.
This is my evil...
25-year-old Wez, who works in Sister Ray, also believes that many of his customers will fit YouGov's profile.
However, he has noticed the new wave of people who have been influenced by media enthusiasm. People who have heard that the records have come back to fashion and who have become the need to buy their old albums back.
Based on my discussions, people have usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy cds now sell their cds to buy their records back, he says.
This may explain an increase in the number of vinyl evaporates of a particular age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the discs?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community for similar types.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly injured by the payment system.
Some vinyl fans can be hacked from the digital world and choose to be trusted for the durability of familiar discs; objects that awaken memories of teenage days of happiness.
“I think sometimes it may be about filling the hole or some kind of consolation that the ownership of objects creates,” Wez says.
As a collector, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It is an easy way to fulfill your thoughts.
\"We're like their social workers,\" the other employee suddenly said from a record pile.
The April ICM opinion poll revealed that almost 50% of people who had purchased vinyl plate in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those buying vinyl do not have a record player.
This is where the news report is likely to appear to be a serious concern in my browser to the stack of the bos nova collections.
This “resurrection” aspect is something that Jonny, who also works in the Sounds of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men), has noticed.
“Sometimes ago, someone came in and said, “I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on a shelf,” he says.
It's not a big deal, but it's definitely happening.
More products, less music.
We have people who say, \"I don't have a record player.
So not the parents, but the younger people, the late years who are just excited about it.
In a photo where today there is almost a whole floor reserved for vinyls, there is a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventy-sixths of parcs, tourists taking photos, teens, and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the earlier movements - the echoing to strip Wild Beast's newest sinful and sex-like pop, and not improvisation jazz - it's great to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to prove a pale psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes watching the various records in the sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so it's not really an option.
It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is... she's making love.
“I don’t know how to explain – it’s really unique.
My last stop is said to have awakened the generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
At the same time I try to look like I'm looking at the cockroaches, I observed a group of teenage girls who gather around the Polaroid cameras for a moment before my father and daughter think about buying Crosley's record player.
On the left, there is a portal with a wall covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, any of the basic records of the average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorative, and some are so high that they are impossible to touch.
It's purely artistic.
But given that even the small attention given to these objects can mean more money for industry and send a few customers to Soho to eat more, there is not much to complain about.
It is not surprising that the population with more likely time and money is also the one who uses the most luxurious ones, such as vinyls.
But even though my findings suggest that youGov’s results are accurate at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard in school or office.
They don’t really spend their Thursday mornings painting around Berwick Street’s record stores, browsing discs and avoiding a rough, 30-year-old artificial TV driver looking at this throat over the middle-aged men’s shoulders.
Holkeri is the most distant living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say that the holocaust has a longer life span than any other planet's spine.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the disease, says that the record is on a female, whose age is thought to be between 272 and 512 years, and which is five meters long.
The French court rejects the application to terminate trades in the Jungle refugee camps
The French court has rejected the application of the Calais authorities to expel dozens of temporary shops and restaurants from the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court proceedings this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to eliminate all 72 temporary trades in which people in the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, provide hair surgery or sell tea at 50 cents (40 cents), or sell simple food in a few euros of farm restaurants.
The Calais Prefect Office argued that the places should be demolished because they represent taxes on a non-payable parallel economy and because they are a risk of fire and cleaning.
The humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that the free meals provided by the state-backed organization and other groups do not provide enough food to the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary stores and restaurants often provide protection and free meals for those who need them.
In Lille, the court ordered that there were no legitimate grounds for the extermination of 72 people who were engaged in temporary trade, but said that the prefect of Calais was completely understandable.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than just eating people living in extreme uncertain conditions.
He said that the facilities offered peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the sail guard was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, whose activity is unprofitable, offering 200 meals daily, English and French lessons, as well as asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors.
Over 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect children's cafes.
The letter sent to Guardian said that closing the cafe would be a disaster for these children, some of which are only eight years old.
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimate on Friday that the number of people at the Jungle camp has risen to 9000 people - the top reading - after the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices in Finland are clearly lower than on average in the EU
In Finland, food is very cheap for consumers and for producers.
The price of food in Finland has decreased by almost five per cent in three years, while the average price of food in EU countries decreased by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one percent more expensive.
Over the last three years, food prices have fallen to the second most in Finland from the EU countries with a similar level of wages than in Finland.
Only in the UK, the price of food has decreased faster than in Finland.
The information is reflected in Ilkka Lehtiinen, the Director of Development of Statistics Finland, which was published in the Information & Trends blog.
The paper compared real prices, i.e. prices related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose strongly.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price of what came with the EU membership,” Lehtinen said.
Then followed the translation, after which the food has become cheaper every year.
Now, the price is heavy on the import bans imposed by Russia, which have forced food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of dairy and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and the agricultural producer prices have fallen.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
The tightened price competition in industry and trade has also affected the fall in price.
The large trade chains of the S-Group and Kesko have both dropped their prices.
The price competition for consumers has been shown to be visible as promotional campaigns.
Finland still does not have low levels of food, although the price of food has decreased significantly.
In 2015, food in Finland was the fourth most expensive of the EU countries with a level of wages similar to that in Finland.
According to the journal, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the analogue countries had the same VAT rate, the most cheap food would be sold in Finland from countries similar to the same level of wages.
The paper compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands.
If VAT rates were seven in the analogue countries, only German and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
\"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries at the price of food, VAT must be halved to the average level of EU countries and continue to compete,\" Lehtinen wrote.
The letter notes that the calculation made by him by the rate of VAT is indicative.
School is no longer the same.
A return to school may show that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide to all Finnish schools.
The schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of beauty is abandoned, and instead, schools begin to practice the codem.
Sweden’s education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and social learning begins in the fourth quarter.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of students.
It was thought that the teacher teaches the students, but now everyone needs to be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest vertebrate found - ice sharks can live for up to 400 years
The ice cream known as Greenlandn shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches maturity only at the age of 150.
It can then live for another 250 years, report a new study.
The figures make the species the longest vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal, it will only be passed by an infant in Iceland, whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507.
Greenland is swimming along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females stretch dogs longer, they can grow up to five meters.
Because the rate of growth is slow, according to follow-up, only about a centimetre per year, adult individuals have been living hard for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He defined the age of 28 of the adult ice sharks, which had remained in the fishing gear of fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed from the radiocarbonation of the eyelids.
The mean age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fishes in the sample, 493- and 502-cented amasonics, revealed about 335 and 392-year-olds.
Since previous studies have shown that ice creams only reach sexual maturity at more than four meters, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years of age at that point.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann is fired for almost 300 - no vendors are reduced
Nearly 300 employees are fired from Stockman.
The company in difficulty ended in the beginning of August.
“As a result of the negotiations, around 300 jobs are reduced, the main part of which is carried out as dismissals, Stockmann says.
The number of vendors in the goods sector is not reduced so that the customer service does not suffer.
In addition, around 80 employees of support activities will be offered a new job as a seller.
Stockmann's yr negotiations concerned around 3,000 employees.
They were estimated to be around 380 employees at the start of their reduction.
The reduction of the population aims at annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are expected to be achieved in the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve the savings of €50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties are to make the store profitable.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the trade in goods still loses.
Stockmann’s CEO, Lauri Veijalainen, said sales in department stores have not reached the company’s goals.
Unfortunately, the reduction of the population is necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail’s positive operating result in 2018-2018, Veijalainen says in the statement.
The result improvement of the second quarter was particularly due to Lindex’s good success in the clothing chain.
Ketju achieved the best in the second quarter of all time’s turnover and result.
Lindex's operating profit grew by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s operating profit was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales of this year will decrease last year.
It is expected that the correct operating result will be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature less than 20 degrees in the whole country
The low pressure centre in the north of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, a meteorologist from HS.
There will also be rainfalls in the middle of the country, but the southwest is from the north.
The temperature is no longer very summer, for the whole country is less than 20 degrees of mercury.
The northern rainy areas remain at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya’s general sports team shakes doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach’s pace
John Anzrah, a Kenyan general sports coach, was sent home from Rio Olympics after it appeared that Anzrah appeared as a national athlete in Dopingtest.
The news agency AP said that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is a 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenyan National Team, reported that Anzrah’s identity was revealed after he had given a sample of Rotichina in a surprise test.
Doping officials were reporting to the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he committed a crime against the Kenyan national team.
He appeared as an athlete, gave urine samples and even signed documents.
We cannot accept such use, in turn, by Kip Keino, chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, the news agency Reuters.
The Olympics’ overall sport begins on Friday, and Rotich is expected to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was ranked in the World Championships last year for the fourth and has pre-winning Rio winner recommendations.
According to Reuters, the source inside the Kenyan general sports team claimed that Anzrah only went to the athlete’s accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When the anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was a athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid of being exposed, the source told me.
Where's everybody?
Rio General Sports Stadium
Where is everybody?
At the Rio Olympic Stadium, they don’t follow a public sport.
On Friday, the fight began in Rio, but the world’s top teams were able to present their skills to a confusing, empty audience.
On Friday, Rio said that only 58 percent of the first day’s morning tickets and 65 percent of the night’s tickets were sold.
It was four years ago in London, where the stadium had been bullied by a cheering force.
The final tickets are already sold in Rio.
The Rio Olympics’ audience has attracted attention before the public sport.
For example, in the views of rugby, melody and horse riding, thousands of empty trucks have been seen.
When Brazil's medals Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacaban, only 70% of the audience was full.
After Brazil, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the 12,000 people looked at it.
The bad goings at least explain that Brazil, struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian competitions, and many of the Olympics are weird for the Brazilians who are accustomed to football.
Even the first game of the Brazilian football team was not allowed to pull the football stadium full.
In the weekend Mario Andrada announced that 82% of tickets had been sold, which is clearly less than four years ago.
“We still have 1.1 million left to sell,” said Reuters.
Of the 8,5 million London Olympics tickets, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost nearly half more than Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not yet allowed, because organisers need money and try to get tickets for sale until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organisers have given 240 000 tickets to less-known species such as golf and rugby to school children.
At Rio Stadium, empty places were enough in the morning.
Even the beach volleyball Copacaba's sand has not been interested in the audience.
Jukka Central Hall competed in London in 2012.
The people on the leaves were enough.
New way to protect nature - Get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in the conservation of nature by the latest means.
The Foundation established last year acquires its ownership of ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private, companies and entities may, by means of money, redeem ownership rights to the land.
The foundation has acquired its first land area from Lapland.
The land area is divided virtually into blocks that the willing ones can obtain against the payment of the right of ownership.
The holder receives a veto right of 187 square blocks, which means in practice that no approval of each holder is required if the use of the land area is intended to be changed.
You can also obtain the right to hold a number of blocks.
The acquisition of the right of administration is something concrete that can be left to your inheritance or give as a gift.
You don't have to go to carry the banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature, and Juha Levviakangas, who acquired his right to control.
The right-holder receives accurate location information in his or her area, allowing for example in the area of the visit.
On the website of the Foundation, the names of the holders of the rights of ownership are shown on the same map, where the data on the land area are found.
Levikagas sees the risk of its natural protection supply only that the Foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would operate in some way in an ethical or commercial way, but should not be possible.
The foundation of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is the protection of nature areas so that they can be intact and in peace.
The foundation acquires land areas either by purchasing or offering donations.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the foundation has acquired its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also targets outside the Finnish borders and plans to be imported from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Wheel thieves torture the big cities, worst of all Turkey - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves are the worst in Turkey from large cities in Finland.
This year, there are more bikes stolen in proportion to the number of inhabitants than in nine other major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat reported to the police on the basis of bicycle theft, the extent to which the ten largest cities have stolen bicycles in January-August this year and their parts per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose.
According to police records, four to five bike thefts per thousand inhabitants took place.
In Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bike thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
“In other cities, double theft is carried out in proportion to the number of residents, compared to others, according to police officer Tommi Reen.
Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more spins have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have a response to that.
“The generality of the maps can be influenced by how much the city is moving on wheels and how much the wheels are at all, thinking over-consistant Teemu Kähäs.
Tommi Reen, the police government, looks forward to having Turku, Helsinki and Oulu rise at the top of the comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to what are study and cycling cities.
Turku has a tight center, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a very different type of city where urban centres are distant and the bike is not necessarily the primary means of movement,” Reen says.
In all of Finland, police information has become slightly less bike theft than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no cause for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police will know a little more than 20,000 bike thefts a year.
It means 50-60 clusters every day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 bikes per year.
\"They're big amounts,\" Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more spins because only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to report a crime of theft, although less than one in ten cases reported to police will survive.
Typically, a wheelchair theft is one where the police get information about theft immediately and the thief gets caught in their blood.
“Explosions can also be found in other investigations, for example, when stolen wheels can be found in a drug case,\" Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves will be caught weekly in the course of the exercise or police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
He said that for example, the wheels are stolen from the wheelchairs, courtyards, warehouses and wheelchairs of the shopping centers, in practice everywhere they are usually kept.
Most of the individual bike models are stolen in the past years, like Jokod.
The U lock gives the wheel better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take a bike for short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen wheels end up selling, for example, via the Internet.
They will remain on the domestic market.
“At least, the police have not known that stolen wheels would go to a very foreign country,” Reen says.
The buyers of the stolen wheels are, according to the police, ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be accurate, for he may be guilty of a crime or a crime of hiding.
“The alarm clocks should be called if they sell a charity bike to their clear bottom,” Reen says.
Special Librarian Officer Severi Hirvi always wears his colorful Nopsa to protect the Kallio Library in Helsinki for his working day.
He has had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen, Hirvi says. “It’s never been taken, there’s been a good monk from there.
“Maybe this doesn’t attract thieves, it’s not necessarily the hipster value,” says the Helsinki-based Hirvi.
Siiri Valve, who quickly dealt with the Kiosk in the Kallio of Helsinki, locked his bike in a small U-class.
Now the wheel turns against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve closes his bike to something solid, like a wheelchair.
“There will be a lot to think about, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own, the Helsinki student says about his white bike, which the body alone cost about five hundred euros.
“All the time I hear from my friends that the wheels have been taken.
Mostly bad wheels, such dirty guys...
A bike was stolen from the guard in the inner yard of the house company a year ago.
However, the wheel had remained unlocked, so Valve could expect it to be analyzed.
Under 15 years of responsibility for his crimes?
Helsinki is testing peer teams familiar with the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer team is being tried to prevent young people from getting into the crime scene.
Initially, the experiment applies to people under the age of 15 who are now left without criminal liability.
The bloodball team is missing the first child to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer team will discuss the incident with the offender and impose sanctions.
A week later, the offender can himself join the peer team to compensate for his actions.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has come to be done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, a youth director, says that the model is not tight.
We also have other conciliation models that are used alongside each other.
“All of the young people are directed in a more responsible direction, so that not everything goes wrong with the first mistake,” Laitito says.
There is a model for the comparison team from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, young people will not be in front of the adult panel, but reflect on what happened to almost the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Palmu service designer Iikka Lovio, who followed the experiment, says that it was an abuse that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of people under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with before.
“It’s been a message that continues on the path you’ve chosen,” Lovio says.
The Vertaisvalaményat is part of the Finnish Migration Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new methods of action are offered to all who need it, not only to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop financing Trump's campaign
Over 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was published in the U.S. Journal of Politico, who had received it to see the draft.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee Reince Priebus.
They want the party's money to be redirected to Congress elections instead of Trump's campaign.
“We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his indiscriminate, insatiable and record disadvantages, threaten to bring to the Democrats in these elections a voice call,” the letter states, according to the Politico.
Only directing all possible funds to Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in Trump decorative anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning presidential elections will decrease from day to day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent next week.
The signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is the Republican Andrew Weinstein, who is obviously opposed to Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from “people who want the parties to protect their majority in Congress” and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump, which are believed to have offended millions of voters.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, President Hillary Clinton announced his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be president so that the U.S. economy will go well for everyone.
\"Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy would go well for him and his friends,\" Clinton said.
Clinton's plan focuses on a massive, $275 billion five-year programme to improve the U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part by rich tax increases, in part by private money.
The construction program is a hands-on for American duunas who suffer from the transfer of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We are a builder, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he also sounded like Sanders to stress that rich people should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if the company goes from the United States to the tax, it has to pay the starting tax, Clinton said.
Today, he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“As President, I object to all trade agreements that operate against employees or wages, Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton, Clinton intended to criticise the economic program published by Republican Donald Trump on Monday that it favors only millions of dollars like this.
Trump's proposed reduction in corporate taxes, Clinton has previously called \"Trump's loopholes\".
Thursday Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded the hearers of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has left without paying, and the clothes Trump himself produces in China and Mexico.
\"If he wants to make America great again, he should start making his own products in America,\" Clinton said.
Such are Rio's viewers: The competitions have not glued Finns to the square, but the mobile app is interested in
Typically, sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have so far not reached the peak of viewers.
At the same time, the competitions have glued to the top of the squares by 12% of the population: on Tuesday night, the swimming pool was followed by 615,000 viewers from Ylen Olympics at the same time.
Because of the comparison: a month ago, the E.M.S.sports received almost 800,000 viewers at a time near TV2 and the football EMs were quite another million.
Most of the Olympics have so far been interested in cycling on Sunday night, and the fifth race day opened a stand that both reached the Olympics channel at once by nearly half a million viewers.
Yle Sport Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the audiences, and reminds us that the viewers are divided in Rio Olympics for the first time into several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Areena.
We are pleased with how much of the TV viewers choose the Olympics.
On the TV side, viewers share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competition to which Yle has owned the entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500 000 all the time, it is a good base.
The number of viewers is lower than in 2012 London competitions or in 2008 Beijing competitions, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large proportion of Rio races will come in Finland at night.
Another reason for a thin interest - if you consider it a thin one now - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the initial competitions, the interest would have been popping up with it.
In addition, sport is just beginning, as are other Finnish-interested species: sailing and riding.
Originally, the number of viewers has been close to the expectations.
When the sport starts, the audiences explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for racing at Apple App Store for free.
By Monday, the app was downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd say we're going to 200 000 downloads now.
“We’ll only get the numbers on the web later,” Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not worked for all users.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come and the mistakes have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been accompanied by a delay and another small technical problem in the early stages.
Updated versions of applications have been made to correct errors.
Rio Olympics appear on Yle channels and arenas more widely than any other sports event ever before.
Yle Fem can track some species, and on the radio, Yle Pele will pass the races every day.
The Olympics are not only working animals to Yle ever, but also the last ones that can be followed only by Yle channels.
Since 2018, Olympic sports will be displayed on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is your Sun, which has a depth of 95.3 meters on the cross.
It may be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical diver, found a 20 square meters heavy on the cross, with a depth of 104 meters on the bottom.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency attempted to confirm the observation by escalating.
The method may not be able to find a small depth of 100 meters, says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
The official depth is therefore still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Inari Lake (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
More than 80 metres from the island, Toiseves and Lakes.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
In particular, the base of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
“There might well be unknown depths, Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
In view of this, your Sun does not reach the ten deepest groups, and the Suvasvez water is still further from the top.
On August 12, at 2.29 p.m., the last piece corrected, where the deepest lakes from the middle depth were wrong.
Ignition of the Tax: Taxation of the Pensions is still more intense
The taxation of pensioners is still more severe than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the situation came under parliamentary elections and that the tax on pensioners was promised to be equal to the payees.
This is not included in the presentation of the Government.
We think that should definitely be it.
The promises made should be followed after the election, he says to the media of the West.
At the beginning of this year, employees received income reductions which reduced taxation.
In the Parliament, the matter grew up with opposition representatives who silenced the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (co.) on the electoral promises.
Purchase power is secure, it does not grow
According to the Minister of Finance Petteri Orpon (Kok.), the tax cuts are mainly about securing and increasing purchasing power, because no wages will be increased next year.
He says that tax reduction has a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase the uncertainty of people.
Ihalainen welcomes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Orpo’s messages about the desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached with effort.
He says that holding the deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy of the government.
It has been done with the power of the social partners, so it should not be challenged.
It comes to the need because the economy has so much in place of domestic demand and people’s own belief in the future.
Long-term unemployment
It calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget line, at least to stop its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was about 17,000 more than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's goal of raising the employment rate to 72% is to run away.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there is a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims in Thailand's attacks
At least four people died in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The Embassy calls on Finnish people in the country to be alerted and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
It is not necessary to cancel your trip to Thailand due to explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the Embassy on caution, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The travel period in Thailand is scheduled for the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand on Facebook after bombing.
In particular, the Embassy has tried to target Finns in Hua Hin to learn about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are now out of town.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, there is no information yet about the cause of the attacks.
The Ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest of a divided society in Thailand and to the last week's referendum on the constitution of a military train.
The law was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country were arrested who said they were opposed to the law.
In the southernmost parts of Thailand, the ethnic conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today there is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, says Westphalen.
He said the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Transport in the city is very little.
The shocks seem to be in the course of the day so that the authorities are very precise about safety.
Thailand Police: The attacks are not about international terrorism.
According to the police, the attacks are a local sabotage and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also excluded, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people died during the day, when 11 bombs have exploded around the country, such as tourists' favorites in Phuket and Hua Hin.
In Finland’s most popular tourist destination, the resort in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, according to Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require death victims.
Two bombs exploded in the city, according to the magazine, at Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the magazine.
According to local authorities, four bombs have exploded yesterday and today.
In both double bombings, at least one died.
In addition, in South Thailand, the Surat Than village and the City of Trang exploded at least one bomb.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Tani is also familiar with many tourists, as it is used to travel to the resorts of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The factor in the attack is not known
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the military train that controls Thailand, the attack is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn’t panic more people, he said to reporters.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the purpose of the factors was to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks had occurred in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on Finnish people in the country to be alerted and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
In Thailand, it is not necessary to cancel your journey because of explosions, but it is worth noting the instructions on caution, says Westphalen.
In injured Europeans
There are very few attacks in Finland during the night and their victims are known so far.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has been able to get a little more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, among which there were at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's second attack.
Two bombs exploded in front of the famous bell tower.
Thai PBS says the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin from which it believes it has found another bomb.
The Surat Than bomb was hidden in a flower cap, according to the governor of the county.
A local worker died in the attack.
There is at least one injured.
CNN's police chief says that two bombs were used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded about half an hour ago.
Bangkok Post said the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles won women's four-games
The US Alexandra Raisman was the second score of 60,098 and the Russian Alija Mustafina with the third score of 58,665.
Biles, 18 is still in Rio's competition for tennis medals with permana, jump and boom.
Biles has been managing women's gymnastics to the point of view over the past few years.
From the last three years, he has eight personal world championships.
He has won the four championships and the permansion championships three times in a row, as well as the boom last and the second year.
In the US team, Biles has won two teams' world championships.
Biles have jumps and booms.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: \"The person has no impact on tourism.
Esa Huovila, a children’s playground in Phuket, is not concerned about the impact of Thailand’s bomb attacks on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don’t think there will be anything more amazing about this, it is estimated by Huovila as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen a lot of tragedy in Thailand.
There's always something here.
First was tsunami, then avian flu and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these previous tourists have not banished tourists, this is hardly the case either.
Huovila's company office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard of the attack from his own employee.
The employee called about nine local times and said he shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought that roadblocks had been placed for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at around 10:00 a.m. for local time.
On the beach, many had not even heard of attacks.
At half a day, Thailand’s time in Patong’s traffic was normalized and much of the stores had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila said.
Later, this car was seen in Kruunupy with Jouxholm.
When the police got there, the car was set to burn.
The party found two men who fit in with their senses hidden in the close six.
The other man was caught right away.
The other one ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage to the operation of the motor vehicle.
The police thank you for the tips given.
Research Director of Russian leadership changes: Clear deportation
On Friday, the highest-ranking change in leadership took place in Russia, when President Vladimir Putin separated the head of his administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is an Estonian-style 44-year-old Anton Vauno.
He's an ex-diplomate and worked as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's separation can be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from collecting too much power.
He adds that recycling of managerial tasks is one of the ways of using power.
This is a way of preventing people from gathering independent power from the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been forced into chains with other executives or mutated.
Ivanoville Station Loss
Ivanov, a member of Putin's internal borders, is transferred to the special tasks of environmental and transport matters.
With a tape presented by the state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed Vavo to replace him, said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, it is a clear loss of position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian power.
Ivanov has also played a major role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union at KGB.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but was president of Dmitry Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that old maps, such as Governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
A senior researcher from Katri Pynnönniemi's Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin will change his neighborhood to a younger one.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when they retreated to Syria.
They used civilians as a human shield to escape to the city of Jarabulus, so as not to target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arabs and Kurdishs managed about 90% of the city of Manbij, which is important to Isis.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists stayed in the city.
The earlier news was corrected at 19:30: In the past, we misinformed that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The Policy of the Ministry of the Interior is unlawful
The Ministry of the Interior's guidance on the publication of documents is illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of Public Law from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen tells the STT that the publication of documents cannot be based on the authority’s own guidelines, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to submit the list of participants of the Interior Minister's events to East Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision by the instructions of the Government Office and by the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Head of Communications of the Ministry tells the STT that there is a need to reform practices in the ministry.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic Show starts in Rio
As in the last few years, Bolt has run against time under the prizes.
He hurt his way back from the beginning and had to leave the Jamaican Olympics behind.
This has not been the perfect preparation, but I’m much better in shape.
I've been doing well and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
This press conference included small-scale sambatants and fans.
Porina Bolt is underlined by the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in the era of the struggle for public sports with doping scandals and lulling interest.
Bolt's previous defeat in the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he was cut off from 200 metres in the early 21.05.
At that time, the 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by the injuries and loosening of your training position.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began by a hundred meters, in which he crushed the world record and the self-confidence of competitors in a period of 9.69.
This is harder
A year later, in Berlin’s World Championships, Bolt reached his career at the end of his career at the clock.
World records born in Berlin are still valid at 9.58 hundred metres and 19.19 two hundred.
Riosa Bolt has announced that he is pursuing 200 metres of world record and 19 seconds of sublime, but no one else believes in its birth.
Satasella Bolt is the very challenger of the Ateenan 2004 Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year, in Beijing’s World Cup, Bolt lost the American in just one hundred-second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost in the finals of the prizes once if only he has reached the road.
In Daegus 2011 the World Cup of the 100th century remained without running from Bolt due to a flash start.
Bolt will fill in in a lot of weeks after 30.
He's an old man in the breed of young men, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the next year's World Championships in London.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the rest of them.
I'm older and this is harder.
But whenever I am in the lower countries, I remind myself: this year I must do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Disclosures from Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to Xinhua, China’s state news agency Chen Xinyi, 18, has given positive doping samples at Rio Olympics.
The doping sample of the Chinese swimmer Chen Xiny found traces of banned substances.
Also, the Bulgarian drink Silvia Danekov is suspected of a doping crime.
In addition, the Kenyan general sports coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given doping samples with signs of epo-hormon.
He was ranked in Rio in the fourth place in women's 100 metres of butterfly spray.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estao, the Chinese capital has taken its doping cases to the International Court of Appeal for Sport CAS.
Xinhua says that a sample given by Xiny on Sunday would have found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping episodes have also been revealed in Rio.
BBC News that Bulgarian women's drinks Silvia Danekova has given doping samples with signs of epo-hormon.
Kenya has, on the other hand, sent a sports coach from Rio home because of the doping thing.
The International Olympic Committee KOK said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had made the test as a athlete and had given a doping sample for this.
According to media data, it's a Chinese fast-track coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used a 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotichi's pass.
Phelps can't stop anything - the historical gold came in the display style
The most successful athlete in Olympia history, the United States Michael Phelps swims 200 metres in the mix of his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympics.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve the same species of Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive races.
The Phelps won time was 1.54.66.
Japan’s Kosuke Hagino was ranked second in confusion before China’s Wang Shunia.
I'm just trying to have some fun, BBC Olympic Commander Helen Skelton laughs at a quick interview in the afternoon.
Helen Skelton (a.k.a.) on Monday is one of the most read sites this week.
Next to the commenter Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not have much stress if there is a small noise in the media or in the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is a visual media, she emphasizes.
Skelton has dressed in high-rise shoes and short dress with at least sufficient publicity - at least for the eyes of many conservative British athletes.
However, there are no back steps.
It's important to look good, and the small coffees are just a fun thing.
Skelton will surely want to scare you and maybe bother you, but he emphasizes that you don't want to be in the main role.
It's not about me, he says.
Here we are watching sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter how I dress.
Can you imagine that the coffee has reached Finland?
I can't, but all that focuses on how hard these swimmers do their work and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skellon's pushing.
You know what?
It’s a treat from scratch if it comes from wearing (the driver).
I'm having fun with a little bit if someone's been hit like this.
Rio's police have two arrests due to a terrorist attack.
On Thursday, Rio Police announced that it has arrested two people because of a terrorist attack.
Police arrested in the context of the security control of the races.
In the same context, the police made five other arrests and interviewed two persons before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, the persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group, whose members were arrested by the police in July.
The arrested are believed to have links with the ISIS.
The arrests were known to have triggered violence in social media.
The message of violence was distributed in the popular WhatsApp service, among other things.
The safety of Rio's races is equivalent to 85,000 police officers.
Police blew up a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place in the audience.
The police let the public in after the package had been blown up in control.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics, when the police have performed a controlled explosion mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package.
The public got in when the police had fired the package.
The public did not record the game by the beginning, because the police closed the arena for the last time due to the suspicious package found in the smell.
The police blew up the package and released the public until after that.
The tank awakened the contests with a dream to start the Spanish team.
In two losses, Spain won the Nigerian score from 96 to 87.
In two previous races, Spain achieved silver.
The police have already performed a controlled explosion task for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Last time, the police were forced to blow up a suspicious discovery in the vicinity of the road bike in the vicinity of the destination last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty views.
Argentinian lady wears Petija-Siren - Finnish think of protest
The wind in Petaja-Siren was a colorful day of competition in Rio.
The wind in Petaja-Sire was hard on Thursday.
Argentinian lady wears Tuuli Petija-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surf day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant admitted the breach.
He got stuck because of the crash, and the others ran away, Finland’s head coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing that because it would have been unnecessary according to the Olympic rules.
I should have dropped in the water to get a refund, Petajar-Siren said.
The Finnish man hung on his desk until the last time because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnish people left their 27th place with the crash.
In the overall situation, London’s 2012 Olympic hop medalist is the eighth.
With respect to the lungs, the carb didn't seem to have much effect.
Friday is an important day when the race starts 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petajar-Siren did not make protests.
7 special things that, according to science, extend the age
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring additional years to a person’s life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life is extended.
Sometimes things that a person can’t influence can bring him additional years.
These include a tendency to middle-body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend the age.
You don't always have to collide, just apply for a milk can.
The secret of a long age has been sought to find out in many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven strange research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drink has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
The Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a reduced risk of death, especially with regard to neurological or cardiovascular diseases.
On behalf of alcohol, there are once again studies that suggest that reasonable use - one in three days - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived as parents as people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of dental tape can extend a person’s life even over six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents infection.
They can, on the other hand, contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
The research conducted in Norway found out how laughter affected human life.
Over 54,000 people looked at the project for over seven years.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when gender protection is taken into account, is good for health according to many studies.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have additional years of life, he should also receive orgasm.
Traffic will bring additional years, but it will not be contested.
However, achieving a long age does not require absolute consistency.
One study at Oxford University found that women with a big back side had lower cholesterol levels.
Their body also had more omega 3 fatty acids.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it was an actor who won the Olympics or an Oscar, he is more likely to live longer than a regular bully.
Many studies have tried to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation can be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life to life for additional years.
Some researchers suspect that a long-term age is the result of a person’s social status – which, in turn, allows the Nobel Prize, for example, to pursue such recognitions.
A study of shopping behaviour in people over 65 years of age found that a person shopping every day, probably less likely to make purchases as a parent.
This is due to the fact that in concrete stores rotation reduces loneliness.
It has also been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to death.
So let's count your credit card on your hand, so online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
Umpihuman bike driver blows towards the truck
On Friday night, a heavy truck and passenger car crane was held in Koskella.
The accident occurred in Koskella, between Koskent and Sorvastont on Friday at 21:00.
The truck had been driving towards Forssa, when the passenger car that came against me had driven to the same lane, hit the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was able to run, but burned.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car sank into the stream and then passed over to the roof.
A woman born in 1972, carrying a passenger car, remained in her car.
The rescue facility removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to the Turku University Hospital.
The result of a woman's blowout was 2.02 prom.
He's suspected of being a drunk drunk.
Posts send boxes to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in Salon K-Citymarket's lattice selection, as the mail had accidentally delivered some of the load to the Seinajoki.
Teija Haltia in Perniö was on Thursday buying bulk boxes from Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit her in the eyes.
Unfortunately, the Irish have product shortcomings because Posti delivered our loads to the Seinajoki!
We get more when Posti gets the delivered load!
If there's no congestion in the lawn, the sign reads.
The shopkeeper’s sticky sign relates to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowers.
The food is offered by Post until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update hit me with an idiot.
The media’s representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention of this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday evening, the Haltia update had more than 700 divisions on Facebook.
Haltia got her favorites caught in a box of loose sheets, even though a few camps were empty.
Jaakko Kaideso, responsible for the business of Posti Company Transportation Services, regretted the damage to East Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stages went into the wrong place yesterday (Seinajoki) and we no longer went to do a partial delivery (Saloon) on three, but only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
This is the first news of the evening.
Teija Haltia did not get upset about the sign because she found a selection of all her own antiques.

Wish of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the Victim for the benefit of the police dogs
A week ago, a 42-year-old woman in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered for the benefit of a police dog instead of flowers and challenges.
The Sipoon Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update that conveys the wishes of the victim’s family for the benefit of the police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoon Veterinary Centre and had also completed his nursing training there.
The medical station remembers the words that touch the woman.
Happy, smart, humorous, and unerrivaled work.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that donations will go to police dogs as a whole, primarily for the purchase of security tapes.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old holiday woman was murdered in her own backyard in Loviisa, Koskkenkylä.
The women’s neighbors have told the evening magazine the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flowers.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder did not know a woman and had no connection with each other.
The killer was traced by a police dog Börje, who was wounded in a life-threatening situation.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The Court of Justice gave Post a judgment on the violation of the Law of Equality
The Post did not have the right to arrest the salary of the employee who refused to study the temporary worker, according to Kanta-Hämeen’s judgment.
The right to pay Post’s employees most of the paid salary and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested only part of the employer's salary, which corresponded to the proportion of the study for the whole day's work.
According to the case law, the employee was placed in a more favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity in violation of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the ban on the establishment of the Union for Posti and Logistics (PAU).
During the Postage Act last November, PAU made a decision that Post workers would not be familiar with temporary workers who break the strike.
It was first reported by the People's News.

Putin fired the chief of his administration - replaces the Estonian-like Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has resigned President Sergei Ivanov, President of the Board of Presidents, the Kremlin says.
The Soviet-Viron Communist Director, Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vauno, will be present.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
It also becomes a member of the Russian Security Council, the news agency Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired the chief of his administration.
According to the Kreml report, Ivanov, a close internal circle of Putin, is moving to the special tasks of environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov had himself asked for a transfer to other tasks and suggested that Vauno be replaced, Russian Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the spying of the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov as a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: Manu's giant purchase of a game ban - not to be seen in the opening of Valoliiga
The world record man for football transfers is not seen in the field when England is kicked off for the weekend.
Paul Pogba’s ban on playing followed England.
Manchester United's giant Paul Pogba is on the side of ManU opening his league on Sunday against Bournemouth, said BBC on Friday.
ManU paid EUR 105 million for the Italian club Juventus, according to British media.
However, the British Football Association (FA) keeps him out of the game, for Pogba was left under the ban on the game.
He received two warnings from the Italian Cup last season, and it becomes a single game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told BBC.
Pogba’s next port to play is on the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
Flow's great madness is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally prestigious event, marked by the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Fester walkers have typically expressed themselves in their own clothes.
One of the main artists is punk legend Iggy Pop this year.
Flow Festival’s event area is hosted, among other things, by artificial grass and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main plate and a beer, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival, held in the Summer Gulf of Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small block festival to the events of tens of thousands of visitors.
The question behind the success is simple: What kind of event would the factors themselves want to go?
It is quite unusual to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and operate in accordance with the authority regulations, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to be sold out this year.
The goal has been to raise the number of 70,000 people in the last year with 5,000 people.
This year, a group of interesting domestic and foreign artists will be seen.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing because it has to be financed somehow.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point mass would be like a flock, which is directed at huge highways.
That's what we don't want.
Over the past 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been highlighted in such a way that there are 130 performers, art sites, as well as numerous restaurants and drinks.
In addition to the main and smaller ships, this year, 15,000 people operate on tents.
Kallio admits that the event could be done more easily.
Maybe I'm a little crazy, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, it's not our case anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done by Kallio is that today, even the great visions are practically possible.
During the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the activity was highly dependent on the support of around €20,000 in the City of Helsinki.
Last year, the turnover of the stock company running Flow was around EUR 6 million.
It allows you to do some Greek things, like building a tent that is 73 meters wide.
Flow’s visitors have typically expressed themselves in their own clothes.
In addition to the music event, it is possible to talk about the trendy adult community of young people.
However, the event is not consciously profiled as a particular fashion.
We want to be separated first and foremost with content.
However, fashion phenomena are also suitable for Flow's world of value: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment,” Kallio says.
This year, one of the main artists of the main stage is the legend of the pound, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he does not have the most typical performers at the indierock, pop music, rap and solo festival.
According to Kallio, Iggy was busted because now is probably the last time we see it in the gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's being played on commercial radio.
Iggy's last album is damn good and he's been doing good gigs in the last few years.
Thailand's tourist parasitic bombs were hidden in the bouquets of flowers - tourists fled their horrors
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were hidden in a flower bag and exploded with cell phones.
Bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists began to leave bars and return to their hotels, according to the police representative Samier Yoosumra CNN.
Since 1989, the wild animal protector Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, tweeted a large-scale picture of the attacks.
If the TV doesn't look good, you can watch it from here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
The people ran against me and said that the bomb had exploded at the bar.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, told Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of injured persons is not yet known.
Two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket.
No one is known to have died.
At the same time, Hua Hin had another double bomb attack.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police reportedly found at least one bomb that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel troops behind the bomb attacks, which are not satisfied with the operations of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, it may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken on the activities of criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new troops will begin the battle in a military situation.
In an acute military situation, the military forces will be ordered to battle until several months after the oath of the military light, according to the Central Finlandan.
According to Professor Jukka Sonninen, the Defence Forces Training Commander, who has been interviewed by the newspaper, for example, in a military situation of 5.5 months of service, only those who are at the end of their education are eligible for combat.
According to the Head of Education, the service is first assigned to the reserve members of the emergency staff.
No backup or reserve member shall be ordered for a task that has not been provided for the required training, Sonninen says.
In the summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces are taking up the training of the backup forces for immediate readiness units from next year.
If necessary, units may be used in military activities already during military training.
Pamela Tola received a giant compensation from the home house
The actor Pamela Tola and his former husband, Pauli Waroma, have won a harsh dispute about the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The trading price of a two-storey separate house was EUR 330 000.
However, after trading, there was a serious moisture problem in the house that caused a dangerous microbic growth in health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in the summer of 2014.
The sales price had fallen to 132,000 euros, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma was almost EUR 198,000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both court and court.
The court gave judgment on Wednesday.
It was in force in the District Court judgment ordering the seller to pay to Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the trial and clearing costs of the couple.
The right to a reasonable price reduction was slightly due to the fact that some of the need to repair the apartment had already been known to the buyers when it was trading in the apartment.
However, according to the court law, the apparent building errors were essentially more serious than what had been proposed.
Tola is looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had been looking for a good home because they didn’t want to do repairs.
He was given the idea that the building was under renovation and in good condition and that there was no harm to the aspects mentioned in the health check report.
The municipal inspection report referred to the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rainwater and melting water from rock learning.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it was not clear that this was a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma realized that rainwater from a rock should be driven a little over a few years.
The goods were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the watering problems of the apartment were much more serious.
In the 2012 and 2013 inspections, the building found microbic growth rates due to both rock rainfall and capillarally rising land pollution.
According to the inspector, air contaminated by microbes in the west, could also enter the interior through the fibre.
Healthy risk-friendly, limit values across the mold or yeast were found in the brush samples in the homeroom, in the basement staircase, in the living room window box, and in the basement laundry room.
Steels built without permits
The law also contested whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the city of Espoo before the transaction, according to which the illegal changes had been made to the apartment.
Among other things, the terraces were built, although there were no appropriate permits.
Home problems were, however, a key issue in court.
According to the court law, buyers could assume from the seller before trading on the basis of the information they had received, that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for measuring repairs in the near future.
In Tola and Waroma, there was no special reason to carry out a more conventional inspection.
The buyers have not neglected their reporting obligations, according to the court’s judgment.
Rough stocking: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to the Nazis - also in the register of Finns
The journalist Christopher Andersson wrote in his recent article on Dagens Nyheter, how the U.S. National Archives, Maryland, has documents stored on microfilms, covering a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are German, but also American, French, Dutch and Russian are involved.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be a Nazi musician.
The documents and registration cards are from the Nazi-German breed agency.
The breed agency operated under the leadership of the SS under Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true for women who had to be able to give up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were conducted for women to investigate the matter.
The Breeding Office examined women’s backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
The goal was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to provide life-cycles and good recommendations from close relatives.
The Bureau wanted to guarantee that women were “loved” and “saving” and “good national socialists” who knew very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as a bride of SS men.
The case does not tell us how 14 Finnish women found in the archives were.
SS leaders created a state-backed program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program ordered that each SSman should have four children, either in marriage or outside it.
Lebensborn homes care for children born outside of marriage and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the U.S. Holocaust Museum pages.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The German mother’s honoraryist was given to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between the Aryans, and non-Aryans were prohibited by law, the museum’s pages state.
The 6th of Petajar Sire, the Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was ranked third of the sailing at the first departure of Finnjolle Day at Rio Olympics, but remained the whole set of dusks for the second day.
The Nircko rose eight times after five exits, but the failure of the second exit dropped him in position 14.
Wind Petajar-Sire fought for RS:X class day departures in 17 and 3.
In the overall situation, Petaja-Siren is the sixth.
In the 470s, Jonas and Niklas Lindgren stayed at the opening of the day.
Lindgrens are ranked 19.
Jari Sillanpää's satulinna was recorded at a couple of hours' nights: \"I was so in a cloth.
Jari Sillanpää has been part of Finnish favorite artists for more than 20 years.
From the cruise ship’s barmaid to the 1995 tango queen, Finland’s best-selling soloist, and the Sillanpää, as star of dance festivals and painters, continued to suffocate and is currently in a shady boost.
A book written by Mari Koppes, about the life of a favorite singer, Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana was released on Thursday.
The book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
The career of Sillanpää rose to a full rise in his victory in the Tango market of the crown of the Tango River in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had written to Sillanpää, at the request of a man, a piece of tango, which was adapted by Kassu Halonen to a slightly different form.
The song satulinna became one of the most popular songs in the history of Finnish music.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go as planned: Sillanpää sang it on the tape in a terrible collar and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so dressed!
Sillanpää remembers in the book.
It would not immediately be thought that it was sung in a hangover.
Although I wasn’t physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that it is not always necessary to demand the perfect and the top.
One of the most popular songs of a man, the book says, happened nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then partner, and the case ended up earning gold, which was published as singles in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Saara Kohäs were not the same as Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record, telling a story about his own life, but the words of the song about the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the 7-day news.
In the news of the magazine, the reason for the difference between Jar and the ex-loved one was the excessive celebration and alcohol use of Jar, but Jar said it was a full pop and not true.
She called the book and refused to sing the song, but finally ended up singing it, and good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the voting week’s opinion polls anticipate the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institution or university flagged the difference, although a couple of individual researchers might disagree with the mainstream power of their profession.
On the basis of Western politics, the former US President Bill Clinton’s upcoming election campaign, “It’s the economy, the studios – flew to the wreck in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic Kihara
The Centre for Macroeconomics takes the most recent month's survey of professional responses to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the loss of the economic position of economists is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of jobs, almost standard.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the right UK.
Many people also have the idea that a reduction in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the economists, voters did not believe in economic arguments because the consensus of the economists did not come up sufficiently.
In particular, the BBC's equity was reduced, which only gave as much room for a few percent of EU economists who were in favour of eco-economics as the overwhelming majority.
The EU's hate press was not interested in telling us what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE are about the consequences of the gap.
These far-reaching letters spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the economist’s messages were both listened and understood, they were not transmitted because the economists represent an elite with whom voters do not think they have common interests.
The academics of major cities such as economists would have remained in the EU, but the message was not effective in small cities and rural areas.
Immigration is also an economy.
The overwhelming victory argument for the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrant takes your job, the immigrationer rushes your hospital, the migrant uses you for good.
These arguments did.
Every cafe has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre has a waiting room for immigrants.
How much easier would the British get doctors if they weren’t?
There are also children of immigrants in each school.
How much easier would it be for the children of the right British to get out of school?
Every municipality is home to foreigners.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
These relate to jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them, and if they succeeded, their answers did not become visible.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, Britain has even more jobs, less health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and in particular EU immigrants - are the net taxpayers of the British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund was reserved for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, the property of which is the Finnish Pertti Olden.
In Aberdeen, he said, early Brexit was prepared for the A and B plans.
Plan B, i.e. the winning of an EU-sponsored camp, began to be prepared for more details a few weeks before the vote in case the result would be a good one.
It took care that investors would withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have large amounts of liquid funds, but they could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on Day 23, we had 25% of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says about Aberdeen’s only open day-to-day property fund, which the news relates to.
According to the old people, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
At that time, the value of the fund was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is around £20 billion.
It was the highest number in the nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says all of the British real estate funds open.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was less than or equal to 10%.
So the real estate funds reserved for Brexit in different strategies.
Funds shut down trading
When the camp in favour of the EU was won, Europe went crazy.
However, the few two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were very quiet, Vanhanen says.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech of Mark Carney, the CEO of the Central Bank of England, where he estimates that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
Together, the situation was shaken and brought to the main points of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball began to spin, and the fund after each other had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it had to finally freeze its trading for six days.
According to the old ones, they did not actually close trading, but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether money should now be drawn out in panics.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it wouldn't be worth it, for it would be lost.
It calmed down the situation, and most of them cancelled the notification.
Since then, it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, the old man says.
He points out that, for example, the Aberdeen Manner-Europe funds have had no similar blows.
However, there were a lot of questions.
Unfairly paying attention to real estate funds
According to the old people, the closures of real estate funds were given an unreasonable amount of attention.
The open funds, which were covered by the closures, are dominated by about four per cent of the UK's properties.
The Aberdeen lock lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds on to half of 2017.
Currently there is uncertainty in the air, and the economic growth forecasts have been reduced, but the situation does not seem to be more important to Aberdeen.
The biggest issues are now about the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has brought some of the real estate investors even new opportunities, the old man points out.
The exchange rate of the pound and the dollar is at its lowest for 30 years, and in addition, the market has a 15% discount compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property at up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit introduced mines to the London real estate market
In the morning, the situation didn’t look like much.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, who was responsible for the real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was another.
That's the word of power.
I realized that this is going on the B side of the planet, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He went to work right away.
London City was still alive in the morning.
The television screens that were normally silent at the office made the news, and usually the loud people were silenced to listen completely when Prime Minister David Cameron came to the camera in the morning to tell the difference.
When the market opened, the screen endings flashed red only.
It was the morning that he would never believe in, the old man said.
Not because, despite the mystery, Aberdeen, one of the largest real estate funds in the UK, finished two real estate stores on the day after the Brexit vote.
The mood was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for an alternative, and that was why the situation was kind of calm,\" the old man says.
The Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
A pound collapsed, the British leader went on the switch.
The market started to expect a sharp fall in the UK and, in particular, in the London real estate market.
London office premises were expected to lose up to 20% in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the poison is broken, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
It doesn’t look like the last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He believes it is too early to say much about what is going on with Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already become the first information.
The CBRE information on price developments in the real estate service company covers about a third of the market.
According to these, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, the decline was 6.1 per cent, the old man reads.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're months of change.
The monthly index was published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All the same fall hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was compared very quickly with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate markets.
The old man believes that the comparison is not quite a hit, because it is now the UK’s domestic crisis.
The atmosphere is another.
The real estate market has not now been seen as a panic sale like that time, but a willingness to sell liquidity, says the old man.
The funding can also be found normally.
The repair could have been in front of you anyway.
In fact, the price repair business isn't a miracle about him, it could have been like this without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of properties in London and other world top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and, in particular, the offices are overrated, the old man says.
So the fall began very high.
London prices have written up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London has grown as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is globalized, the Old Man says.
In the Middle East and Asia, new players have become on the market, and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fed by low interest rates, which, for example, pension companies have been forced to search for revenues from new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been easily available - although, according to the old man, the loan has now been used clearly less than in the period before the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, disperse
In London, the rise in prices was balanced last summer, says the old man.
Aberdeen also began to reduce its ownership in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of translation to wait for, and now it came.
What's going on here?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He is not afraid to evaluate the future, but he says that there is hardly any uplift.
The feeling suggests that there is a fall or a steady passage in front of you.
The old man has seen several movements up and down since 1988, as he has been in the real estate sector.
And he's still an optimist who believes that he's going to get rid of the hole by work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in one market, there's too much of that sacrifice.
If you're scattered, the risks are also scattered, the old man says.
The S Group will start to register the purchase information in more detail
As soon as the S Group knows what you are eating, the trading group said today that it will start collecting more information about the purchases of its parent customers.
So far, when information has been collected about the final amount of the receipt, the group will begin to hesitate to do so at the beginning of May.
The S-Group comes after Kesko here, because the information on the goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in the Kesko customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Ritalan, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has mainly been positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer’s consent and used for marketing.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
Quite a few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Economics.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to the change in the registration of the S-Group.
Kesko is already classifying its carrier customers according to the food purchases in ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Kanta customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money used for them.
Data is used for customer-focused marketing.
The product-specific purchase information is collected only from the K-group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a carrier client program and this is not the case with this one.
The Finnish Middle Market has its own One-stop shop client program, which can be associated with the Electoral Houses, Siwos and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect information on product or product group levels, we remain on the level of the final amount of the receipt.
So we know where the purchase was made, and that day, and the final amount of the customer’s receipt.
We have not gone to a level like the K-Group or the S-Group, says the commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, it will be planned to reform the client’s programme in the future, but the Middle Trade will tell you about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that the product information will be registered.
Initially experimenting
So far, SOK’s customer and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address data, the basic information includes professional, education, form of residence, birth years of children and previous personal data.
People in the same economy and their roles are also registered.
The S-Etu card purchase is stored on the date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of purchases and the method of payment.
In addition, information from S bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prisma, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, data is currently recorded at product group level.
Customers have been hoping for a longer time to focus more on marketing, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer and Partner Activities of SOK.
The S Group says they will inform their customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in cats in any case, wanted it or not.
Halukas can check your stored information on the S-Group website.
For example, the cashiers cannot access the data, emphasizes Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-fashion is Tulli's latest dog fixation - the prophecy becomes the first explosive dog
The black labradorinator's puppy is heavily hatched with five boxes of the same country lined to Helsinki-Vantaa Airport.
It won’t take long for it to sit next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with its favorite toy.
The box next to which Heila sat revealed a jar of seals that would repel the radishing gas.
Ruuti gas is the first smell that Heila and Heila have now been practiced, says Suntio, the owner of Heila’s dog.
Security situation and online trade access
Heila is the first dog specialized in the search for weapons and explosives in Tulli and is placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also be carried to other border crossings and ports as necessary by Heila and Suntion.
However, the airport will be the main workplace of Heila, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks of Paris and Brussels were caused by measures in Customs, and after the attacks, surveillance has been confirmed, says Tullin Inspector Mikko Grönberg.
Another access to the duties of Customs for the training of weapons and explosives dogs is postal transmission through Helsinki-Vantaa.
With an increased internet trade, up to 40 million mails pass through the airport each year, among which arms and explosives may be ordered abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made online shopping, passenger luggage and air freight at Helsinki Airport for approximately 300 weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives, as well as their precursors.
Heila will work across Helsinki.
It will investigate registered luggage and mail.
In ports it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large containers and mark areas that require more accurate research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, Customs assess whether the arms and explosives dogs will be trained to increase in the future.
Grönberg is looking forward to the idea.
School in the church
Heila-pennuu training is coordinated by the Tulli Dog School in Kirkkonumme.
Suntio also attends training with Heila with police and defense experts.
The police have strong experience in the training of dogs and in the Defence Forces with expertise in explosives.
Customs will decide, together with other authorities, what smells Heila will be taught to recognize.
Heila is always trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues in Helsinki-Vantaa are Tullin’s six drug dogs, as well as the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador's picker Heila has been chosen for 10 puppy puppies.
The selection criteria for a dog to choose at the airport include tearing and hunting, as well as peace, as the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives, and human flows.
Heila is a close friend to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing without Heila gets home, Suntio laughs.
The fine orders go to Heila from a single box.
The cameraman of the night-says will lose a camera mask to the fast dog, but Heila will return a soft toy-looking cover from the immediate-hair-hand.
Hard competition from working dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
There is still a level test ahead, the next October, where it is estimated that education will be sufficient for work tasks.
Heila can be seen at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plans.
Unfortunately, travelers cannot come to smooth the working vests of the dog on it, reminds us of Suntio.
The cost of a single working dog is around EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working age is about seven or eight years, and after which they will retire to the care of their owner.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active working hours can only last from 10 minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of working dogs is a hard competition in Customs.
Heila's owner was approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
Good luck hit Suntion who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in the Customs.
The Empire has its first Olympic medal - the people get a day off.
At Rugby, the Olympics of Fiji, with less than a million inhabitants, are valued in the country so high that the government has ordered August 22th national holiday.
According to the country's broadcasting company, Fiji's government confirmed the case after the championship was settled.
Free day is held for the team to return home the next day.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in his country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian says that the country was followed by the final in the capital city of Suva, where the stadium had been erected a screen.
Normally, only native Fijins are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encouraging, said the journalist of the Fiji Times to Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish composer passed out after the execution
Milko Tokola, a weightlifter, succeeded with his last company from 175 pounds after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature.
During or immediately after the hard rises, he has been swirled several times.
No one could really say why.
In Rio, Tokola received 175 pounds and 145 pounds.
His combined result was 320 pounds.
Tokola was trying to get his job at the end of 175 pounds, as well as in the other.
With the third company, the weights rose as a result of loud screams.
The crown was under pressure until the jury accepted the pickup.
The joy of a Finnish teacher was that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS was acquired by official artist Prosan - Veikkausliiga - East Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Club, playing in the football league of men, has concluded a sustainable contract with the Estonian athlete Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a team of top players with power and the threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
With over ten players, we went through a lot of 50 players from all over the world.
A small number began to stand out as a good alternative to Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen, said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Tallin Flora, where he scored 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian National Team.
Prosan is scheduled to be with RoPS on Saturday in the Seinajoki, where the Rovaniemis meet with the Finnish master SJK.
RoPS had a need for a new attacker when Alexander Kokko moved to Australia during the last season.
The threatening modern family star meets again: teen-star shorts reveal almost everything.
A modern family comedy series, a friend of Alex Dunphyna’s acquaintances, re-introduces Ariel Winter by presenting her proud body.
Winter was photographed in Hollywood this week in minishorts, which don’t leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor’s feet but also the back of this.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making its style and behavior much more courageous.
The star has positioned in the pictures published in social media in very little clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen to wear very little clothes.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has recently published several photos of itself celebrating.
If the picture doesn't show, you can look at it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has radically changed her public image.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerWomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter had a \"typical Hollywood-forming\" change, from child star to adult.
He has been on television for almost all his life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more he shows the surface, the more publicity and attention he receives in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the modern family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has upset some of his long-term fans with his imago change.
It’s not hard to guess where he will be in ten years’ time when he’s already about as hard as he is, says a woman in Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the women’s fans, however, defend the actor and ask to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what others say.
You are inspired by many women, a young woman.
Japan wants to visit the Nordics, preferably to Finland - tourists are attracted to Revontul: In the autumn it is possible to see a random storm aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start the renovation journeys from the beginning, Visit Finland says in the newsletter.
Japan's main destinations are Inari and Levi.
The Revon lights are our winter travel carts, and they are strongly connected to the winter and beautiful landscapes.
In the winters of Lapland, we have a very high demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
It’s rare to know that the revolution is beginning from the autumn of the past and continues to be long in the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called “mirror aurora” in which the lake’s surface reflects the revolution lights made from the vision of a two-fold random, says the Marketing Manager Anne Lind.
The main target group of the Visit Finland Revontuli campaign is the wealthy Japanese women aged 25 to 35, who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, including online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers from Turku and Tokyo universities, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see more unique attractions in Finland, and this Revontula says that there is a huge potential.
Stays of Japanese travellers have grown significantly more than other Nordic countries in Finland.
Last year, they stayed more than twice in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
Japan is interested in Finland’s tourism as a target group because they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, Japanese people spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
The UK is satisfied with the Master's course organised by Rugbyhopea Fidi in leading to gold
The impressive progress of the UK in the rugby tournament collapsed to the final challenge of Fiji in the Thursday evening, when the team experienced 43-7 strokes at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi arranged a master's course in processing, chewing, racing, support games, runners, and silk when they won the gold - their first Olympic medal.
The battle was accompanied by a reasonable consolation of the silver medalist - the third of the British day - and they were proud of their hard work in the Olympic Rugby start-up tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In the past, a strong 7-5 win of the semi-final played on the same day in South Africa could make them more difficult in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a team of 15 people.
The UK may - but probably not - comfort the fact that at least one British will have a gold medal in his neck tomorrow: Fidi's head coach is Ben Ryan, England's former boss Wimbledon.
Great Britain's journey has been quite.
Eight years ago, they lost every game in Adelaide's tournament.
This is where they lost only one.
This is happening in the back of the sauna, but the development is shocking.
Fidi started to fight Britain's trades for fun.
With Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like they were running moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived into the corner of the goal area.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right side led to a goal kick.
12-0, and the UK had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great tactic stopped the man-male Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it was only slow for Fiji.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalu made a goal at the right angle, and the UK lost 17-0.
Nakarawa once again scored a goal for a new initiative, and the clock still had more than a minute... the first half of the time.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou clashed through the UK’s discovery of the bars and rushed to the line to make a goal.
After the landing, the situation was 29-0.
It seemed as if Fidi had been born to play rugby, while the UK only taught the game.
And that's what it really is.
The UK made changes to the gap by a dozen, which blocked the Fidi dam... into a total of four minutes, which was well compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored the goal after the active feed game of Fid.
Dan Norton caught a goal for the United Kingdom in the left corner of Touchdown and narrowed the situation to numbers 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in views.
It was difficult not to admire Fid’s positive approach.
Mata Viliame's last-minute goal was to freeze in Fide's cake, which didn't need to be stuck.
The pilot was hated, the Fidis were hugged, and the UK fell on the lawn, completely hit.
Formerly on the same day, Fidi had hit Japan in a semi-final 20-5, and the UK won South Africa in a tight semi-final where both scored one goal - the British goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown took the lead in South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish area with a dazzling footwork and scored a goal in less than a second half.
A great late guarantee from Marcus Watson, England's 15-aside-rugby team from Anthony's brother, guaranteed the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer led Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to war.
In these races there will be no more painful gold, and it really means something.
From the first draw to the last, 220 hard races towards the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were rowing together, there were three voices in the boat. Coach Robin Williams' echo was there all the time, when the other two would boast their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's couple competition - the first women in the British sports history books that reached such achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance undefeated, which is also a record.
This is what we see, two great athletes joining the surface with a squeaky, not completely depicting the nature of victory.
There is a group of helpful handicrafts behind each row, which gradually promote those things that matter. No handicraft was as important as a coach who did not know 30 months ago of cancer diagnosis would he live until today.
As he said, the situation was a tweak.
I had a bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they did surgery.
If they don't cut, it spreads everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
It will change your thinking.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third one was lucky that his treatment was able to begin outside the season at the beginning of 2014, when they caused as little disruption as possible - if it could ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department... 20, 30, 50 feet at a time, when they said a few steps would suffice.
That's how it started.
A rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first couple of thoughts were Williams, who had been nervous in the morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced commander of the Afghan command from the royal artillery, said: “I’ve been an emotional peace this week, which may be a little overreacted, but this means so much to me.
It just emphasizes how important this is to me, how hard it is for me and Helen, and Robin, too, we have worked.
It's been three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so he owes great thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost competition for five years.
The couple set a tough rhythm that their competitors didn't meet.
Even at the last 500 metres, when New Zealand and Danish teams started to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in the warehouse.
We were very close in a moment.
Helen screamed in the process, stay in the process.
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not try to do anything special.
We didn't look for fireworks today, we're just trying to win a good fight and a race, and that's what we did.
A couple wait a year before deciding about their future.
Glover will be attending the wedding next month when she gets married to TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say that this would be my last competition.
It would have put too much pressure on me.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
This feels so much better, he said.
Iceland is changing the government of Panama leaks
Iceland will hold premature parliamentary elections in October, which were already demanded by protesters who were angry with Panama data leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed a number of Islamic politicians’ evasion of taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlagsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for protesters.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to organize new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election has now been decided on 29 October.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the last-day rage of the people affects the autumn election result.
In June, the presidential elections clearly saw criticism of the rulers, and Gudni Johannesson was elected as president from outside the policy.
Trump said he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of Isis.
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his last speech.
He said he was sarcastically claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder and candidate for the establishment of the Hillary Clinton organization.
The Democratic Party was angry with speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
As commander of the army, you should never let anyone fall down like that, Clinton's tweet.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned Muslim favorite to cover the use of burkini swimwear on the bathing beaches, for example, the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to beaches and swimming for anyone who does not have a good way and a swimming suit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear, which largely express religious connections, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds of people were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two men connected to Isis attacked the church in Northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of swimming water in the Oulu region passed through the Seula - Püykösjärvi blue cementation
Water samples taken from the official bathing sites of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
There has been a blue fibrillation only on the beach of Lake Püykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, Oulu’s environmental action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing sites in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the coast of Meriniemi, the levels of E.coli and enterococobacteria from all bathing areas were below the limits of the measures adopted in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The water content of the seaniemi bathing area E.coli and enterocococ was confirmed on Wednesday, when the presence of bacteria had fallen below the limits of the measure.
The blue cement found on the bathing beach of Lake Püykösjärvi is not yet unsaturated, but in favourable circumstances the situation can quickly turn into a blue-grained flower, where the water surface is formed from a blue-green bed.
The environmental action follows the situation with enhanced inspections.
If the blue fibrillation turns into a blue cap, it will also be reported separately on the bathing board.
See the results of bathing water samples here.
Leadership: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
Forest reduction is one of the tax changes in the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance for the next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction that would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generation of forest farms.
The Ministry of Finance has four objectives: to promote the generation of forest farms, to increase the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of the forest farm and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote an entrepreneurial forest economy.
The forest owner would reduce the clean capital result of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool that promotes the generation of forest farms is good, comments by Juha Hakkarainen, the Director of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, it is important to find a critical tax change proposal.
Forest reduction is a task of the clean capital result of the forest owner.
It is a capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
According to MKK and Hakkarainen, the effect of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the sales result of the tree.
The VM proposal is based on a reduction in the clean capital income of forestry by preventing the loss of the capital income of forestry, which should be reduced in other taxation.
Such a person would get tax benefits even if he did not sell wood.
The model of calculation is very complex.
The average forest owner is unable to figure it out, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, the model concerns only a small part of forest owners.
The tax reduction limit linked to the forest's return value is EUR 40,000 in the proposal.
It has been pulled too high in the opinion of Hakkarainen.
As such, 82% of Finnish forest owners were cut off.
The model would have an impact of around 10% of the forest ownership division, he says.
The VM considers that the limit ensures the objective of increasing the holding.
In forest politics, forest donation has been carried out for decades by Hakkarainen.
Its background is the ageing of the forest owners.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
Powerful Raekuro surprised drivers in Himanga - two cars sank into the stream and bumped into each other
In the Kalajoki Himanga, a special chase took place on Friday morning.
According to the rescue facility, two consecutive times the car fell into a stream, after which the rear came running after the driver.
According to the fireman Harri Pühtiäja, a diversification of the stream is suspected to have been caused by a strong brutality.
In the back of time, there were two people in the car who were both transported to the hospital.
There is no more accurate knowledge of their injuries.
The driver of the car that was driving before was not injured.
The accident occurred on the highway 8 Himanga a few kilometers from Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings of the Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the incidence of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to match the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the efficacy of cancer medications may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.
Research results have been published on 4 August in a prestigious Nature Communications journal in the field of cell biology.
The Muhus family home death continues in the court, the prosecutor also calls for a murder sentence for another person.
The tree of the muhos family home death continues in the court for both convicted.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the death of the Muhoos family home.
The other received 8 years for 4 months from the killing and gross robbery of a young person, among other things.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment for murder and gross robbery as a young person.
The person convicted of the killing also received a judgment on the serious risk of road safety as a young person and the driving of a vehicle as a young person.
The judgment of the District Court was appealed by the prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who had been convicted of a more severe sentence.
The prosecutor calls for a lesser-criminal man to be convicted of murder as a young person for 12 years in prison.
They were at the time of the act in full understanding.
According to the case law, 17-year-olds killed a man who was a director of the child protection unit in the school home in July of last year.
A 17-year-old assassin was attacked by a director sitting on the couch of the living room, according to the judgment.
The director had come out of the boat and tolerated the young man in his room, when another young man hit him with a vacuum pipe.
Among other things, the director was strangled with wire, hit and kicked in the head.
According to a mental study, both convicted were at the time of the act in full understanding.
According to law, young people had been planning an escape from family homes at least since the previous day.
The ice shark is the longest vertebrate in the world, and only increases at the age of 156.
The world’s longest living vertebrate is the ice shark, according to a research published in the Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, like the ice shark floating around Greenland, the vault can live up to 400 years old.
The woman is only growing at the age of 156.
The ice age increases by only a centimetre per year.
Only one species of shellfish is known for longer live ice.
Scientists found out about their age with radiocarbons.
Because of the nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on this, researchers were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The oldest one was estimated to be 392 years old - though the throw in the direction or the other can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an Economic Visa - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need anything else in the world.
Even a third of all the tax revenues of the state would not be received if the change to the corporate tax imposed by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially with the richest tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax program as a revolutionary, presenting it on Monday in Detroit.
The company tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
It would be a huge amount, $1,000 a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39,6, after the reduction made by Trump.
The inheritance tax would be fully waived.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation of the business and of driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
The environmental standards decided by emergency intervention must be renewed and energy regulation broken down.
The Barack Obama Health Reform must be taken into consideration.
The administration must be appointed – experts rather than bureaucrats –
Trump said that trade policy is the biggest cause of the US problems.
Free trade agreements would be announced.
Imports from China would be subject to a 45 per cent penalty tax and 35 per cent of Mexico.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globality, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump’s America does not need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes to connect cities, American ships to control the sea, American steel to raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
By way of exception, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, even though well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump’s program leading the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced his own program early on Friday in Finland.
Attack from the past - People's News
The sea is arguably milling, but the real attack wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street, an accounting with the past can begin.
It is the core of Pedro Almodovar's new story.
Almodovar's previous steering work Travel lovers (2013) was a little fun and roskin-side satirical comedy, followed by the skin where I live (2011) the tops of the Spanish tour career.
Similarly, Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between these two works.
It’s a syndicated love, relationships, and family drama with a mother and daughter at the heart.
The story is a symple and we see it as a long backdrop.
Life seems to be modelled for a middle-aged named person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the later ads of a random encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) must always be in wonder until the end of the film.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Julieta once in her life stages for her grown-up daughter.
He begins the time before the birth of his daughter, from the time when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Juliet’s young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, will rise to the second female main part of the television show, the time between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta’s ageing has been treated in a way that can be considered a kitchen, but I would say that time with a slow and literal, one-off holiday.
For almodóvar films, often for such a characteristic ligament, humor is always a fair distance in Juliet.
It is a evenly played, controlled, place in places with good music and a very sad film with such ingredients for the elegance.
Instead, the typical visual colour brightness of the Spanish director is stored and so that it begins to put a little bit of silence in the eye as a purer as a functioning dramatic means of action.
Diseases, deaths, or other sudden loss of the film, but the surface remains one Korean.
This applies in particular to costumes: in the case of a named person, the inhabitants change from one scene to another, and the same applies to the visible ears.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main issue, i.e. the viruses of this scene, is not particularly improved.
The mechanically repeated impression is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has made the script on the basis of the three novels of the Canadian Alice Munron, awarded by Nobel in 2013.
Novellit has been published in the book of Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in the dialogue, resulting in a slightly smooth written literary filming.
Materials would have been emotionally more emotionally dramatic, so much big things - especially scalable guilt - the subject matter of the film is being dealt with.
Directed by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on the three novels of Alice Munro.
Main: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The movie first is 12.8.
The government is trying to vote - People's News
No new cuts will be made, cheap ministers, so that the basic Finns do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are made by a crisp shop.
There will be no new cuts.
The remaining four billion savings are sufficient.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (kok.) are convinced of the budgetary gap.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, since social security cuts were already decided in the spring framework.
Child welfare, state pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pensions Index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training cuts continue.
Gymnastics
Why are the ministers so hard to emphasize that there are no new cuts on them?
Because next year is the election year.
Locals will be held in April and will be the main hot label of the elections, not the gallops.
It has been seen before that the outcome of the municipal elections in different directions will ruin the government's mood for a long time.
However, the Gallupits say that the government party is waiting for a shrink loss, although the result of its previous election was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the basic Finns received 752 new mandates, the price of influence in the right government for most of them next spring.
The lifeline of the government of the three parties is in the interests of the basic Finnish people.
It has not taken long now, but more than half of the voters had the need for government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visit have become surface.
In the first place, new cuts will not be made – the fact that next year they will be made violently and, second, they will be tried to soften the impact that awaits the basic Finnish people.
Major cuts in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different - if the Sipila government is still up.
The government has set a target for the consolidation of debt in this parliamentary term, but the Petteri Orpo budget proposal will owe EUR 5.9 billion next year, more than this year.
After municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the electoral period and admit that the government is unable to follow its own program: debt is not folded or even slowed.
The other one has to stick to the program.
This means new cuts in the budget line for 2017.
The budget would be drawn at least close to the balance during 2018, and then in the spring, Parliamentary elections will receive what will come.
These measures do not allow for debt
It is quite clear that the current measures do not change the debt, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to ease the positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary-General Martti Hetemäki at the information conference prove it irresponsibly:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved overoptimistic, i.e. no veto aid from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not recently risen since the collapse in 2008, except in the context of a temporary recovery policy at the beginning of the 2010s.
In this decade, unemployment has increased by 35% and prolonged from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs €3 billion a year more than in 2008.
The current government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, debt recovery was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs about EUR 6 billion, which is practically fully covered by new debt.
This is the idea of the centre, meeting and the basic Finnishs of what is responsible.
Question: You want to leave a lot of tasks to the community.
Three out of four consider that the organisation of day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by KAKS - Municipality Development Foundation.
A large majority of the people also hold responsibility for the individual community, including libraries, culture, citizens’ studies, building supervision, high school education, and waste management.
On the other hand, the responsibility of the county is more clearly sought by county planning, special care, vocational training, universities of applied sciences and institution care for developing disabled people.
No tasks under the authority of the municipalities are intended to be transferred to the State.
Underage wheel jogging ran a run-back drive to end the police escape
A 16-year-old motorcycling driver ran a police party in Joensuu on Friday night at half a hour.
The police department tried to stop without the lights of the time of the motorcycle, but the young man went to drive the police to escape a fair speed.
The retreat continued on the Sonkaja beach, from which to Soronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle was driven out of the road.
After that, the young man left the runaway, but the faster-walked police ran into the fugitive.
The driver's blow test showed a 0.75 prom.
He also did not have a driver's license that would justify driving on a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the rock cargo fell into the stream.
The truck in the rock cargo fell into the stream at the Kavijärvi on Thursday at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had driven to the left on the map in the corner of the road and fell on its side in the stream.
The rescue facility took the injured driver out of the broken truck through the door that was left above, together with rescue helicopter personnel and emergency attendants.
Lifting the vehicle was the responsibility of the car owner.
The lost truck poured hydraulic oil on the road, which was absorbed by the rescue facility.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon at the Air River
The 87-year-old woman has been missing in Lahtilä, Lahtilä, South Ostrobothnia since the afternoon.
Police are looking for about 165 centimetres of long, slimy and gentle women with white jaws under hair.
The observations and tips on lost movements are requested to call the North State Situation Centre’s reference number 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - look at the photo gallery of the damage to Parafest
Parafest festival tents poured into the espionage flow caused massive damage.
The President of the Parafestus of Joensuu, Mr Pippuri, estimates that the festival will be economically accessible to its feet, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of the Parafest Kalle Salonen appeared on Friday night at the end of the tower.
On Saturday, the program will continue with presentations held at the city theater premises starting at 13.
The Art Centre in Ahjo is the Parafest exhibition 13-15.
The program will be planned.
The escalating flow occurs in a thunderstorm when rainwater and its weight trigger the descending air flow.
The changes in the water shape of the water in the water cloud are binding on heat, and therefore the descending air is cooling and its speed is accelerating towards the ground.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that escalating flows occur in Finland during several summers.
It is difficult to predict the route of escalating flows.
The espionage was hit by Parafest at the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people were mildly offended.
There was one child who was transported to a mildly injured post-treatment group.
Air pollution is ageing Londonians
According to the study, the skin of the Londons is getting older faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The British study tells us about the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic tiny particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many people with a retirement age is two and a half years older than the age group living in rural areas.
Skin-earning tiny particles are a very good dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, die from nearly 9 500 Londons every year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those Londoners who walk on their way to work in close proximity to the crowded streets.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example with different masks, but a more practical solution is recommended for regular skin cleaning.
Tractor's brakes betrayed the man standing in front of you.
The man had moved stones in his yard on the tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the tractor's brakes betrayed and the tractor fell on the man.
The man did not fall under it, but the tractor was forced to carry him to the Central Hospital as seriously injured by further studies.
The tractor couldn’t get any further, because it ran into the stones in front of him.
Reunition of the latest power for the future season
The riverside League Riento, which is playing in the World Cup, is starting in October from a better starting point than a man's memory.
The team has been together for three weeks.
The single text is more secure than in the previous seasons, when the series’s life has been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisa, who continues to be the chief coach of the race, calls the new team for an attempt and unity.
Fred Musoni begins his second season in Rienus.
The new faces are the 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.

Garchet is a passer, the Brazilian has a total of 198 cents.
Josban, Kataja and Jokipoki to the U.S. National Team
Anne JPampinen has played almost all the Salibandy World Championships since 2003.
Now, in Tampere, there are already 6th races, only 2013 remained in the middle of Canada after being better in North America.
I was working in Turku and playing at the women's club when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Salibandy country team.
I was interested and here I am, Jpartnernen, 48, says.
It was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, JPampinen reached the University of Joensuu to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, it wasn't like the kind that was played at the SM level.
It was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoj, ice hockey in the SM series, Jämpinen remembers.
The JP partner played the Salibandy SM series during the 1991-92 season, followed by three in Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the club A-girls in the championship.
Women’s SM series career peaked in 1995.
In total, JPampinen played in the women's SM series through 10, with a balance of 169 in the game 51+34=85.
The latest SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Vänänen were named for the country team
The Joensuu Salibandy Society Josban grew up in Perttu Puska and the enocentred Tatu Vänänen was selected for the Finnish team of countries playing in the Czech Brnon EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In Helsinki, 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played this before six men's land matches, where he has gained a total score of 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defender of the Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Vänänen, has recovered from the traveling wound and is part of the country team’s standard fleet with 117 experiences of land match.
The country team was also named ‘Mika Kohonen’, the co-founder of the Seinjoki Players, who was seen in the Finnish shirt for the last time in the World Cup last December.
The main coach of the Salibandy County team is Petri Kettunen, a continentalist.
Beach volley Theatre Essi Hasun's circle closes to Kouvola - SM gold is missing from the award cabinet
Essi Hasu is finishing as a beach volley player at least after a temporary period.
Beach volleyy Finnish Championships will be settled on a weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, medals will be played in both adult and young series.
In co-operation with the Kouvola Airballs and the Finnish Aviation Balloon Association, six best pairs of each series of rankings will be eligible for the SM final tournament.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Elimäe NMKY by Essi Hasu, who has been part of the Finnish beach volley peaks for several years.
Today, Hasu, living in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to watch this weekend.
I'm sure Pesisstadion will have a great arena.
I haven’t played in adult series very often in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in final home angles, Hasu tunnel.
The Kouvola area set fire to Hasun's high sport and gave good cookies to a fine hobby.
There are very memories of childhood.
I started the volleyball at the age of nine in Elimäe's NMKY's E-girls.
The main thing is too big a game shirt in mind, knee protectors in the ankles, as well as huge backs and choreographs after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small area, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group’s shared spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All families were strongly involved - the father of the teammater coached us and our mother was the president of the club for a long time.
At the time of June, Essi Hasulle beach volley was a natural choice of species for the counterweight of the internal air balloon.
There has been a song on the beach since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to the junior SM tour, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream will be realized when Hasu plays on the weekend together with Pixemäki Annina Parkkinen in the SM-Finals.
The goal of the second-ranked two after Riikka Lehtinen and Taru Lahti in the tournament is clear.
A realistic goal is to have a medal.
We still lack SM gold from the award cabinet, Hasu throws me with dignity.
The event of the weekend in Kouvola may be in front of the last known audience of Hasulle.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civil work.
The international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toes are put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
The clash flow poured tents in the event of disabled people in Joensuu, the great disaster was near

There was a show going on in one of the big tents.
Two tents were smaller.
The accident occurred on Friday at 17:00.
Markus Viitaniemi, a police officer interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that there were substances in the situation of great unhappiness.
According to the newspaper, the sequel to the event is at stake.

Solomon Koli went to be an agricultural entrepreneur.
As an entrepreneur, agriculture means risk-taking, sweat and strength.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in the countryside as well.
Koli started two years ago with her little brother, Valtteri Koli, acting as a successor to their home.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural operator meant borrowing and ordering an increase so that bread could come out of the hands of agriculture.
This has been my thing since my little boy.
I’ve always been happy with the farm, and now that I’ve started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it should be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a jet, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
However, I really went along with the project and I’ve been fully involved in it, Solomon’s Koli says and adds that he would not have done it if he didn’t believe in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would turn to good.
The aim of Solomon Koli, which is growing muscle cars, is to invest in its even bigger navet.
The work has produced the result, as Solomon Koli has chosen to be among the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of the Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a potential victory.
He will be able to vote on the website until 21 August.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest number of years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero after last October, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
The annual average inflation measured by the cost of living index was -0.8 % in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) when compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
In July 2016, the cost of living index was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate at the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2%, and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, the price of the following consumer goods increased: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, economics and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level with the previous month in the case of alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's anime - power is appreciated as an Asian Cup
Snapchat says anime has been the source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to edit reality and identify the way they play, which are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into an anaks, dogs, or characters that would suit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Birds are simple, face-to-face tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfiees per day.
All misconceptions quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have been previously criticized by accusations that the application advertises blackface or black mask or favors bleached skin color as a beauty trick.
So when Snapchat advertised to some users this week, a lens that gave them a line of eyes, a line of teeth and a sticky cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people – a yellow face.
And they wonder if these repeated nomics could be a sign of the company’s greater problem in terms of diversity.
News and misbelief spread on a large Wednesday with reports from The Vergen and Motherboard, the day later Snapchat said that he had abolished the feature.
The company offered an explanation: Linssi was meant to be a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But for those who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others banned anime comparison.
Grace Sparapan, a Korean-American art student, whose tweeted photos were widely distributed, said in his email that the lens was at least offensive and uncomfortable.
He added, “It is difficult to argue against a comparison that is adjacent to a gross Asian caricature and filter strengths.”
It shows that the filter is not only yellow, but yellowed into extreme defamation.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be stuck in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all stand in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge, racially older, diverse youth audience may mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates a image that offends the user, it's much harder for these guys to be unnoticed.
On Thursday, Zhu, Head of Product and Engineer working for Medium, decided to remove their Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and telephone interviews, he said he believed that race-related disputes reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat's pay practices.
Zhu mainly criticized the white male leadership and decided to write on hashtag #DelateSnapchat (#BustaSnapchat)
“Whether they do not have a wide range of skin color representations in their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions like this, the Chinese American Zhu said, “or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak directly.”
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint which Snapchat has largely failed to respond to.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, indicating its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss his staff with a breeder, but the representative said the company hired the recruiter to focus on the under-represented populations and to pursue internal integration efforts.
Zhu said that he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding: \"Is it true that they need more users like us to say that this is not okay?
According to the Congress panel, military officials have misinterpreted Isis intelligence data
In a report published on Thursday, the Congress Panel said that the U.S. military headquarters had modified intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against the ISIS than was justified by the events on the ground.
The Interim Review Report of the Working Group on the Defence Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Fund Sub-Committee found a widespread dissatisfaction among the main intelligence analysts, who said that the executives were thumbing their assessment of the American efforts to win the Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the head of the armed military area in Florida Tampa, which monitors U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The data generated by the higher-value Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of the U.S. anti-terrorist efforts than the facts on the ground. They were generally more positive than the analyses produced by other factors in the intelligence community, the report was said in the press release.
“Centcom’s events are impossible to accept – in the war of our fighters, when bad analysis is presented to high-ranking decision-makers, Mr. Ken Calvert, California Republican,” he said.
The failures of Centcom's management reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the constant problems in the descriptions and analysis of the capital, the U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the high-value administrative authorities of the Obama administration would have ordered reports to be fraudulent, it describes the analysts knowing that Centcom’s leaders would have put pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
“For the first half of 2015, many press releases, opinions and certificates for Congress were much more positive than the events themselves,” the report said.
The Centcom authority, for example, publicly stated that a major attack on the return of Mosulin could even begin as early as in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in Isis's possession.
\"After months of research, this is very clear,\" said Mike Pompeo, the Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top intelligence executives in the U.S. military military area were manipulatively manipulating the intelligence from the headquarters in order to reduce the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created a working group after hearing that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence data from the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday follows more extensive results when the investigation is ongoing.
The Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defence has started an additional investigation into Centcom's investigation.
On Thursday, the Democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee of the House published their own findings, which were consistent with the conclusions of some Republican working groups.
Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a process of dissatisfied intelligence between ISIS and Iraq's security forces, represented by Adam B. Schiff, the committee's leader, said in the opinion.
According to Schiff, this process - extended the publication of intelligences - undermined the mood among analysts and did not give enough space for different perspectives.
Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find evidence that the White House would have tried to pressure the Centcom analysts to reconcile their conclusions with a pre-set or political narrative.
The Daily Beast reports on the preliminary results of the survey of the Congress on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon supervisor has started an investigation after the Centcom analyst complaints.
Commander Patrick Evans, the Pentagon representative, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the Congress report as long as the study of the Oversight is ongoing.
But he said that \"experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security.
The study has other follow-up consequences than just the question of whether the US-led bombing activities in Iraq and Syria are successful (such as a growing number of defence authorities now claim).
Last year’s charges questioned how much President Obama can rely on the capital to provide honest assessments of the war on Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
The criticism of the Islamic State’s inquiry reflects a decade’s background debate when Centcom’s intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a study article saying that despite the objections of several analysts, President George W. Bush’s administration supported a small military force in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion in the Islamic State's intelligence.
According to the authorities last year, the Hooker Group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, the air strikes against the refineries ruled by the Islamic State had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy, as it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters.
The Centcom Bridge Commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate to be a more positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States will win the fourth consecutive round in women's country hockey by organising an interdependence with the UK
The day after he had scored three goals for the team winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam made on Thursday for the U.S. women's ground hockey team the first two goals of the American winning India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn’t sure if he had done the same before.
\"I have no idea,\" he said.
“I’m not really the kind of person who keeps a book about his paintings.
But he knows this: Americans are in 4-0 situations in the Olympics and they share their group first place with the UK, which was still unbeatable after winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
The UK and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have survived the quarter, and this game will decide who will be the first and who will be the second in their six teams.
The first place was to avoid a strong Dutch, second-group leader, a little longer in the beginning of the quarter-finals.
Whatever the end of the game on Saturday, Americans have awakened their amazing success here, four years after they left the London Olympics for the last 12 teams.
Bam was in that team.
He grew up in the Blue Bell in Pennsylvania and picked up the groundckeyman in his hands for the first time at the age of 3 (i.e. his parents, their twin sister, played in Drexel), related to the country team at the age of 16, when he became the youngest player of all time.
He was not involved in the 2008 Olympics because he failed to join the final player list.
In 2012, nothing went on for him and his teammates.
The following year, the Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
\"Culture change, mental change, physical change,\" Bam said.
We didn’t have the same kind of work in London as we do now.
We've made a full translation.
On Thursday night, Bam began to paint the first half-time painting near the root of the goal.
India had come to the game in the air with no victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the situation in 1-0s until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball to the left of the field for a long time, then went to the middle and threw the ball into the paint, taking the Americans to the 2-0 wire.
Melissa Gonzalez added a quarter of a quarter in the middle of the final goal.
This zero game was the first American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs to win one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
\"We now have a good situation,\" Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
Trampoliin's Peace in the Olympics
Wherever you are, whatever the time is, the Olympics are running.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a continuous and inevitable message of fierce competition and effort.
It is as if the Olympics themselves were a flaming message capsule, which is transmitted from the archer to the swimmer and the gymnastic to the triathlonist.
It is impossible to put on TV, read a newspaper, or listen to a conversation with a guest in the queue of the cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then it's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first time in the Olympics and the future heart crusher with a smiler, could well be one of the names of everyone known to be presented at the best viewing time and supported by sponsorship agreements and by good mind television ads - if he were a swimmer, a gymnastic or even a swordman.
But the Dooley, 28 of California's Lake Forest, competes with the Olympic gold in Trampoline.
The Olympics do not illuminate all species as much.
Far from the middle, partly in the shadow, are the species that not all generally accept: air pistol ammo, bowball, taekwondo.
We always have a broom, long live it.
But if I can make a reasonable number of my special favors, I would like to draw attention to the charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been a type of Olympic since 2000, when it made its first appearance in Sydney's races, its presence has been so few in the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic species at all.
This can be a territorial ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete has never progressed to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russian usually share male, Chinese and Canadian women medals.
This year, Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie McLenna defend their gold medals in London.
Trampoliin, however, is accompanied by a certain charm of the underworlder, partly because it sounds better suited to the clown school than to the Olympics.
Here I have to admit that I'm not an expert, I'm just an airless fan.
There are opportunities for fun in the species, as is noted by the coloring of the endless bombs of drawing filters, but it also has the sweetness of gymnastics and swimming jumps, two species that basically combine in it.
The word “trampoline” comes from the Spanish word El trampoline, which means a pop board.
The champions of the championship jump with a giant trampoline to a height of up to 30 feet, and they have to carry out swinging business series (versions, skills and volleys) and finally land on their feet.
According to the official Olympics program, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and flight time.
In Rio, 32 athletes compete in 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The general direction of the Olympics is directly ahead.
The medallians need to go to the gold in search of longer, faster, up and over - sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They do not only hunt the finish line or start-ups, but also, in television news, the other offensive border: the world record or the Olympics.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical, and it can even get into the tears of the viewer.
But that’s also the reason why watching races can be a little exhausting.
Trampoline offers a resting moment here.
Trampoline's direction is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The racer rises to the new rise, looking weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then up effortlessly again.
Of course, this does not affect competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no fierce rush towards the end, no jumps to distance, only a dream of time and gravity, a melting interruption.
It's as close to the zen state as the Olympics can get.
Women's Championships and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon at 13am (ET), men's races will also come on Saturday at 13.00pm.
NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon software as of 14 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympics, they offer a quiet, charming moment, which most likely does not notice in the general chaos.
And if awareness is achieved only by providing male athletes to be starred and objective (such as the US men's fighters recently suggested The Wall Street Journal), Dooley just expects a delicious new fanship.
\"The generation shows its opinion: Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
The protesters who call for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Eyewitnessers say that dozens of protesters have been shot to death in meetings with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the last decade, it has been one of the most stable African countries, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country as it spreads to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people attacked the streets, requiring a radical political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was inoperable.
The witness said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
The broadcasts, recorded in protests, which are believed to be at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, show how the security authorities beat young people while they were forced to stand against the wall.
The United Nations General Court of Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“Keeping this country together was always difficult, and in the future it will be even more difficult,” Rashid Abdi, a project manager of the Horn of Africa, said in the International Crisis Group study group.
Ethiopia, after Nigeria, is the second most populous country in Africa, and the Western countries appreciate its stability.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians in the fight against the terrorist threat of the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western assistance.
The Ethiopian economy has grown at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital of Addis Ababa has even a new train for business travelers.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not, however, been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have been constantly talking about government oppression, the opposition of the country has been limited, and dissidents have been silenced effectively.
Many have been expelled from the country, captured, killed or driven far to the desert.
But this could be changing.
“If you suppress people, and they have no choice but to show their mind, this is what will happen,” Seyoum Teshomee, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
All young people show their minds.
One generation shows its mind.
Complaints are diverse and cover all the disciplines of the coalition that governs land use.
The party with its allies after a lot of critical elections last year had a last position to hold the opposition, and now it holds all the seats of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions at the border against Eritrea are growing. The battle along this tight and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less destroyed over the past few years, can try to use the dwindling for good and re-installed.
Numerous factors explain why the bitter emotions are now going to explode after the fall of the surface of the years.
The first seems to be seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media when the cheaper smartphones have become more common and the internet service has improved.
Even though the government would close access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still message through the hidden network servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, oromes and amhara, are better able to work with each other.
Oromes and amharans are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Ampharas, who come to Ethiopia mainly from the Christian highlands, succeeded in politics and business using orphans, many of which are Muslims and who live on the alps.
But this is changing, too.
\"We're on our way to organizing a single umbrella,\" said Mulatu Gemechu.
The greatest demonstrations have been in the Amara and Orome regions.
Many Amharans and Oromes think that Ethiopia is unfairly controlled by the tigre people. The population covers about 6% of the population and dominates the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawin.
Meles, former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and to use secret ambassadors to make opponents unhappy.
\"There is no basic sense like that,\" the conflict analyst Abdi said.
The new prime minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was home to the North-Etiopia tigre area, Haiemaram is from the south.
Analysts say that security services controlled by tigers do not trust him.
Many people are afraid that this can lead to increased bleeding.
The last time Ethiopia was in the power of such a blow in 2005, when thousands of people showed their minds about the elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have the government first fluttered and then robbed them.
In the wake of an effective attack, many protesters died, though less than in the last few months, and that period of restlessness passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new work travel train, and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously, this has not stopped the internal government of Ethiopia from overcoming its contempt.
And now it starts to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar attacked tiger-owned companies, and the hatred against tigers becomes more and more common in social media.
Analysts say protests place the United States and other Western allies in a cluttering position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for flying flights to Somalia, although it recently said it closed this base.
Although Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want their allies in the unstable region to collapse.
\"This,\" Abdi said, \"there is a real balance,\"
Donald Trump explains Obama's basic-Isis claim to be \"sarchism\".
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress his last campaign on Friday, claiming that he wasn’t serious when this week he was a number of times inspired that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founders of the Islamic State’s terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who have worked hard to defend him during the stormy period, in a difficult position in which they must explain the remarks he does not necessarily mean.
After a tip at the Wednesday campaign meeting, Trump said the same more and more exciting at Thursday’s interviews in which he encouraged him to say that President and Clinton created Isis.
Early on Friday morning, Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The publication was a complete translation of the previous day, when Trump said he was serious about the accusation in several interviews.
When the Conservative radio driver Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump decorate his remarks by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took this to his ears.
The last review storm comes in a situation where Trump has tried to refocus his campaign in the midst of the results of the polls that fall into the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
I'm running back to Twitter, he warned Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and he considered the speech boring.
Trump used sarcasm.
Later in July, when he met a wide-ranging review, he suggested that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying that I am sarcastic.
The approach allows Trump to go back to the boundaries of political speech and then return if necessary.
“I think it’s a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He sees how they work and then “explain” in the direction or in the other, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is keen on his opinions and knows that they are vague enough to filter them through several different lenses.
Instead of reducing his speech to a large audience, Trump has been even more smug in recent days when his popularity has continued to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, published on Friday, showed that Trump is a major pick-up on Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump, as a rule, is trying to avoid making excuses about the provocative things he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
During his ever closer examination of the presidential election campaign in the last few months, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies to become uncomfortable, in which they must publicly support him, regardless of how provocative his remarks are.
The former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, is one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, had a lot of trouble defending the candidate at CNN’s interview on Thursday.
\"I believe that his words have real, political comments,\" Giulian said, \"as he was asked about the reality of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton set up an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, the small organization he called amateur, totally wrong, and that is why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to claim that the Obama government, where Clinton worked as a foreign minister, allows Isis to get worse because it failed to effectively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania Friday meetings, Trump continued to attack on Twitter towards the newsmedia, which cooled him every word and are biased against him.
He mocked, pathetic, television experts who were trying to make him clear, saying, \"They can't do it.
Some Democrats mocked Trump’s excuse for a new evidence that he was an inappropriate president.
Previously closed cafe returns to GreenPoint
Verb Cafe was a thin, just a cash-acceptable place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but which offered a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the street corner of Bedford Avenue was too expensive for it.
A business that replaced Verbin in summer 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the form of a cup cake.
It was the last loss by the locals in the middle-class-sucking city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBG is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap shop.
But if New York is a change, it is also a re-invention.
In November, the Elevated Verb opened up to GreenPoint, under a mile of its original location.
There is a wifi in the new Verb and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff still have the same and there is the same inexhaustible atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verbi is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe, which is the owner and CEO of the new location.
He started in Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When the client offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it too.
He brought new ingredients.
On the menu you can find bacon eggs cheese bread, and the coatings offer, for example, caps and browned onion.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
Coffee is no longer served, but fresh juices are made there.
In nine months, Rodriguez said he saw a steady stream of old carrier customers.
\"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers,\" he said.
One last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and visited Verb regularly.
After moving to GreenPoint, he walked to the cafe.
He says that after Verb's shut down, he gave up the coffee drink for a while.
“I understood that I enjoyed Verb’s coffee and culture,” he said.
Now he has returned to the coffee, although that day he ordered a chai drink instead of his regular ice coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been in Verb since 2003.
He used to work there and always made the same order.
“Every day, more than seven, on a regular basis, I went in, and they were making a tasty bagel with a butter,” he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients on the menu.
Today, Rosenthal continues to make his usual order, but sometimes due to the variation, he will order a tasty bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he's not wearing a sauna for a soap shop that took over old spaces.
In fact, Soap Cherie’s owners offered to prepare Verb for a special soap that would be used as an ingredient for the cold-rolled coffee in the café.
“I think we can still take the offer,” Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of GreenPoint have also accepted the café.
One of these new customers turned the menu into a Pole, and Rodriguez said he was planning to set it up soon to get a new neighbor to feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice store wants to bottle and sell cold coffee.
It is possible that the cafe expands into a nearby building.
For many customers, it’s enough that they get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a carrier and said it was harmless when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said that he felt like he had come home walking inside and ordering coffee.
“I needed to smell it,” he said.
A Square Meal: Degrading Food
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his office room.
President Roosevelt liked the sophisticated Fifth Avenue food, such as the goose mascara, and Maryland's sorority.
On that day, his diet was more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato sauce and dessert from the skeleton.
“It was an expression of culinary solidarity for people suffering,” Jane Ziegelman said.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.
The Brooklyn Heights couple is food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about his life at the Lower East Side apartment house through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By pointing out some of their own culinary solidarity, they meet a journalist for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, refined lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been operating since 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered fresh cheese olive bread, and Coe, 57, took a dose with turkey, potatoes and vegetables.
When the journalist ordered a meat crush, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss the eating of the sheep season.
“The noises were very popular,” Ziegelman said.
There was peanut crush, liver breaker, baked beans.
They were made from the manufacturing material and some of the cheap ingredients that continued the actual manufacturing material.
Imagine your cancer so much peanuts that they make up your dinner.
Coe irritately.
\"It must have felt like a pencil in the stomach,\" he said.
In the years before the recession, on American tables, especially in the countryside, there was like eating-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a.
Women's groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pies were served with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. The Square Meal book crowned the way the nation survived from the sudden fact that it was no longer a land of abundance.
At that time, food became a major, disturbing topic for Americans, Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
A new, affordable diet was one: Mysterial dishes, such as jams and boxes, became the main food, and the box was a great way to use food stars, said Ziegelman, because the chefs could hide less attractive ingredients under a cream sauce layer.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
The meat, which had been at the center of American meals for years, became a cost-effectively dosed luxury product.
Special ingredients were tried with calorie and nutritional content more important than taste or even healthy reason in the kitchen.
When researching a book containing recipes, Ziegelman prepared a type of food of the era where fried onions were filled with peanuts.
“It wasn’t a popular addition to the dinner table,” Coe said.
Ziegelman said: “It was unreal.
The peanut butter is in no way suitable for baked onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office for Home Affairs in 1923-1943, directed the country’s eating habits more than ever before or after.
In the newspapers and magazines of publications, they encouraged women to become budgeters, and to respond to the challenge of transforming unsuspected spagetts and carrots into tasty doses.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical flavors.
Particularly tasty are the stories of the government's reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, let me eat your cake weapon.
At the same time, when he publicly praised his childhood with a simple, iowaan ground food, he ate as a sophisticated millionaire who had become him.
\"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce,\" Coe said.
He ate in a nearly cute dining room on his head.
He was great outside of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, would have encouraged him to be an example in his own stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that, not only served as one of Washington’s most generous, but also as the most intricate food made in Washington.
Many of the sheep-time eating methods were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Traditionally, our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they gained a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother, for example, how she could not throw away food.
\"He was really afraid of wasting food,\" Coe said.
Ziegelman remembers: “He even sick people.
There was a wind attack.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe took out the dessert they had prepared at home: the bone marrow food that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
\"It's called bone foam,\" Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give a name for modest recipes.
There was no whipped cream, only bone, a little flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone sank their spoons unwittingly into their sticky, brown vester.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe said it once and for all.
As a positive budgeter, he told his wife: “A little bit of bitten German nuts could help.
Gilead will be compensated for by attorneys in the Battle against Merck for hepatitis C patent
The U.S. Court of Appeal has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the legal costs incurred by him in the case of the hepatitis C patient against Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million in payments for their breach of two Merck patents that joined the successful Gilead medications Sovald and Harvin. This release followed when an American judge found Merck's abuse, including false oath and other ethical practices.
In the judgment of Thursday, U.S. Wedding Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to be released from compensation for which it was brought against the action.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines, which can significantly improve over 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other in the courts of the owners of the laboratory work on the basis of sofosbuvir.
The U.S. troops say that they have fully conquered Manbij, who is controlled by Isis.
The U.S.-based forces have taken control of the Turkish border since the last remaining Isis fighters left the city, the group’s representative said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last combat team hidden in the city left there.
The troops had released more than 2,000 Svilipant prisoners, which the fighters considered captives, of Sharfan Darwish SDF's ally, Manbij's military council, told Reuters.
\"We're in full control now, but we've started to investigate it,\" he told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2% of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax declaration showing that the income of the Democratic candidate and his spouse in that year was $10.75 million, and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015 Clinton donated a million dollars to charity organizations, mainly Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned almost $5.3 million in speaker compensation, and the former foreign minister announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster in his book, which reported his career in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice president, Senator Tim Caine Virginia, his wife Anne Holton, published a 10-year tax return.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
\"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine set a measure of economic transparency,\" Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmier said in a statement.
As a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
As usual, US presidential candidates publish their tax returns, even though the law does not oblige them to do so.
New York Businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax administration’s audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
\"Ian Sams, a Clinton campaign assistant, said on Twitter, when he published a link to the Democratic Candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits were ready.
Trump's critics, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues in 2012, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his contributions to charity, his transactions and numerous other links, such as Russia.
Clinton has infected the problem of publishing a web video on Friday, bringing out visible Republicans who call on Trump to publish their taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every candidate for president of the past decades has done: published his tax returns,” he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times’s business colonialist borrowed many tax agents and accountants on Friday, who said that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named by a billionaire investor Warren Buffett to ensure that more than one million dollars per year would pay at least 30% of the taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Clinton's meeting in Omaha last week at Buffett, which is located in Berkshire Hathaway, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Mr. Buffett said he also had an audit of the tax government, and that Trump did not - be afraid - the tax collection agency, but voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the actual federal tax rate of the Clintons in Chappaqua, New York, was around 32% between 2007 and 2014, and their real combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
Clinton's tax return in 2015 showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a cheap, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton announced $190,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and seals enhance the protection of Tanzania's elephants
Nature defenders in Tanzania use an unusual way to prevent elephants from walking to human settlements - they throw animals in chili powder-filled condoms.
The work has proved effective, and many years ago, the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the American Nature Conservancy, has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in Northern Tanzania villages to use nonviolent four-step ways of protecting homes and hundreds of animals without being injured.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the world’s elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since we developed tools, we have seen a change of attitude in these communities, and they are now much more confident about the fact that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them,” said Damian Bell, CEO of Honeygues.
The first two steps will include the demonstration of an intruding elephant with a flashlight and the call of a horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, we'll throw the so-called chili cloud.
The condom is filled with chili powder and soil mixture, as well as in bulk, after which the condom is wrapped up so that only the ignition wire remains visible.
When the condom is lit, it bursts into a burrow and crushs chili powder dust into the air.
One drink is usually enough to send the elephant in the other direction.
The last means is the trigger that shoots the Roman candle in the air. Ilotulite produces a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticized a Berlin hotel that removed Israel's direct number at the request of Arabs
The French, Jewish-style filmmaker, after the media storm was revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli direction number. According to the employee, this is due to the requests from the Arabs.
Claude Lanzmann, a film from the Holocaust documentary, Claude Lanzmann, was frustrated at the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel, writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay at Lanzmann, he was able to find Israel in the country's country-specific list of hotels offered by the hotel.
However, the country is not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016, in Berlin, the new capital city of Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
On the other hand, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own phone center.
When looking for an explanation, the filmmaker took a speech at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer from there was a shock to him.
The hotel’s recipeist said it was a “Decided Decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels”
The reason behind the decision was even more shocking in the filmmaker.
“The vast majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel’s direct number,” the employee said, according to Lanzmann.
Israeli Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case a big mistake, Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
“We were terrified and shocked because of the incident.
It is already a great mistake in itself.
But even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need explanations.
We're waiting for the hotel to draw the right conclusions, the official said.
The incident produced quite a response online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski hotel simply gave up – to the alleged demands of the Arabs.
“Hävetsätsä, a second publication, noted that a hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street is standing near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called it uncontrollable, and asked for an apology from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel.
“It is clear that Israel has never been included in the quick selection list, according to the Suddeutche Zeitung, the representative of Kempinski said.
It adds that the heading number has now been added.
Police used cynic gas and rubber bags against Brazilian students
On Thursday, students joined with the police in the city of Sao Paulo in Brazil, when students gathered to demonstrate their views on the reform of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubbers against protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to break down the student team, leading to police using rubber bags and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express the horror of plans.
According to President Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, less than 100 public schools would be closed and 300 000 students would be re-invested to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing to the walls of the temporary president Michel Temer's graffiti.
This last demonstration took place only days after the protestors launched as a group to support President Dlame Rousseff, arrested for office in the vote of the Senate of the country.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran is suddenly increasing 71%
Since the abolition of the packages, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent since the previous year, according to the Russian Ambassador Leva Dzhagaryan.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were abolished, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in transactions in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing links to Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
\"Of course, Iran's two-way cooperation is one of the main objectives of trade expansion,\" Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to 2015, with a total of $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5%, with a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to $158 million.
\"The growth of the van was achieved by the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons,\" the Ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representative in Iran granted approximately 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was among the 20 most tourists in Russia for the first time.
“It is safe to say that the record of last year’s Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, very few Russians visit Iran, whose ambassador hopes to change.
“I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. They have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he said.
Scotti Callum Skinner hit the goal of the British on a cycling gold.
Scotland's Callum Skinner honoured the men's team prince at Rio's cycling stadium last night, when the British team's trio defended its championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role where his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy was restored, the legend was proud of the young man when he came to the goal by taking the victory from the New Zealand team.
Britain took the shock win four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick when they were modestly ranked the sixth to the March race in the World Championships in London, even though Hoy has since decided to compete.
The problem between the Beijing and London races was the replacement of a special messenger Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time when Hindus appeared.
Hoy's ending also created a vacuum that Kian Emad and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man from which British trainers held in front of the Scottish potential now perceived.
Hindles, Kenny, who won the championship four years ago with Hoy, and Skinner did the Olympic show in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British third won a double fight for gold.
After his round, Hindes was very close to him, but Kenny took a blow to the team, and Skinner caught it.
The strategic change was a major part of the change in shape, and included the driving of Hindus with a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to stick to the pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert, and drew the attention of Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes when they entered the prize.
23-year-old glasgowlainen Skinner said: “Warning is flattering.
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
In the final, we won the Olympics and won the world champions.
It was incredible all the time.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindus admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments, and the British competitors have not complained.
This time there was no such problem with overpower.
He said, “It felt like he was in London when he had so many British tickets on his feet.
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply great.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven out of ten cycling species in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we will be expected to be successful for five days on a cycling stadium.
On the basis of the good news shown by Kenny, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's male, winning three Olympic gold in one of the Olympics.
It would mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, has also been born on March 23 (which is apparently the holy day of British sport, which is also Steve Redgraven, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister's birthday) - the total number of medals would rise to six gold and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny will compete next in the sprint, which starts today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I just enjoyed this one.
The team competition is always the best.
It's won together with friends.
To win alone is to be honest:
Hindus said, “If he wins two gold medals, he should be given the value of the knight.
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owen Doull were the fastest four-person, four-mile team hit.
Their time was 3:51:943.
In London, the world record of gold won in 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the times when the officials invited him to the length measurement.
In a similar women's race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Milngavinen Katie Archibald, at the end of the world record at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its huge cycling team will take over the center of the Olympics and reach the entire range of medals.
After presenting a truly exceptional and complete management in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced before Rio races.
There has been a drama, the least of which have not been the difference between technical director Shane Sutton in April due to sexism and temptation charges, as well as the ending of the competition of large people, such as Hoyn and Victoria Pendleton.
Based on the first night’s competitions at the cycling stadium, however, it seems that the legendary reputation of the United Kingdom now rises to its peak at the perfect moment could once again be true.
The future of Portland's melting due to the cuts in the electricity contract
The future of the Victoria aluminium alloy in Portland, as well as hundreds of labour jobs, is uncertain when the electricity company that distributes electricity to the factory revealed that one of the owners of the plant is deciding on a distribution contract, so it is expected that all distribution contracts will be cut.
The measure follows the earlier decision of the Victorian administration this year that the aid required for the operation of the plant will not be continued.
The 20-year period will end in November.
Even 2,000 jobs can be put at risk at the Alcoa Portland factory.
Even 2,000 jobs can be put at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the plant.
In addition, snowball effect can be possible, as the melting plant uses around 10% of the total electricity production in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the molten of Point Henry, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's melting power loses money and is under a closing threat.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which began as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently resulted in the price of the plant’s production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to the large aluminium alloy at the Loy Yang An power station in Latrobe Valley, said it also expects three other owners to decide their contract.
Most of the factory is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
“AGL is waiting for Portland’s factory to continue, which means that the physical electricity consumption of the molten will continue,” he said.
According to the AGL, the agreements are so-called 'protection agreements', which had to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a 12 month notice period, so they will actually end in 2017.
“For this reason, AGL expects contracts to produce results in the year 2017, the electricity company said.
All possible results for AGL from the year 2018 onwards are limited by the strong prospects of the future market for electricity wholesale prices.
AGL said it was already a \"depreciating end\", reducing the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the agreements would not affect the ability of Alcoa to keep melting in operation or to secure the electricity supply of the molten.
The U.S. company said that it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the agreement had to enter into force this year in November, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the agreement.
Analysts have been equipped with both the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the possible closure of the Tomago factory near Newcastle, as the economic situation in the sector is poor.
Earlier this week, Stephen Mikkelsen, CEO of AGL, told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts each year.
“If both plants leave the market, this is a significant reduction in demand for [electric power] markets.
As an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing, he said.
Kendall, not just the Kardashian real-tv star, is on the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-mother Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter, is on the cover of the U.S. Vogue's desired September number.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and has been modeled by Milan, Paris and New York fashion designers, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
Watching this deck in a room full of loved people made me cry, Kendall wrote.
The cover was followed by a unique (or perhaps only suitable for the style of the Kardashians) scripted reality video, where the entire Kardashian-Jennerin clan (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, with all the favorite entertainment, the Keep Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot the cover of his sister, but ended in the classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
It’s almost every child’s television show – the birthday anniversary – a cliché line (Seacrest says the lines – you didn’t think we’d forget you – with the credibility of the morning-scratching pop-up), but Krisin had to get his other girls somehow to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have surely moved to the new Kardashian era with Vogue in September.
Kendal’s isosiko Kim may have brought Vogue’s action first (because he shared it with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite his own class.
Vogue’s September number is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness resembles more coffee tables than fashion boxes, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (from Fashion calculated that 615 of the 832-page learning last year was advertising content).
Its cover-star revelation is so expected that for the last two years the pictures of the magazine have leaked before the official publication.
Former women on cover have been Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangeligel, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more – publications that work as models – than models that are celebrities –
The Oscar winner and Dior's Ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on deck in 2013, after Lady Gaga's honor.
But if it were to happen that Jenner, a magazine that describes his generation as a model of success, would hit his first category, he's in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not famous people's relatives or reality stars or today's young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all this).
They are rightly talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
With the release of Lemonade, Beyoncé has been one of the strongest years of her career.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
His true-tv history will always have a grim position in the fashion world.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them \"the mother of this moment.\"
This feeling rose back to the surface with Jenner’s Vogue cover.
But in dissatisfaction, the rotation is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on Vogue's September number.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He sells you Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their applications found behind the payment wall.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that he took to the LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, perhaps just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, he's a true TV star.
Community legal centres turn 160 000 people away each year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people will be turned away annually from the legal centres of the Community, as the sector prepares for the impact of additional cuts in funding on its activities at its borders.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly from the old, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair tortures and against similar people - are already turned away in search of free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already stretched to extremes of the Community are preparing for further cuts.
In June of next year, these legal centres will lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that, according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government’s decision was not withdrawn, the situation would only get worse.
“Queensland’s legal centres are chronically underfinanced, which means that thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need each year,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and depraved debts, housing families, unfairly separated workers - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not receive the help they need.
The federal government cuts funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of unprotected people in Queensland are forced to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis to immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the State Government pledged to increase the funding of legal aid to the national average level.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community legal centre and their customer communities, and the Government of Palaszczzzuk should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was challenged after the employee was accused of being armed.
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was challenged by the right to say that they did nothing after they were told that the campaign’s chief of operations in North Carolina threatened with a gun employee in February when they drove in Jeep.
The incident was described as the state campaign’s former software coach Vincent Bordin’s appeal on Wednesday at the Charlotte State Court.
For months, he waited for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized that it would not happen.
Chief Earl Phillip pointed out the pistol, put his right finger on the trigger, and pushed the barrel against Vincent's knee-lute.
After choosing the local and regional campaign management, the Bordini heard that at least four other people had had similar experience with Phillip, it was said in the complaint.
“We don’t have to fire things to cause damage,” he said.
The challenge will come only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger when telling the public in North Carolina that “a second addition to the people – which is usually understood by gun owners and gunmen – could take action if his competitors Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to elect judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media has taken his word out of the context and that he is not in favour of violence.
The Bordin Challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for careless monitoring and from Phillip for violence, abuse, and emotional shock.
Trump's representative Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to the request for comments.
The attempts to reach Phillip did not succeed.
WCCB, a local news company in Charlote, reports Phillip’s recent departure from the campaign.
The call request submitted to the Innovative Consulting Services by his consultant company was not answered immediately.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case against Bordin is Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain needs to channel the Olympics’ lives and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flowering throughout the stomach, not only to local communities and across London.
For me, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was also the charm of the London 2012 races, when we saw enormous effort to ensure that all our people and regions would benefit from the races.
The Olympics gained enormous benefits for Stratford and East End.
And we do that again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses close to Heathrow.
Only local communities create 10,000 new internships and 40,000 new jobs, and eliminate youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as before the London 2012 races, some come to think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for competition, and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
The obstacles are always overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and 211 billion new jobs in economic growth, as well as to leave the heritage of skills and employment around both the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which has completed 11 billion in the time and budget of the £7 infrastructure investment program: T5, which has been voted the best airport terminal in the world in five years in a row, to T2, which was built between the two fastest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to implement the third runway, supported by 16 billion euros of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for the UK, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also it.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a heritage of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is president of Heathrow Board and former Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Cat and Mouse To Prevent Advertising
For companies that get money from online advertising, companies skip the advertising-promotion program are “kiss” and mouse play, one of the companies that manufacture such a program said.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertising inhibitors from using their computer pages, Adblock Plus published a blog writing that said users could update the program filters to prevent advertisements on social network pages again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that the code of its website was changed around ads to make it more difficult for advertisers to find out which parts of the website are advertisements.
But now Adblock says it's been orbiting a new code.
In the blog paper, Ben Williams, a representative of Adblock, wrote that “the unfavorable struggle between the open source advertising community and its tourrs has been ongoing since the invention of the anti-advertising of ads, and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how much sorrow the advertisers have become in the industry.
About 200 million people worldwide use advertising inhibitors, are reported in the study of Pagefair and Adobe last year. This is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile entertainment now covers 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company is following the anti-advertisers of the pages used on the computer, because mobile advertisers do not operate on Facebook in mobile applications to social network or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer ads are still generating enough revenue to make Facebook think that such a measure is worth investing.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said it would update its “advertise” tool to give people more power about how ads are targeted to them.
Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrying, as they would also prevent part of the site from being non-advertising.
“This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem,” Facebook’s representative said in an email statement.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
The woman was hit by a car on a Swiss highway, apparently because of suicide.
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses after a woman left on the highway under several vehicles in early hours on Thursday in case of suicide.
The incident occurred on A1 route near Morges in Vaud's canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did an unscrupulous act and lay in the dark on the road where she was hit by several drivers, Vaud's police said in the statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who hit several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but not all have been identified yet, the police who appeals to them and all witnesses who witness the incident have been reported.
The criminal investigation has begun, which is a “logic” step in this situation, the lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genevelle.
However, let’s see if anyone can get a charge from the involved drivers.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It's going to be settled by the prosecutor, Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years indicate that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases, where both had a person who walked on the dark highway, it was estimated that motorists could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the magazine was said.
Last year, the police were released from custody after he hit and killed a man lying near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and had passed out on the road, the court was told.
The court found that the police, who were responding to the emergency call, were in a reasonable manner, and that the man’s presence on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone who has information about a Thursday case near Morges should call the police number 021 644 83 46 or 020 644 44 44.
NASA’s climate model: Venus was once inhabited
According to NASA’s new climate model estimates, Venus was likely to live once.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed the model to study Venus’s past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus would have hot, waterless surfaces and carbon dioxide filling with the aircraft development could sometimes have been underground conditions.
Scientists have previously shown that Venus’ slow speed of rotation explains its thick atmosphere.
But the last simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere, and it could still have run slowly.
The model also looked at the surface formation of the early Venus.
The planet probably had areas that were drier than the Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to make life possible and quickly protect water from the evaporation of water.
The advantage of the early Venus was also 30 percent darker than the sun.
“In the simulation of the GISS model, Venus’ slow rotation exposes it to the sun for almost two months at a time, GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in the news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer that works like a umbrella protecting the surface of much of the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average temperature of the climate is actually a few degrees cooler than the current Earth.
The model produced a story of Venus’ development that is similar to what the planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to have lived at times, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans faded and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen fled, there was only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus, which we now know.
The researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy gives up Avalanche's coach's nest
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the action of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Colorado Avalanche and ice hockey, i.e. as a result of the lack of opportunity in the team decision-making process.
Joe Sakic, Vice President of Colorado, confirmed the information and noted that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the last three years, I have committed myself as Vice President of the Colorado Avalanche ice hockey issues and as Chief Coach with enthusiasm, passion and determination,” said Roy, a 50-year-old.
I have been thinking about how I could improve this team for a long time in the summer to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the view of the Vice-President of the coach and ice hockey should be fully aligned with the vision of the organisation.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
\"Patrick told me today about his decision,\" Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the benefit of the organization, and we wish him happiness in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the league’s best coach during the first Avalanche season 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the middle division to win, but Minnesota poured down Colorado's first round, and the team hasn't continued in the last two years.
Avalanche's games over the period 2015-16 ended in 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draw-offs, and the team lost at five points to Wild, losing the Western conference's wild card to drop-off place.
Hall of Fame's chosen goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cupia - two in Montreal Canada and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone the strike
The labour struggles of North Sea oil workers due to wages will be postponed when all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leaders said.
Laws against Wood Group have been randomly organized by the Royal Dutch Shell-led North Sea Drilling trails.
\"Wood Group, as well as the Unite and RMT associations, can confirm that we have agreed to reinitiate the process aimed at resolving the current dispute,\" the joint opinion read.
During the next few weeks, we will hold several full-time meetings starting early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to the trade unions, their recent work struggles, which they claim to be the first over 25 years, were a counterclaim for possible, up to 30% pay cuts.
This year, Wood Group cut the fees of North Sea contractors by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company’s remuneration reduction is followed by a 10% reduction of its contractors in its countries in 2014.
The company said that further cuts would give the company the necessary mobility space to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced thousands of people’s salary lists and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries when the company reduces its operations as a result of its large-scale fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower prices of crude oil, and this economic situation is exacerbated by the British June decision to leave the European Union.
Mr Dave Anderson met with allies earlier this week to discuss one-generation of the largest labour disputes in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea is essential to the economy of the region.
\"We need a economy that works for many, not just a few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country,\" he said.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than $1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average of the previous five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the star cluster of Plejajads
The last task of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete list of the speeds of rotation of the stars of the Plejajad constellation.
The new data will help astronomers understand why the stars of the constellation rotate at varying speeds, as well as how the cycle times relate to the planet formation.
“We hope that by comparing our results to other star groups, we will now learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its age and even its solar history – Caltech’s infrared processing and analysis of the Pasadena Centre’s research in the press release.
The Plejajajai star group is located 445 light-years from the Earth.
Many of the stars have been born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They're running at their top level now.
At peak speed, these adult stars eat large amounts of star wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
When the star expires, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by following the appearance of detectable star clouds, such as sunspots.
The last list of star rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, bigger than smaller ones.
\"In the Peljajajas-balet, we see that the slow spinsters are usually more massive, while the fastest spinsters are usually very light stars,\" Rebull said.
Since the star cluster of Plejads is so close, it is the ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing the characteristics of stars at rotational speeds.
“Plejajajai’s star group offers anchor star rotations of theoretical models that understand both directions, younger and older,” Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why stars slow down their rotational speed and so-called hang their dance shoes on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Plejajajai’s rotational speeds in three articles that will be published shortly in the Astronomic Journal.
