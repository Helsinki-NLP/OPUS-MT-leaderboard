Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, diagnosed with mental illness, and now she's making an art on the subject - \"A man should have a right to his own body.\"
There are dozens of patient reports hanging from the roof of Project room gallery at the Academy of Fine Arts.
Each of them reads the name of Camille Auer.
Papers tell a multi-annual story of how external people have written up their interpretations of Auer and its identity.
He decided who he was.
“I wanted to tell the person my moderate treatment history so that the violence in the process would become visible,” Auer says.
At the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a long-term study period with meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process begins by sending a \"family identity disorder\" to diagnosing studies conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.
The process started four years ago with the Auer.
Before that, he had used the estrogen he ordered through the internet and was in his very long-term repair process.
He felt he was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person has to go through the repair process so that sex can also be corrected legally.
Translaki, i.e. the law on establishing the gender of transceivers (563/2002) requires transgender people to be forced into forced sterilization so that the right sex can be obtained, for example, at the Population Register Centre and passports.
At present, each gender correction is required for a psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of infertility.
A person has the right to decide on his own body.
“This situation is unbearable and violates human rights,” said Auer.
The reform of the Translaf has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling requiring the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to comply with the right of self-determination.
The previous government of Finland prepared a change of law under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovise.
The elections and the basic Finns came to the government.
Now the law change is stuck again.
This is a matter of internal policy disputes that are not even related to this law.
“The administration does not want to raise it to the table because there are differences within the government with the law change,” says Frank Johansson, executive director of the Department of Amnesty Finland.
The front part of the exhibition is dominated by two major installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the University Hospital of Tampere’s transpolyptic psychology in Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a report on the basis of these, which should be defined as the treatment of Auer’s right and assistance.
The perception of the reality of the study appears to be vulnerable to snoring.
The study of self-expressed perceptions of itself appear in a cross-border manner, and the unstable features of personality are highlighted.
Auer did not recognize himself in these descriptions.
\"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness,\" said Auer.
Even greater shock was when Auer was not given gender correction.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his identity.
On 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transpoli's waiting ball on television.
Later that television was created by a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
“It’s crazy that any person in the birth of a woman can increase his breasts, but to remove breasts needs a diagnosis,” said Auer.
Your body is not yours if you experience anything other than the number of your sex as defined in birth.
Unfortunately, the experience of the Auer is not the only one of its qualities.
The gender correction process is more severe for many spiritual reasons than for purely medical operations.
Its passings meet dozens of people who need to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
“It’s crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment, claiming that their resources are not enough,” said Auer.
Many people in the process have mental symptoms: depression, anxiety, potential bullying experiences.
In these cases, the medical staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be initiated.
“Inhibition of care and assistance can feed a person into a worse situation than it was before the process was started,” said Auer.
Auer’s own exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: “I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that’s what people usually find difficult to melt.
The depression has been treated with medications and when Auer started using hormones, the feeling was relieved.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had existed in childhood and teenager.
Why the wide jaw did not seem suitable for its own body, and why the muscles of the chest had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing to Auer is that there are people around him who see him.
Being seen is a fundamental need.
“We have to justify so much by speaking, dressing, using voice and moving,” he says.
Today, Auer is already seeing him, he exists as a woman.
In the early stages of the process, however, close random comments could have hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when the loved ones abuse.
“They should know and they know who I am, but they do not or can’t internalize it, he continues.
However, not all transiters need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, i.e. body conflict, where the body or parts of the body can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
Without the use of hormones and a long research process, however, one cannot obtain official confirmation of its own gender.
“There is no medical justification for these studies,” said Auer.
And that's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal gender.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to legal sex.
A full-time applicant makes a written application for a new identity, telling him he or she feels that he or she is a second-sex person.
After a half-year period of discretion, the applicant shall confirm his application in writing and the Ministry shall give the applicant a new identity ID.
This right of self-determination is also required for Finland and this requirement is also covered by the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political changes at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The Civil Rights Organization issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National NACP Organization for Civil Rights of African Americans has issued a travel warning for Missouri, which is the reason for the discriminatory practices of the State and the racist attacks that took place there.
“NACP’s travel data on Missour will enter into force on 28 August 2017, and calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and to take utmost caution when travelling in a state where there have recently been a number of controversial racial-based events.
In Missouri, the recent law in force complicates the right to export cases of discrimination. In addition, the enforcement of state laws is disproportionate to minorities. According to the NACP, these factors led to a travel warning.
“People’s civil rights are being violated.
They are stopped on the basis of the color of the skin and are being abused or killed, the president of the NACP Missouri Rod Chapel said to Kansas City Star.
“We’ve never heard of one of the many cases in a very short time.
Missouri travel information is the first warning on the United States state.
The organization mentioned, for example, the racist comments against African American students at Missouri University and the death of 28-year-old Tory Sanders.
Sanders died earlier this year in question, and he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and Missouri police arrested him, even though he was not accused of a crime.
The travel report also referred to Missouri’s report that the police stop 75 percent more likely than the white driver.
“The purpose of the travel notice is to encourage people to be alert and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri,” says Chapel.
“People need to prepare for, for example, by involving money for the payment of guarantees or by telling relatives that they are planning to travel through the state.
According to the FBI, in 2015, the Missouri accounted for one hundred hate crimes, the sixth most of the U.S. states.
Travel warning is also a response to Missouri’s new law, which makes it difficult to challenge companies from discrimination in housing and employment relations.
The ACLU, which has guaranteed the rights of citizens guaranteed by the Constitution, recently gave travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had adopted immigration laws binding the police to arrest people for immigration violations. According to the organization, this increases racial profiling.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and relate to other countries. Recently, NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the supplementary pension of the CEO
Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä (centrally) has asked Finnair for a report on the supplementary pension fee received by the airline’s CEO Pekka Vauhamo, Yle.
According to the Minister, it is in conflict with the state's will.
The additional pension of EUR 130 000 received by Vairamo increased this week, when the Helsinki Sanomat announced the development of the remuneration of the directors of the stock exchange companies.
The Finnish Journal News of Vairamo’s supplementary pension in February.
Finnair announced that she would give up on supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has suggested that no additional pensions will be used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the last year’s ownership control decision.
The packages immediately tightened the words.
A while ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia are on their way from cold to warm.
During the G20 meeting in Hamburg, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to be working well with each other.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions adopted by the U.S. Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were strongly addressed in Russia.
Tyrmävi's response has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, according to which the Sanctions Act signed by Trump means \"full-scale trade war\".
Although the Russian reaction would only be a sign of political rhetoric and overreactions, the tightening between the United States and Russia is a fact after the short period of pre-election of Trump.
In the United States, it was not easy to go through the U.S. Sanctions Act on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
However, Congress passed the law with considerable consensus, but the adoption of the law to the President was much more difficult, according to the report.
Trump criticises the law that he has signed as a significant lack of meaning.
President Trump's sympathies must have been the cause of Russia in particular, although the adoption of a law restricting his or her rights must have been objectionable.
As well known, the US is investigating the possible involvement of Russia in presidential elections and Trump's campaign on Russia's connections.
The tightening between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short period of governorship.
When the White House staff has changed, and different scandalous translations have become almost up-to-date, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being made in the United States under the leadership of the President, but in spite of the presidents.
Such a situation is in no way desirable.
If Russia's relationship is a tsunami in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region will also intensify relations in the Baltic Sea.
The EU has clearly demonstrated the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained at least one-sided in Russia's policy, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State that trades a lot with Russia like Finland, economic sanctions have been real.
The effects of the U.S. law are still unclear.
The EU has been afraid that sanctions will complicate the functioning of many European companies.
For example, the effects in Finland can be felt in Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project as well as possibly in Fennopower’s nuclear power plant project.
In Europe, acidity has been caused by the fact that, for example, the US economy has been left outside the sanctions, an important liquid natural gas lng.
Trade sanctions are a means of demonstrating abuse in world politics.
However, economic sanctions must be very prudent and precise.
Otherwise, they can be more harmful than useful.
Isn't nothing holy anymore?
Trump's White House is now facing the Statue of Liberty.
Lacking is a sure sign of a change of power.
Americans know it as well as others: Iraqis fell together with American soldiers in the statue of Saddam Hussein in the square of Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologies of Trump's administration, knew well what was going on in an exciting debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta.
Miller didn't really appreciate the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been hit by huge sets of cruise organizers and imaginative characters from the Statue of Liberty.
His attack was about the importance of the statue, and in particular that in 1903 the statue’s foot was added to the poem of Emma Lazarus – 17 years after the statue was completed.
This is how Miller’s bag Acosta says: “I don’t want to go more closely into history now, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was later added, and it is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller wasn't wrong, but it's not just about history, as he said himself.
The most important are Lazarus’ touching words, the only quality in which the state does not only call immigrants, but the poorest: “Your tired, your por, / Your hundled masses yearning to breathe free,
The poem is now more current than ever.
Miller didn't write a literary criticism, and he made it clear that the poorest of the poor are not welcome to Trump in the United States.
The debate on the importance of the Freedom Pact is part of a broader political and cultural dispute about the importance of the United States.
Lazarus’ friends campaigned after his death for the poem to be attached to his statue's feet. They knew well that the act was a strong political act.
The purpose of the statue was to express the links between French and American republics with a classic symbol of freedom by a feminine bodyization.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female character is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the deported mother.
The connection of the poem to his imagination was a brilliant feminist coup and devastating attack on American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
Rush Limbaugh – a designer, which can now be regarded as some kind of a prophecy about Trump – claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not being called to anyone, but is an early pioneer of the New Conservatives who takes the United States to the dark to cover up the world: “Lady Liberty stands out.
He takes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
It doesn't show the way to the United States.
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The importance of freedom depends entirely on the perspective.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and exhausted, but the hopeful immigrants from the ship's deck after a long and experimental journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for a better life.
His Statue of Liberty will be comforted by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's what Miller and Trump don't want.
Their bulls don’t show the way, but the flames of anger, their only source of power.
World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the UK National Team
Eilith Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots reached the UK National Team
Neil Black, the executive director of the UK General Sports Association, says that 16 Scottish members of the team participating in the World Championships are a significant reinforcement.
The number of Scottish athletes has been selected for the World Championships starting in London on Friday.
According to Black, there is something special about Scotland, where British sports need to be learned.
“This is welcome and we continue to study it for so long as we understand what it is about,” Black says.
“Keskustel with the representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sports, and they thought it was related to the Institute’s activities.
The Scottish General Sports Association believes that it is related to the activities of the Union,
The United Kingdom General Sports Association believes that it is behind their activities.
And an ordinary streeter thinks he has to have something to do with it.
But it's something amazing, what it's about.
Many Scottish athletes compete in London for serious medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah on a run of 5,000 metres. Elith Doyle was elected captain of the team.
\"Elith is too modest.
His speech was incredible, Black says.
“The athletes were proud of their achievements and strongly motivated regardless of where they lived and practiced.
There was a real feeling and passion for sports in the words of Eilidhi.
Eilith Doyle is a world championship champion at 400 metres, and these are his fifth World Championship. He believes it is unbelievable that the team has 16 Scottishs.
The previous record was from seven years 1983 and 2015.
Laura Muir has been running five British and two European records over the course of the year.
He competes in London at 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs in London at 1,500 meters. It is also worth keeping an eye on him: the man has an excellent season behind him, including winnings in the UK World Championships and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Championship, when the only Scottish team in the country was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says he's very proud of the fact that there are so many Scottishs involved, some of which are seriously competing with final locations and medals.
“Captain access is a great honour, but it is even more special because the members of the team voted for the captain,” Doyle said.
“I am, of course, very proud of all the skis that got into the country team.
It shows how far we've come.
They're involved in prestigious athletes who compete for prize winners.
Captain's speech?
I thought it went well.
I focused on how lucky we are when we have home competitions.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are at the Olympic Stadium again.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere will be amazing.
Preventing critics on Facebook: Do not apply to a public office if you do not withstand criticism
Our father knew what was bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticise him for all possible domestic politics, always in his political principles.
Critics must be annoying,
But he did not silence his critics.
“If the freedom of speech is removed, we may be led as dumb and quiet as sheep for slaughter,” Washington said in 1783.
That's where we're going to get to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their performers.
The U.S. Civil Rights Union challenged Hogan's court earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge to be unfounded, and his attitude was also low online.
This is just Facebook, many comments.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the most amazingly popular Republican governor in the state ruled by Democrats.
He has received the second best reviews among the 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to heat.
He has managed the state steadily and strictly adhered to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main channel of communication to his voters and published a photo of the baldness in chemotherapy.
Therefore, preventing users from coming to the Governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff on tax assets.
Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Chase, defended the Governor's actions in his interview with Washington Post.
However, it is too easy to identify commentators as trolls, spampers or haters.
Washington Post interviewed users who blocked Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their chosen leaders, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors.
They said their comments were respectful, attentive and relevant.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to the Catholic faith of Hogan.
The lawyer, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Maryland, Bowie, was not hostile, but asked a question of hate crimes.
“I was politely disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand for hate crimes and other recent news,” he wrote in Washington Post’s comments.
I also cannot accept that when many people comment on the same thing, they are considered to be an organized group in some way and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens.
The Governor's staff called the comments \"a centralized attack,\" someone else could call them to promote important things.
During the Facebook era, communication is easy to manage by preventing a critic or removing a critical comment.
Before the old age, we should have sent staff to collect and burn newspapers that had published critical documents, or to arrest and silence protesters.
This is the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be charged with the interception of Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have challenged him.
The first major decision was taken in Virginia last week.
According to James C. Cacheris, the government of the district of Loudoun violated the first increase in the U.S. Constitution in preventing the voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Union went on to discuss the use of Twitter and Facebook by the Republican Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin.
This shouldn't be difficult.
During Washington, low-cost postal charges had a similar effect to today's internet.
The number of newspapers was quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and the anonymous writers molested Washington.
At that time there were trolls.
The names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters in the newspapers in which they heard Washington’s decisions.
The President's Office received requests to review Jay's agreement, the United States-UK cooperation, trade and shipping agreement, which is reflected in documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of speech are the basic stones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer food of birds should be stopped immediately.
The samples have come from about 40 places, and in addition to online notifications about the couple, three.
Most of them have come from southern Finland and Varsinais Finland, but then also individuals from Haapavesi and the Seinajoki, special researcher Marja Isomursu Evira.
Green beads are dead in the superstitions called tricomonosis.
It is caused by a scientifically called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has been previously known to hit the pigeons, and especially those in the broth.
In the 21st century, however, the disease was also detected by peppolins.
In 2009, it was very good.
At that time, tricomonosis caused a major collapse in the Finnish green spot, after which, the species’s positions have been on a recovery path.
There have been sick green beads now, but at least not yet in a large scale, the Museum of Science at the University of Helsinki (Luomus) says.
It is feared that the previous epidemic of green bulbs will recover again unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: to stop the summer food of birds immediately.
More about it later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from homefield representation at the Renassance Club
The former European player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the homefield performance for the next three days, when Renaissance Club in Eastern Lothian organizes the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Last year, the North Irish Rafferty led the tournament held in the Archerfield Links field in the neighborhood before the last round, but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty has liked a new place and works as a tournament ambassador for the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
“I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it gets to its full glory,” Rafferty says.
“The players see the field at their best. It’s in great shape.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He is an enthusiastic ambassador of the game, and he is proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great show event for this field.
English Eales defends the championship for the first time, even though he has won a 32-year career in both European tour and European challenge tour.
\"This seems like a very special occasion,\" the player in Southport said.
“I couldn’t stand to defend my extremedura Open victory because the tournament isn’t part of the tour this year.
It's great to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to mind: the tournament win was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time we would always remember.
Gary Orr is going back to work on his own soil, and he went on tour after 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
“To play at home is always more relevant,” says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
You want to succeed, but you also know the extra pressure.
I’ve enjoyed playing again and played quite well.
I am happy with the game so far.
The three will be followed by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament includes six Scottishs: Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Car parking costs five pounds if there is only a driver in the car, and ten pounds if there are at least two people in the car.

Possible indoor air problems of the Cascarm were identified in the Sokylä
No indoor air problems have been found at least so far, the private communications company of Pori has been reported on Thursday.
Internal air studies will continue.
The reports began when a man who discontinued his military service for health reasons thought his health was weakened due to the bad indoor air of the chamber.
According to Colonel Mika Holma, the Chief of Staff of the Por Brigade, there have been no problems in the health situation of other backup men.
It turned out that the case was an individual incident and that no other servants in that unit had any health problems.
Each statement is taken seriously and we wanted to explain this issue thoroughly.
At the moment, we are not aware that we have any internal air problem, Holma says.
The Privacy Notice says that due to the arrival of July, the cashiers have had to be transferred to the boxes, which may have led to a temporary increase in dust.
The air may have been intruding, says Holma.
Poverty and death in the goldland of Indonesia
Bardina Degei does not use the heat of his food.
He rarely uses Katila.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Pania region, located in Indonesia’s restless province of Papua. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts a batat – locally – not – directly on fire.
In half an hour, the cake burned to the karre will be eaten with an unscrupulous, unwashed hand.
There are no furniture in Dege's home, and he's sitting on a muddy painting, where he usually treats his daily scales as well, like the seawater from the near summer of the laundry.
The office is served by a bucket in a dead room.
Degei is his youngest of four wives, and he is not assigned to be treated.
Diversity is common here.
Later working can be dangerous: most of the people in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot. In addition, it is necessary to take into account the soldiers.
\"No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening,\" Degei says.
This is a rare curation in the upperlands of Papua the Ark, the former Dutch colony, which was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969, preceded the accession of a controversial referendum, with 1 026 village elders being forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed the power of the Netherlands, quickly turned its anger to the Jakarta Government, which holds the territory strictly under its control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from accessing it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is remote and the coin. The journey starts there with a half an hour's flight from the capital of the province of Jayapur to Nabire and continues with a five-hour drive to the rental car.
There is no public transport here.
About 19,000 inhabitants in the city are surrounded by woodlands surrounded by bamboo, with a wave of roses dyed as cellars.
Only a few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago tribes worshipped the god Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
\"We didn't have any of these clothes,\" Degei says. \"He means a colorful, hand-painted ginger head, dark hamet and bright-colored blouse.
Before, we only had magazines covered with our bodies.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and childhood mortality and illiteracy are the highest in Asia.
But it is also the goldland of Indonesia.
Panai is a top area of about the size of New Jersey, with 153,000 inhabitants. Only about a hundred kilometers from Pania is Grassberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix, the United States.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in wood reserves.
However, these riches bring misery to the Egyptians, as they mean the suppressive presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid nearly 20 million dollars to local military personnel and military local units between 1998 and 2004.
Papuan’s requirements for greater self-determination threaten this source of income, and they are silenced with mercy.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 Palestinians and raped, tortured, and captured thousands.
According to the Asian Committee on Human Rights, mass deaths in the highlands of the Papua tribes in the 1970s resulted in the proportions of genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested over 3,900 people in peaceful protests.
In the 2016 report of the Brisbane Archdiocese, We Will Lose Everything has reports of the brutalities of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – rapes and electric shocks are particularly popular – and unrelenting attacks towards peaceful protests.
“It’s difficult to calculate the number of victims because the cases are weekly,” says Andreas Harsono, a Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Ruuvia has been blackmailed when Papua’s natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are Christians, but the population structure is changing when Indonesian settlers from Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes move Muslims to the region in the hope of a better living.

It's hard for locals to compete.
“Abeth You, 24-year-old, is from Pania and moved to the capital of the province.
“The local women lost their customers.
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to address the injustice of Papua and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won a vote in 27 districts, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta’s presidential capital.
But little has changed with Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts broke because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and waited for him to fulfill our wish and restore justice,” you said.
There was a kind of wave base only two months after Jokowin’s local officials.
The eleven children were singing Christmas songs at the Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the dark on motorcycles.
Scared children told soldiers that they should use driving lights.
One of the soldiers didn't like the note. According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebain, the man returned to his place with four soldiers.
According to the reports of victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers captured children and abused them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of assault.
A few hours later, the building of the government election board, located near the venue, was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand Palestinians – young men and women and children – gathered in the football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They were accompanied by hunting springs for feasts, and they began to perform the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago, where they danced in circles and traced the bird song.
Some of the protesters began to stone police and military buildings.
When the mood warmed up, the soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: “If the human forces do resistance more than three times, shoot them to death – the information is based on the official document on the TIME magazine that has not been published to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of residence of the Kego Koto region, was apprehensive of the situation and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
\"When I turned around, I was shot at the left,\" he told the TIME magazine with his bright-colored wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the lines of the soldiers.
There were several shootings in the village.
Alfius Youwia was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
“I ran to him and made sure it was him,” Yohanes TIME told the newspaper that he was sad.
\"I saw him dead... I kissed him...
The police officer Yotje Mende told reporters that the police only protected the police station because it was under attack.
“We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said Pudjo Sulstiyo, a reporter from Papua Police in 2015.
“It’s about life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The information about death was collected in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi held an emotional speech in Jayapur where he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to address the violence of Papua.
“I want the case to be investigated immediately so that it never happens again.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would launch reports of human rights violations outside the legal system.
However, he began to cancel his speech immediately.
“The vast majority of the crimes occurred a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate infringements, but it requires certain processes, he said.
In the interview in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he wasn’t going to start the studies with Papua.
\"All will be investigated in court,\" he said.
The United Nations accuses Wiranto of crimes against humanity: The crimes are linked to the death of more than a thousand people in the bloody independence of East Timor in 1999 Wiranto told the TIME that 11 cases of Papuan human rights violations had already been investigated, including the events of Pania.
The families of the victims of Pania are unbelief about the claims.
“I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way,” Yohanes says.
I'm tired of this.
He continues to live in fear, even though the event has been for years.
I'm afraid, he says.
\"I'm afraid the army's gonna arrest me, but I'm afraid I'm gonna be shot.
His brother, Yacobus, confirms that the panicians are afraid to discuss the event.
He says the soldiers had abused him when he had helped bury four victims.
\"The soldiers are looking for me after the funeral of the victims,\" he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in the neighboring area of Pania in Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the village and the head of the construction company, which began when the manager refused to take his consciousness to the lost man hospital. Among the injured were children.
The man who was in need of hospital treatment was a 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been caught in water while fishing in a nearby river, and died on his way to the hospital.
The hated villagers expressed their views on the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned the police who responded with warning shots.
However, according to locals, the Indonesian military police force opened fire towards the crowd, when one of the villagers was killed.
“We’re afraid of revenge,” says Dominggu Badi, 29 years old, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to treatment.
I have been hiding at home for two days.
The Deiyai Parliament has called for police officers to be responsible for shooting shots and to withdraw the moving police force from the area.
There has always been a problem with the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds dissatisfaction in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, living in the wheat-melts of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army claiming to defend the Palestinians' rights by random attacks and the kidnappings of Indonesian military soldiers.
Some of the leaders of OPM are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded by arresting and arbitrary imprisonment for thousands of people in Pania – the protection of national sovereignty.
Some of the arrested will never return.
Among the Egyptians, Panai is known as a “surious, forgotten place”
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There is only a small amount of rice in the enarotal for sale, and it is also too expensive for locals,
Like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly Batats and some fruits and leaf vegetables.
Viljely is women's work, and one woman's responsibility can have four or five batat games.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest are sold on the market.
Ten Batats cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the differences between local and migrant income have increased and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
There are few jobs, and they usually go to the locals for better educated and more wealthy migrants.
Few people have enough capital and skills to run their own business competitively.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village because there’s no work or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Pania tribal council.
There is little attention in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been granted a rare description permit. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kinen, Asian Assistant Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises. He has not increased transparency and has not promoted development by removing restrictions on news.
“Indonesia’s most unrested eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua are at new risk: refusal to apply for a visa and entry into the black list,” Kine said in her statement.
The lack of freedom of action of the press means that only neighbouring neighbours of Papua will be pressured by the Indonesian Government.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the numerous and widespread violations of Papua, including the Pania shooting.
These countries have also traditionally supported Papua’s liberation movement.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, denied the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that “Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations.
Local governments want foreign governments to be missing the issue.
When the official delegation of the Netherlands, led by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapur on 4.5.2017, the locals violated silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says the anonymous source of remaining in the meeting.
In Indonesia there are presidential elections in 2019, but the Palestinians say that they will no longer vote for Jokowi.
Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who have been involved in the Pania shooting,\" said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowin to know the situation of the panicans: they live under the control of the greedy and unpredictable army in the absence and poverty, practically without health care and educational opportunities.
According to Gobai, the panicans, like the other priests, hold the sounds they gave to Jokow as a debt, which must be paid back.
They don't want money, they just want justice, he says.
Despite threats and fear, the relatives of the victims of the Pania shooting attack showed once more a comparison: they buried one of the victims in the country opposite the police station and the military office.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they will not let responsible ones forget their crimes.
\"My family member was killed,\" Yacobus says.
What else can we do?
Dereck Chisora barks at Robert Helenius's return match: “Even his own fans don’t want to see.
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora, a heavy-weight boxer, were scheduled to compete in Hartwall Arena on May 27th.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
Chisora is in a fresh interview with IFL TV for the reason for floping the game completely onto the shoulders of Helenus.
My fight in Finland was a flop, but it wasn't my fault.
I don’t live in Finland, I don’t want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him take a nap because he's bad, Chisora's bored.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in the perfect Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
The ticket sales went silent, and its promo Nisse Sauerland told East Sanom in May that the match had been moved to the autumn.
The competition has never been a new one.
However, the retreat will no longer harm Chisora.
In any case, the match would have to be cancelled after Chisora's illness.
On Thursday, three days before the time of the match, I woke up to the pain.
My girl was exploded.
The hospital said I had to be cut, Chisora says.
Britti says she's currently in about 45 percent condition.
He's not interested in a replaying game with Helenius, he's looking at Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss in December.
You've come to repeat the Torch pilot in Dubai.
The Liekis captured the world's highest-ranking residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents had to escape from a 337-metre 79-storey building.
This was the second fire within two years in a building called Torch.
The building was empty, and no one is known to have been injured. For the reason of the fire there was no idea immediately after the event.
“We were sleeping and awakening the fire alarm with a voice and people’s screams.
We ran stairs down the 50th floor, which took ten minutes, George's resident told Reuters.
According to the Dubai rescue authorities, the fire extinguished from four in the morning for local time and remained cooled the building.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who left their home.
The case may raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surfaces of high buildings around the world.
After the 2015 fire, the Board of Directors of the Torch building carried out a study that found out that the most damage was caused by the plates used for public clothing and insulation.
In the UK, the police believe that London’s Grenfeld Tower insulation and curtain plates could contribute to the rapid progress of flames in a fire where 80 people died in June.
Mopo was stolen from Joensuu’s parking lot during the night
In the middle of the week between 21 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Tuesday, Mopo was stolen.
Mopo disappeared from Niinivara at Tikkamäe 2.
Mopo was Sky Team Monkey.

In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers take prohibited items into the aircraft, reveal the survey
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had taken prohibited items knowingly or without knowing about planes through the U.S. Department of Traffic Safety (TSA) inspection points. At least six percent of passengers had knives or other steel-containing objects that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent said they had only known after that they had carried weapons, ammunition, or explosives in error.
The survey was answered by over a thousand passengers, and it was carried out by the Stratos Jet Charters chartering company, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to threaten the rules.
The TSA rules for consciously breached passengers were 19.7% of Y-generation representatives and less than 15% belonged to the X-segret.
The most common rule was broken by taking food and fluids to the plane.
More than 3% of men admitted that they had taken steel-containing objects consciously to the aircraft. In addition, 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men reported that they had taken prohibited drugs consciously into the aircraft.
The survey involved passengers from all over the United States. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many people had accidentally taken smuggling supplies through the security check and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that the most travelers are also most likely to pass the security check – knowingly or without knowing.
But, as the company that made the survey says, TSA’s instructions are very complex and confusing.
Passengers often don’t know what fluids can be taken and how much.
It’s no surprise, then, that most of TSA’s seizures are liquid.
For some time, there was also a belief that no books should be taken to the plane.
They may be taken on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, decided to delay Obama’s decisions to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states were sued by Scott Prutit, director of the US Environmental Protection Agency, Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smoke emissions during the Obama administration period.
According to the report, the change shows that the agency he manages takes better account of the needs of the decision-makers responsible for the state environment.
Pruitt did not mention an action which had been brought before the Federal Court of Appeal against his previous decision.
The States Parties should start to comply with the 2015 requirements for land-level ozone as of 1 October 2015.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would move forward the implementation of the decisions by the year, so that his agency would have more time to learn about the plan, because the Agency does not want to intervene in local decision-making or hamper economic growth.
Pruitt was a general prosecutor of Oklahoma State before President Donald Trump appointed him the head of EPA, known as the opponent of more stringent environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly attempted to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions by the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industries.
The sudden change of mind in the middle of the week is the latest setback for the Pruitt plan to mitigate the provisions.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington issued a decision that the head of the EPA exceeded its mandate to delay the implementation of the Obama administration decision on oil and gas companies.
In a Wednesday’s opinion, Pruitt claimed that his full version of the ozone regulations would only strengthen EPA’s cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
“In the past administration, EPA often failed to comply with deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to challenge the right to reach an agreement on timetables,” Pruitt said. In his previous action, he challenged the law of the Environment Agency more than ten times.
“We do not believe in the regulation through the trial and take seriously time limits.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it gives us.
However, the EPA opinion concluded that Pruitt may continue to exercise its powers to delay the implementation of the decisions and other legal powers to ensure that the provisions are justified and based on the best available information.
In Congress, Republicans are driving a wider change of ozone regulations.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions for at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the Senate.
This week, EPA’s general prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who led the New York State to the dispute, said that the group was going to continue its pressure.
“EPA’s change of mind as a result of our actions is a significant gain for the 6.7 million new Yorkers and over 115 million Americans exposed to the direct effects of the smokeum in their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the action included California, Connecticut, Deliware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Surface ozone is generated when emissions from, for example, cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
Thus, the resulting smoke bomb can cause serious respiratory difficulties for susceptible groups of people, and it is also involved in thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmental defenders welcomed the surprising shift in the direction of Pruitt.
“It’s worrying how much pressure was required to make the same guy who was responsible for our breath air made sense,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight against Trump’s administration, as its ideological aim is to act on the terms of the polluters and other groups that are in their own interests.
Supercar manufacturer coming from the street crane - events in Ferrari style –
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to hold onto its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it happens in Ferrari's style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said about the plans at the press conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year, when the Italian supercar manufacturer will present its new five-year plan, Automotive News will announce.
All cases of East Savo's ashes with the same virus type
Rantasalme is the same virus type as the previous cases of Eastern Savo, the THL is reported.
The virology laboratory of the Institute of Health and Welfare has ensured on Thursday that the fifth ashes infection of East Savo is the same viral strain as previous infections.
The THL has ensured that on Friday, July 28, a coastal person has the same virus type as the previous cases of East Savo.
Based on this information, all the infections in East Savo relate to the first ashes found in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means we haven’t had any other types of cancer virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may occur from the 5th of the disease until August, and therefore the epidemic is not yet over,\" says Mikraleena Erkkilä, a doctor responsible for the basic diseases of Soster’s health.
New ashes or their suspicions have not emerged since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the timing of their vaccination protection, Erkkilä recalls.
More about the topic: Pirkanmaa confirmed three new cases of ashes - \"Excessary infections or epidemics are highly unlikely\".
Finland prepares for a licensed film
It wasn't even considered legalizing the Pontika soup.
Based on the reason that the process produces, along with the vine, methanol, which is toxic.
Preparation of the shield at home will be legal next year, but the legalization of the porcelain soup will not even be considered.
The race is manufactured by use, and again by distillation.
There is a reason behind the regulation of Tislaus that the process generates, along with the wine, methane, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to regulate a spotless soup for every man's right, Ismo Importing from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry prepared for the reform of the Alcohol Act, it was not considered to be legalized.
It was also not brought to the political table.
There has been no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, according to MP Outi Mäkelä (kok.).
He is at the negotiating group of the parliamentary groups of government parties who took a position in the reform of the Alcohol Act.
The permission to barter at home cannot continue to be granted even upon application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain licensed.
Importing says that home-making of alcoholic beverages will be a simple rule: alcohol can be prepared at home by means of a visit.
This means that in addition to beer, cider and wine at home, you can legally make a race.
The government has wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law removes the requirements of flavours and flavourings and allows the production of the film, Mäkelä refines.
The preparation must continue to take place so that the ingredients and flavourings generated by the raw materials or their consumption are clearly visible in the drink.
According to the new law, drinks can be made as much as they want, and self-made alcohol can be given as a gift.
You can't still put it on sale.
Killing is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Importing believes.
A much greater change occurred in 2004, when the import of passengers from Estonia and other EU countries was released.
75 per cent of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol presentation is now being checked by the Ministry of Justice.
Alcoholicism comes to the parliamentary hearing as soon as the syphilis begins.
The sitting is 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament had already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was praised to the hospital by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from breast pain, was praised for heart attacks at a South African hospital.
Pistorius is already out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius suffers his prison sentence in Ateridgeville Prison.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison informant confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for research.
The Pistorius family informant said the former athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced the sixth-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Littered phone conversations reveal Trump's pressure on Mexico to build a border wall
US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have leaked literates to Washington Post.
Trump invited the Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop his public speech on 27 January 2017 about the fact that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States called Nieto to say that this had been a blow to the wall project in public.
Trump launched his presidential election campaign by promising to build the U.S. South border at the expense of the Wall at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also released a literation from Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. During the call, there was a sharp exchange of words.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on its way to Australia had to be laughed, sad, and stupid, according to Trump, the agreement negotiated during the Obama period would make him look like a \"idioot\" because he had proposed a ban on the residence of refugees in the United States.
Trump stopped the call by saying to Turnbull that this was the most unpleasant call of the day.
Georgia's massacre: The activists respite the right to racist licking in hope
Ford Mercury-marked car bypasss the crowd of Monroe's small town in Georgia's countryside and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, and four armed men are blocking the road before the car gets to the bridge.
The leader of the band, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit, takes a deep breath of his cigar and encampes through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
\"Roger, the man's on his ass.
“Out of the car”
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
This shocking event is, fortunately, only a re-establishment that was presented on 22 July 2007.
However, the shocks are real when the hanger loop is put on the neck.
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to rediscover the 1946 events. At that time, Ku Klux Klan cut two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been accused of murder.
“It’s confusing that no one has been arrested in these years – although murderers live among us and many need to know who they are,” Tyrone Brooks says.
“It’s the shame of history, but, above all, it’s a burden that weighs our soul.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian congressman.
To him, the reclamation is an alarming call for action, and it also reminds Monroe's residents that the injustice has never been corrected.
“We want the guilty to be brought to justice, and we want things to finally be completed, and we want to recover from grief and make an agreement, but above all we want justice,” Brooks said.
“We can’t recover and make a settlement until we get justice.”
The death investigator covers the body of the dead victim killed in a massacre in Georgia on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI documents received by NBC news, over 50 men from Monroe and surrounding districts were suspected of being suspended.
No one was accused of murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say that the motives of Lyncaus have been known to the locals all the time: politics and sex.
In 1946, the state of Georgia’s black people had the highest right to vote in the presidential elections for the first time. The Supreme Court issued its decision in April, and the elections were held in summer.
According to the FBI, at the time of the election, an incident occurred in which a black rental farmer Roger Malcom stabbed the White Landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently affected Malcom's wife Dorothy.
Brooks said the town was rumored that Hester had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting this child.
According to FBI records, the influential white landowner, Loy Harrison, paid $600 to Malcom on 25.7.1946, against whom he was released from prison.
On his way home with Malcom and Dorothy were their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford Bridge.
\"It turns out Harrison ordered and ordered the murders,\" the FBI report says.
“It is also evident that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities. The authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses.
Brooks expresses it more closely.
\"It was a right to vote,\" he said.
“They were murdered because black people wanted to communicate that they were going to do the same if they were going to vote.
Cassandra Greene has been directing the re-introduction of Georgia's massacre for almost a decade.
The show is extremely realistic and captivating, a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared in the United States today.
It's hard to look at the show, but it's even harder not to look at what Greene says.
“We don’t want to talk about the lanternism because we’d have to face our own dark side,” the director said.
“But I can’t create a relationship with you if you don’t hear me or you don’t want to hear what I’ve had to experience.”
The exercises of this year began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen blacks and twenty whites – gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the show.
Wade Marbaugh works as Greene's assistant director.
He has presented the local leader of Ku Klux Klan in the reintroduction for many years, but the role is always equally difficult and hostile.
\"It's gonna be dirty because I'm not myself,\" Marbaugh says.
“It’s important, however, that this side of history is also being held so that it will never happen again.”
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester are practicing.
The show begins with a scene where Malcom screams and pushs Hester, and he's upset that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothy.
Did you not hear me?
Rascona or Hester is responding.
Then let's go.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) is laughing.
Greene laughs harder.
- What? - Rascona asks.
He's in trouble.
\"Did I accidentally get too tight?\" he asked.
- No, Greene's a jerk.
“I just don’t think that the whites used the word “n-u” at that time.
“So, the other black actor will confirm.
“It’s slangia. You have to use a longer version.
The subject of the presentation is unpleasant, but the power of the room is a friend's spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, and they want to respect the memories of those who have been killed.
The scene begins at the beginning.
Now the words of Rascona are insulating.
No one laughs.
The re-establishment will end quickly and violently.
Rumors, shots, and silence.
A woman dressed at a black funeral stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday Strange Fruit.
His voice is broken in every other word.
A few ten meters away, fifty viewers will wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost half of the population is black and half white.
There is a couple who have come to see a show from Ithaca in New York, but most of them are local.
They have been guided by Brooks in the graves of the victims in the pressing humidity of Georgia.
The murders have turned from the story into reality, and the feeling at the scene is heavy.
After the song, Greene invites the crowd to check the bodies.
Children are able to look at artificial blood and unmotivated bodies and whisper at each other.
\"They're not really dead, a little boy's going to resemble himself.
In a few minutes, Greene would like to thank the public.
Actors who present the Lynkers remove their references and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then breaks into tears after a hard show.
It's all right, the woman involved in the show will comfort you.
We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason.
Later, the audience and the actors meet for a joint dinner.
The white couple who arrived from Altanta is very busy discussing the show with the black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski is hard to find words when she describes the feelings of the show.
“It’s hard to listen to awful words and watch terrible things that you say and do people that look the same as you, just because they look the same as you, he says.
“I found out that there are still some kind of riots going on, he added.
On the other side of the room Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for those sitting on the same table.
He says he has already started planning the next year's performance.
“Representation is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we’ve experienced, but it’s also a teaching experience,” Brooks says.
“The message is that this can happen again if we don’t learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it.
Growing up in stores is a waste of time: With the removal of excess parts, you can actually save
Is it allowed to remove the leaves of the flower already in the store before weighing?
What about taking a big hat out of the pineapple? It weighs how much?
The answers share opinions strongly: for one, it is an indication of the extreme influx, while others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that do not use and yet go home to rubbish.
The appearance is recognized in the stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket Department of the Helsinki Food Gulf, because many tear off flower leaf parts, for example.
From the box, the leaves are exported to the store for bio-waste.
According to the news published by economics, the fall asleep with the vegetable skis surprises traders.
But how much does removing extra parts of the vegetables before weighing really save money?
How important is it to sleep?
We women tested how the price changes when taking leaves or strains away from pineapple, latva-artis, treats, broccoli and floral.
Flower cabbage: EUR 2.10 to pay the price of flower cabbage came EUR 1.80, when all leaves were peeled out.
Ananas: The price of the total pineapple that costs EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 when it was pulled out.
Latva-articoka: The price of EUR 2.60 came to EUR 2.40 when the short stock cut off.
Two treats cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Parchal: The medium-sized broccoli cost EUR 1 and without carrying 80 cents.
End result: If the leaves and positions go off, saves a few dozen cents at best for one vegetable.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables decreased by up to 20 per cent.
These purchases would have saved a total of EUR 1.20!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - the Brass Star signed a five-year deal with PSG
The Brazilian leader Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, says AFP.
Earlier on Thursday night, the representatives of Neymar had paid the FC Barcelona withdrawal price of EUR 222 million to play football in the Spanish league.
The transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was at Manchester United, which paid EUR 105 million last summer from French Paul Pogba.
Spain has previously suspended the transfer on Thursday when it rejected the first payment company of Neymar's representatives.
The company purchasing according to the rules of the league cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out the contract itself, which is done by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and its representatives who submitted the money via the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He may be introduced to a new home audience in the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa explores the details
In addition, Barcelona reported that it would provide information on the payment to Uefa by the European Football Federation so that the Union could determine any disciplinary action arising from the case.
Among other things, Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, has suspected that PSG would break the rules of Uefa's economic fair game.
Uefa can punish a company that loses more than EUR 30 million over a period of three years.
According to Uefa, Neymar's transfer does not automatically break its economical aspect.
Neymar's transfer to PSG affects the company's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players with significant amounts, Uefa was reported.
PSG is owned by State-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former tennis professional, Qatarilainen Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Ten shirts for Neymar
Austin, 21, got the rages burned from the lightning attack - the lightning was stored in the airport's security camera
Austin Dunn was taking regular operations on a plane at the Southwest Florida International Airport with a pair of colleagues, when suddenly from the rain sky the lightning hit the plane.
The force of the lightning was thrown into the land of Dunn, near the wing of the plane.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns around his body.
My father called me and said he had an electric shock and he's in the hospital.
I was just asking if he was alive, Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and brain bleeding.
The experience was hard for the whole family.
You can't wait for that.
It's traumatizing for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on-line at the time of the incident and the transport movement itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3,000 jobs and revives business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British Training Group Pearson announced that it would reduce 3,000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% as a response to the new restructuring programme's pressure on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job cuts are mainly made at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019. The company reduced already 4,000 jobs in the context of the previous structural arrangements.
Pearson announced that he would cut the cost again by £300 million in May as part of his third savings programme, which aims to revitalize a reduced business as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its share of the Penguin Random House to his partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook of the year unchanged. Its turnover grew by 1% in the first half of the year and was £2.05 billion.
Attacked in Kabul: NATO soldier died in a suicide attack
The suicide bomber struck a military incident in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul. According to the authorities, NATO's soldiers were killed and several others wounded.
According to NATO's statement, five soldiers and interpreters were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh area of Kabul.
The explosion is the last violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday, 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people died in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, the Thursday evening explosion occurred when the joint patrol of NATO and the Afghan army was caught by a person carrying an own-made explosive device, as a target of the attack.
The opinion stated that all the injured were stable and were treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the writers, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS Terrorist Organization in Qarabagh are a major concern for NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan, of which 20% were killed in the capital.
At the end of July, the car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul in the area where mainly Shiiamuslims live.
Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people died in a bomb attack in central Kabul, which was the country’s most devastating militant group attack after the US-led forces attacked the Taliban power in 2001.
Violence emphasizes the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send more troops to the country to assist the local army and police.
According to reporters, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly weakened people’s confidence in the government, its pursuit of politics and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
The EPA shall pursue its decision to postpone the implementation of the smoke-free rules.
The U.S. Agency for the Environment (EEA) continued its decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smoke-related emissions during the Obama administration period after 15 states had challenged the law of the Agency.
The EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the 2015 so-called \"consumption\" measures in the late Wednesday, according to the Agency, the decision shows its commitment to cooperation with the states.
\"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states,\" Scott Pruitt said in the statement of the Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced that the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone determinations by one year to October 2018. According to the specifications, the acidity rate is measured in certain parts of the country in order to determine where pollution must be reduced in accordance with more stringent air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the Office challenged 15 states primarily ruled by the Democrats, including District of Columbia, and said that the delay in implementation was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought ways to mitigate the environmental rules of Barack Obama, according to Trump, the measures are part of a broader economic growth programme.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmental defenders who are concerned about the health impacts of increased emissions.
According to the EPA website, breathing air containing ozone can weaken lung function and increase respiratory symptoms, such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person in the lead character of the Isis had also sent the building blocks of the bomb to Sydney.
According to the reservations, the bomb was to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police won't tell us more about why the company stopped.
The second plan of suspected terrorists was to build a device to extract toxic colourless gas and take the device into a spot in a public place, such as a public transport device.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews will continue.
Managing Director of Neste: Renewable fuels did well
Neste’s result before taxes fell, but hit the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievosen, the company did a good result in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products rose to the record level, and the development of the operating profit of the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year’s comparable operating profit improved the U.S. Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Livonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year due to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though tax relief was over.
The implementation of our strategy is going well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will be able to complete our strategic investments in 2017, Lievonen said in the statement.
Nicky Garcia and Vasyl Lomatšenko discuss a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomatšenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing game in the near future of a series of less than 66,7 kilos, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports station in Los Angeles until the WBC’s undefeated lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked along the corridor to greet Lomatšenko, the champion of the WBO’s upper steam series.
Garcia won on Saturday at Showtime with the unanimous decision of the former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner. After that, Garcia and Lomatšenko have been among the top five on a comparative list of weight-class boxers.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and asked, \"How you doing, master?
Good luck in the game.
Lomatšenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on the ESPN channel on seven Saturdays.
When the two posed to the photographers, Lomatšenko Manager Egis Klimas noted that the match between men would be perfect for the chefs.
“I’m a former steam shower, Garcia reminded me.
“I moved the series above [63.5 kilos] for Broner, but I’m not that big.
I'm a small size of 63.5 kilos.
I want to go back to the light series.
He must rise to the light series [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's do their wish.
Lomatšenko agreed.
“Suppression needs this game.
Klimas asked whether the match should be organised on the pay channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomatšenko debyto in the light series later this year and will be taking place next summer against Garcia (37-0, 30 battle wins). Garcia would also be interested in facing the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will take the light series in the Forum on September 23.
\"The match could be on the pay channel because fans have asked for it,\" Garcia said, and later announced she was ready to take a channel that offers the best prize package.
“We are the most interesting names.
No one else will get that much attention.
As soon as I get to the contract, I'm fine.
Garcia said she appreciates Lomatšenko as an unbelieving fighter, and maybe she's going to go see Saturday's match.
Lomatchenko interrupted Garcia's compliment and said that this three-weight master from the Riverside looked like a real slow.
Garcia said he was first focused on showing the force and then boxing.
The men said they felt that they wanted a stronger match between them.
“This is the game that is expected.
No other game will attract as much attention and interest.
I am definitely involved in this case, Garcia said.
Lomatšenko said he was expecting to get to the best. “Mike is a legend.
It's gonna be a great game.
The average salary of EUR 5 300, training what happens - the situation of investment advice was – wild and free –
The quality of investment advice has been discussed a lot lately.
Last, Helsingin Sanomat told Ritva, 68, to which the banker’s investment advisors spoke full of the populace when selling investment products.
The rules on investment advisors and the sale of different investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The tightens are based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will be applied at the beginning of next year.
Currently, the assessment of the expertise of investment advisors and investment firms is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not define the skills requirements.
The Financial Sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in an investment service perform their own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of qualifications for APV investment qualifications Oy, a company with a degree group of experts from both the Financial Supervision (Fiva), universities and industry.
The studies range from 12 to 15 credits, and their exams are developed by Aalto EE, the Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides business management services.
Its website states that, generally speaking, both exams are quite extensive with regard to the requirements.
The study material includes 10-15 books, as well as a number of other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV investment studies Oy, reports that the pass rate of exams is roughly 70.
Most of the staff of the largest banks have completed an APV1 or APV2 degree, as their performance is mandatory according to the company’s own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers without mentioning the names whose staff influences the performance of the mapd qualifications, says Savikko.
He said that such banking transactions are:
According to Savikko, the APV1 degree has completed 13,000 to 14,000 people since 2000 and approximately 3,000 of the APV2 qualifications recommended for the most demanding investment advisors.
Some bankers consider the completion of the degree to be an advantage.
Many other sectors have far more stringent knowledge requirements.
Savik says that the recommendation of the financial sector requires the completion of the APV qualifications, as the expertise in the investment sector is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, on average, financial and investment advisors earn thousands of euros per month, including commissions, natural benefits and earnings.
The average earnings of regular working hours per month are about EUR 5,300.
On average, men working at work earn €5 900 per month and women earn more than €4,500 per month.
On average, the number of earners deserves an average of EUR 8,100.
The majority of men earn more than 9,000 euros per month or more, the tenth of the women who earn the most earn more is 6 400 euros or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
To date, the employee and job levels have been trusted for self-regulation.
According to Fiva, the audit carried out by it received individual cases where the professionalism and competence of the investment advisor were not sufficient based on the work of the advisor.
In principle, as a seller of investment products, it can also work even if professionalism and competence are at a fragile level.
In this regard, the situation has been wild and free.
Many other sectors have far more stringent knowledge requirements, says Savikko.
According to Savikko, from the beginning of next year, the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II) will be tightened.
It requires each company to respond to the fact that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently competent.
In turn, financial supervision may be authorised to impose what needs to be done.
Fiva’s market supervisor Marko Hov says that one of the clear changes to the present is the legislation on the knowledge and experience of investment advisors and investment product sellers.
According to the court, the new requirements concern both investment firms’ own staff and affiliates who sell products on behalf of a company.
According to the Government's proposal by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva may be authorised to prescribe knowledge and experience.
From what they are exactly, it will be decided in this vision during the coming autumn.
The company must also continue to take care of the necessary training and, if necessary, monitoring and further training.
All of this must be documented, and the company has a burden of proof that this has also been done.
The court specifies that, for example, the company needs to map staff’s work at individual level.
This will certainly be the case, depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to the court, a new requirement is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced if knowledge or experience is not at an adequate level.
In other words, if the company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the court, the rules are tightening and concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.

Imatra’s blue beach school students do not have a moment of rain or sun roast - Iines Kakkonen Polski with the help of the swimming pool
Iines Kakkonen went to a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools run in Liete and Lempuka this and next week.
Although sometimes rains and then shines again, young swimmers are not moxiskies, the leader of swimming schools, Tana Ikkonen.
In this week’s swimming skills to map a total of 13 children, next week a dozen.
The next week’s number of children was affected by the fact that the school and the eskar started at that time, it was estimated by Ikkonen.
The Imatra Beach School is organised in cooperation with the Sports Connector project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, the beach of Liette had a nice atmosphere.
The sun shined and young swimmers trained to stay on the surface with swimming bulls, someone already without.
The water also enjoyed smaller sisters.
Ines from Kakko, 5, first thought of going deeper into the water.
Taina Ikkonen, however, encouraged her to kneel towards the beach.
It's going great!
Iines Kakkonen said he had been swimming a lot this summer.
The beach of the list is good for him.
Iines Kakkonen, like the swimfly, practiced the swimming pool with the tightly Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too will be satisfied with the achievements of today, the swimmer praised.
Jami Kallio, 4 times he wanted water wars.
Her daughter Anna Villberg, who followed the 6th swimming beach, Ilona Villberg considers the beach swimming school to be a good start for learning swimming.
Although the weather has been what happens, every day Anna liked to go here.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Swim-schoolers packed up on the dock.
The boys had enough to move along the beach with the found frog.
Milja Luuknen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread to the plant towels, nabbed fruit and baked the day.
In the water, teaching continued, but the dock was not held fast.
It's like when you don't belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet drills – this is a story that connects with the same story.
You see all kinds of it.
The blue product that manufactures cleaning products launched a series of unknown military products a couple of days ago.
I mean, dishwashers and towels, as well as a \"wc brush on the edge brush,\"
An unknown soldier refers to this autumn’s film and film marketing.
However, there is something special in the combination, and the products are irritable in social media: When will the unknown health links come?
I need to call the company and ask what this is about.
What does Vice President Aino Määtta say?
We're a film partner.
We are supporting this movie, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, Mätta says.
According to him, the products will be subject to a specialization, and the film will thus become visible.
Isn't there something funny here - often when you think that the products and the stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, there is such a connecting story that we are a Finnish player and these are Finnish products, Mätta says.
According to him, the company supports the same Finnish values as those who have seen an old unknown soldier.
Cleaning is not a visitor to the military culture, he points out.
Other partners in the unknown military film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
For example, Hartwall's vichy has been brought on the market so far, known as Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unidentified products were already recorded by Perata Finnish Journalist Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the film first night, so there is still a promise to continue.
For example, the Valio, the Processor, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen have not yet revealed their war products.
New results of the Swedish asylum seekers’ age tests were published
The latest results of the medical age tests of asylum seekers in Sweden have been published, and the results of the tests carried out by the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of the tested were determined to be over 18 years of age, but not everyone considers the tests reliable.
The Swedish National Law Office began testing earlier this year.
The tests can be used to assess the age of the asylum seeker in more detail. The new test was introduced after the assessment of the Swedish Immigration Service that it had failed to determine the real age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has so far carried out 6 880 tests, and the Office of Justice has now published 2,481 tests. The tests were conducted between mid-March and end of July 2017.
The 80 % tested, i.e. the 2002 asylum seeker, was determined to be more than 18 years old. In addition, in 25 cases, the U.S. Office of Justice determined that the test was – possibly 18 years old or older –
In 432 cases, the outcome was that the asylum seeker is – possibly under 18 years of age –
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to suspect the age of the applicant.
Johan Göransson, the Justice Agency, reports that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
“The figures are fairly consistent. There are no large differences in the statistics of the previous months, he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were defined to be over 18 years old, it does not necessarily mean that applicants would have lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 results of the test and announced that in 442 there were “incidents that the examination is 18 years old or older”
When Svenska Dagbladet studied the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly announced that he would complete this year for 18 years.
The medical age assessment method used for tests takes x-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of knee joints. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticized.
One of the suspects is the Endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolin Institute, whose work is part of the evaluation of human biological maturity. The evaluation can determine whether a person has had a breakthrough earlier or later.
“I have had reason to think about it, and I believe that the method used is not the right one.
The definition of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t determine age, we shouldn’t pretend to be able to do it, he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, the Agency for Legal Affairs, defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of determining the child as an adult is small.
The risk is the highest in a situation where the test is to be completed for 18 years.
Ilone collapsed 30 places in Scotland
Five more than par results in the third round were spent by Mikko Ilosen on 30 points in the European golf competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left on Saturday on the split instead of 11 but was found at the end of the round at 41.
Ilose grew up with one double of three bogs.
The rest were difficult, too.
An English Ian Poulter rose to share the top place in one of the less par rounds, even though he told me that there was enough work in the umbrella.
Keli was raw, but I hung with him and finally the day was good, Poulter Tuum.
He shares the top-notch with his landman Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
Governor of West Virginia to change party
On Thursday evening, Democratic Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia announced that he would change the party at Trump's campaign event.
“The Democrats simply rejected me,” Justice said.
“Today, I can tell you after many prayers and in-depth reflections... today I will tell the West Virginias that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats.
The public broke out with fresh promotions.
“Today, I registered as a member of the Republican Party, Justice added.
As a coach, I would tell you that it is time for a new game.
Trump previously promised that a major announcement would be made at the West Virginia campaign.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected Governor in 2016, according to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited his father a mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
The value of his property is about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the National Committee of the Republicans (RNC) issued an opinion that \"the political exchange of Governor Justice is again a new attack on a democratic party, which would rather build obstacles than better America\".
“Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice’s announcement is the last setback to a party with no leadership and unable to find a positive message that unites people,\" said Ronna McDaniel, a representative of RNC, said in a statement to CBS’s news.
The lightnings sown the damage - Thursday is coming up to summer on a very busy day
From the end of the week, we can also add more to South Finland.
Over the past week, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomen.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning blows lit several fires.
According to the Meteorologist, Thursday may be a very busy summer.
Ukraine has finally found Finland as well.
Over the past week, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomen.
On the table, the lightning hit the electric center of the rowhouse, causing a small fire.
The rescue facility received a notification of the fire about a quarter of a day until midnight.
The power station was located in the sauna area at the end of the row house.
The rescue facility bottled the roof and wall to find fire extinguishers and cut off the fire smoothly.
There were 11 apartments without electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
On the holiday, the lightning set fire to the exterior building in Harjuland before midnight.
When the rescue facility arrived, the building was already in the full phase of the fire, and the rescue facility could not stop the fire from spreading.
The building of about fifty square meters burned to the ground.
On the way to Kuopio in Räkkylä, the lightning hit the home house.
The people of the house were outside of the building and witnessed a stunning lightning attack.
The rescue facility was there to check the case, but this time the lightning didn't get the fire early - only a few fuses were blown.
In traffic, the thunder caused problems on the train track between the Wall River and Vaasa when the lightning attack damaged the traffic control system.
The information on the error was received on Thursday morning between eight and nine, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was only fixed a little before five in the afternoon.
Since then, train traffic has also been able to continue normally with a thunderstorming rail section.
The lightnings have sown the damage across Finland.
However, it has been relatively little this summer.
This summer’s thunderstorms have been completely impoverished! estimated by the air science facility’s solar-friendly meteorologist, Jar Tuovinen.
In the middle of the week and Thursday, the thunderstorms have been mainly moderate in their strength, but due to the low snowfall of the summer, it also feels powerful.
This might seem really hard, but that’s what it’s been compared to this summer’s thunder, Tuvinen says.
On Wednesday, the landscapes were blinked 1 700 times, and on Thursday there was a potential even for the summer’s toughest thunderday: around 16 a.m., there were 1,790 lands on the plateau.
If it continues on the front side of the evening, it is possible to reach more than two thousand lightnings, Tuvinen predicts.
In 2015, the previous year’s peak peak was reached, with a total of about 30,000 pieces of lightning in the year.
By Wednesday, this year’s amount of lightning had increased to 18,386 saloons.
So it is interesting that this year does not break the two-year warranty record.
However, the Ukkoskir can expect to continue.
During the end of the week, Finland will also remain warm and wet, which is an acceptable birth environment for thunders.
The main focus of the U.S. will be on Saturday from the northernmost parts of the country to the south, where about 2,000 salami days can be reached both on Saturday and Sunday.
In the middle of the country there is a more uniform raindrop.
In such a way, Tuvisen said only a few times.
Coe praises Russia – open-minded – an apology for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the world sports boss, thanked him for describing his apology, which Russia presented on Thursday due to the Doping scandal.
Russian general sports director Dmitry Shljahti said that the World Championships at the IAAF Congress on Thursday, that the ban received by Russia was appropriate and that he was determined to fight the Doping.
He said he was sorry, for all the athletes who were taken to the competitions of gold or hopmedali.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the continuation of the ban. Russia was excluded from the public sports competition in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Office's WADA report presented evidence of state-backed doping in Russia.
“I think his response today was very straightforward, and it was a very open presentation – the President of the IAEA Coe told reporters.
“The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation of Sports admitted the country to the difficult times and announced that it would do its utmost to reorganise its activities.
Coe also said he was “satisfied” that Russia accepted the terms of the ban.
“I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the group’s recommendation that it is not time to stop the Russian ban now,” Coe said.
“We need to do everything we can to normalize the situation in the coming months.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep pure athletes separate from a corrupt system, he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with the status of neutral athlete at the World Championships in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Mr Rune Andersen, Director of the IAAF Working Group, said Monday that Russia still needs to meet a number of requirements before its status can be restored.
“The test is still insufficient, and the trainers who have been banned continue to function freely, he told the journalists on Friday after the IAAF’s presentation to the Council in London.
The company was disappointed in the weak success of Tom of Finland's film
Tom of Finland did not become as successful as the authors hoped, says Yle.
If they are honest, I’m disappointed, confessing that the film was produced by Helsinki Film CEO Annika Sucksdorfff Yle in an interview.
I was afraid the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems to be.
The film received its first night in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached a fair 100 000 viewers, which is a little compared to the film’s budget, about five million euros.
There was no lottery, but now it is important that investors get their own back.
If the film had been better in the country, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for small bites of foreign distributions, says Sucksdorff.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukosken.
How the economic rules of football affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The provisions limiting the use of European football euro do not prevent the transfer of Neymar from Spain from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, France, which is the most expensive transfer of football.
Its possible penalties for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by the European Football Regulatory UEFA, which can prevent the team from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced the financial rules of a fair game, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million for the conclusion of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar's annual salary in the new company is moving in tens of millions of dollars.
Neymar's transfer to France has a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty paying the transfer amount of Neymar and attaching it to its star card, as it follows to fund the Qataran oil-rich rulers.
The clubs are allowed to use large amounts for the purchase of players, but they need to be balanced with real income sources so that the football-related business is not loss-making.
The financial rules of the fair game were drawn up as UEFA chairman of the French Michel Platinum initiative in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini believed that the pursuit of success by indebtedness was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners took their support.
In 2011, the focus of the fair game’s economic rules shifted from the liabilities of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the first time Roman Abramovich’s business model used in Chelsea in 2003 was significantly hampered. Abramovitch bought a promising team, spent huge amounts on player procurement and created a global brand.
The current three-year assessment period of the fair game’s economic rules lasts until 2018. During that period, the consequences will be allowed to make up to EUR 30 million of the loss.
While Platini had to leave the roles of UEFA president scandalically in 2015, his successor Alexander Ceffer also wants to curb the endless use of the funds of the clubs.
“The rules of the fair game are still in use, and we will also apply them in the future, and Andrea Traverso, responsible for the financial rules of the fair game in UEFA, told Associated Press news agency last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a lump sum, it can diversify the amount in accounting for his new contract for the whole period of time.
Neymar has concluded a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual cost of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years.
Based on the economic rules of the fair game, the first sanctions were allocated in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and the Manchester City funded by Abu Dhab.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was also ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors the euro that may attempt to circumvent its financial provisions by increasing its income through companies related to the owners of the club.
For example, if the Qatariian company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal market level, UEFA will not calculate the aid as the actual income.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatarn Tourism Authority to PSG had been overstated.
It has also become apparent that some of Neymar's contributions to PSG could be financed by contributions from the Qatarn World Cup Organizations for the 2022 Football Championships.
However, PSG and the Advisory Commission have banned the fact that Neymar would be made by a World Cup Ambassador. UEFA would be very easy to disclose such a arrangement.
As a result of the previous PSG sanctions, UEFA will follow more closely the company’s rules.
The sources on the site said on Thursday that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG about Neymar's transfer.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on the condition that their identity will not be disclosed because they have no authority to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG’s net sales over the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit of more than EUR 10 million.
The financial statements of the last year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to attract new sponsors and to increase the sales of follow-up products and gaming shirts.
The company estimates that its net sales will increase by at least 30% as part of the Neymar Agreement.
It was said to be a violation of the economic rules of a fair game.
\"This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state,\" said Javier Tebas, chairman of the Spanish League, who referred to the Spanish AS newspaper.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state funding the football club. Arsenal owns an American sports club.
“The death has resulted from the ownership that has changed the football environment in the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
There are so many interests related to the fact that the famous player represents the state.
Now is a hurry: Finnish World Championship coach in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahde and triad Kristiina Mäkelä Coach Suren Ghazaryan are stuck in Helsinki, although he should train for a general sports World Championship in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
The factory will compete tomorrow in a long jump and Mäkelä on Saturday in a three-hole trap.
The two coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this issue in the UK embassy for the results.
The coach has an invitation to the World Cup organizers as a document, but it has not been valid for obtaining a visa either.
Whether this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, Coaching Director Jorma Kemppinen said.
He has always handled visa issues successfully in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Association SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone looks at the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said about the possible absence of his coach.
The World Cup requires a miracle for Finland
The World Championships will start in London on Friday and last for a week after the end of the week on Sunday 13 August.
General sports, terrain skiing and ice hockey are the species for which Finnish bench athletes are passionate about the year to year, whether they are successful or not.
In the heart of the car athletes, success is measured in scales.
Of course there are other meters.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from the prizes, where the experience of gaining the performance of the athlete is developed to the level that the MM scale of adults is truly possible.
Now, the small MM team in Finland has no such young athletes, and not even co-cars.
The World Cup requires a miracle for Finland.
Fortunately, sport’s interest and surprise is that wonders can also happen.
It pulls the bench athletes to the front of the TV box and glue to follow the races, even though the London medals are solved due to the time difference only in the evening.
From the previous World Cup 2015, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by the spear thrower Tero Pikemaki.
Believers expect a long scale now, even though the other will tell him and the other throwers about the results of recent times and the long run in the last summer.
In these competitions, Pikamäki will remain in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
Access to the final competition for other Finnish athletes of competitions or making their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and believe in the realistic medals of Finnish sports in the coming years will give a good success in the international values of young people this summer.
The processing of young talent and the financial support of its work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success will not come in a moment but will require years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope that London's competitions will remain in history as the races of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not for example because of terror or violent attacks.
Before Rukajärvi, second in Copper's big air, but I'm sorry.
The snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi is ranked second in the big air race in Colorado.
Copper Mountain's comet is the best big mouse in the world cup of Rukajärvi.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi raised 147 points in the competition.
He tried his last jump on the caballerial 1080 for the first time in the race, and it was very close to success.
It feels good and good, but it's a shame that the last jump didn't go all the way.
I'm going to try it again in the competitions, Tuumi Rukajärvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from the jumpers for the species.
Viking Line’s new fast ship was stuck at the port of Helsinki
Viking's new long-distance FSTR is very late on schedule.
The ship had to leave Helsinki to Tallinn at 18 a.m.
The ship was loading in eight countries.
The ship was already late in Helsinki.
At least one and a half hours I've been waiting for you to get on board.
Now the vehicle is moving a little, in the port of Helsinki, a waiting Estonian John Rebane told me at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought the new ship had become a technical problem.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought water bottles waiting for their ships.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Grönlund tells IS that there was a technical error on the device.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki for a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed from Tallinn's return trip for a couple of hours.
The ship had to return from Tallinn to Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.
42-metre special transportation interferes with traffic on Kuutos on Thursday night
The 42-metre special transportation moves from Muko to Mukoto to Mustola port during the Thursday night.
The nine departures should be available by the eleventh of the evening.
Police are driving traffic on the Kuutos road, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
Transport from the memory point is moving along the road to the Mustola port.
Small district nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story clashes with both the days of the 80s and the 90s grande (at this time, David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great The State ski show for MTV) and their own time – before 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd, and the other stars of the series moved to larger things in their career.
As a cultural product, it is both a parade and a description of the continuous reminder we have been stuck to during the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have lived in time.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (for example, H. Jon Benjamin’s story of the vegetable market).
The main point of the joke is that middle-aged actors play a part of the impossibility of reaching the past.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: for example, there are 90s of stalker movies, such as horror movies, the Hand that frames.
In one point, one of the characters will dig up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skaters and other stuff from 1991 to 1991.
Many stories are the same as before.
Coop (Michael Showwalter) is now a writer, but still has not crossed Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And in a crazy plot, Ronald Reagan (a.k.a. Michael Showwalter) is a criminal partner of George H. W. Bush (who plays well with Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best are the sidewalks.
It is especially fun to see the iconic Paul Ruddd, who has a beardup under the lower lip, or Matt Dillon's \"soul patch\" from Singles. Andy, a gift of camp, is starting to be an old man.
The moments of accidental madness may be raised to this series as a kind of reservative Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, the group of friends will go to the first night of the Wet Hot American Summer movie.
The Amazon Comrade Detective series again appeals to a different nostalgia: The Americans series, the Cold War, the Atomic Blonde movie, and even the GLOW series, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series has created Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and has been directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made into a Romanian 1980s police drama, where the Bukarist cop fights for truth, atheism and Marxism.
In the main areas of hard-looking Gregorina and Iosephina Iosephina are seen as Florin Pieric Jr and Cornelius Ulici. They have dubanated in English by Channing Tatum (series final producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But that's not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (politics spend time watching TV chess in the same way that Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny. Their bongaining is a fun game.
However, Comrade Detective is too caught up in the imitation of a clump of socialist drama – a killer hiding behind Reagan’s face, for example. That’s why the series often starts to feel clumped by propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough and not heavy enough.
As a result, the series could be better acting as an agitprop-satier, even when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly attend the U.S. Embassy and the lobby, there are always two fat men who eat hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary Communist public is that Western culture can make all consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginative Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we were afraid of our own close history and their history as well.
Kouvolaan Toni Taurus rises on Saturday in the ring in Macau - the former UFC fighter
Toni Taurus wants to keep the game up.
Toni Tauru receives a hard bone in Macau, as the Brazilian Leandro Issa still bought in the UFC organization last year.
The Brazilians also have a jujutsu black belt and a world championship for the species.
One day I'll fight my parents.
It's a funny thing. It's a 32-year-old Taurus.
The Kouvola was supposed to rise in the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was canceled due to logistical problems, but three struggles were brought to Macau on a quick schedule in China's self-government area.
Taurus has never met such a thing before.
This was the first time my fight was canceled.
It was annoying because preparation and training took a lot of time.
However, the contestant is pleased that a new date was reached for the fight.
Waiting for a week does not seem to have much impact on preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition, because it does not improve in a week.
It can get worse if you're exercising too much.
In a few of his previous struggles, Taurus has faced opponents whose strengths are erecting.
This time, the situation is different.
Issa Kouvola is described as a typical Brazilian.
He's a rather aggressive fighter.
I bet he comes in the first round hard and tries to take him to the carpet.
He has won the jujutsu world championship, so he knows the button.
The previous game of Kouvola did not go as planned.
The Philippine Kevin Belingon hit Taurus badly in the eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I’ve never been so up-to-date: he didn’t get hit.
When I went down, he hit my eyebrow.
It was really hard for me for a long time.
New motivation
Some freelancers get once a year, some get up more tightly in the ring.
For example, the future opponent, Isa, had the last time in September.
Taurus had three games last year.
This is the second year's fight ahead.
Sometimes the pace has become pregnant.
I've been training in the past few years and I've been in good shape all the time.
But I've only been fighting for a fight.
When a 32-year-old heard of a future encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was training in Espoo, and I got the pleasure back.
We got really good workouts when there was a guy from Sweden.
The exercise was a great help, because on Saturday, the Kouvolian will be prepared for a physical struggle.
I have been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice a standoff.
Being able is a 32-year-old head tactics.
You have to hit me rationally.
If there's a chance, I'm going to take the place myself.
Low exports must not be given for free, as they consume the most.
Macau attracts Taurus from China before.
They say it's the Las Vegas of China.
I think there's a big and great evening ahead.
The Bank of England maintains interest rates at 0.25%
The Central Bank of England is expected to keep the interest rate unchanged when economic growth has been unpopular and inflation has stopped speculations from interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to slow down. The bank has shifted interest rates, as the income level of the families is under even more pressure.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s monetary policy committee decided to keep the interest rate at 0.25%. The interest rate received even less support this month because economic growth has been unpopular.
In its quarterly inflation outlook, the Bank fell to 1.7 per cent of its 2017 growth forecast and 1.6 per cent of its 2018 forecast. It also warned that more pressure would be placed on the income level of households, as inflation is expected to continue to rise by three per cent in the autumn.
According to the Bank, however, interest rates will be needed in the coming years to curb the inflation that Brexit has accelerated, and the bank also announced that the loan costs could be increased more than expected in the financial market.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw some of the massive economic package, which was started a year ago in the later ads of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme programme in February 2018, although it is expected to provide cheaper financing to banks through the current programme, with a total of £15 million more.
The Bank’s interest rate statement states: “The Commission’s forecast estimates that the slow development of gross domestic product will continue in the next few years, when the decline in real income of households reduces consumption.
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for some tightening of monetary policy in order to curb inflation - the expectations of the market - a little wider -
The market is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and in the second quarter of 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that the possible increases are - gradual - and limited -
In May, the Bank predicted an increase of 1.9% this year and an increase of 1.7% for the next year.
It now held its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The dollar and the euro were reduced as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound decreased by 0.5% and was $1.31. Compared to the euro, it decreased by 0.4% and was EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after the expected weaker growth rates decreased the expectations of interest rates, with GDP rising by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but a little shrinking at the end of the year.
Its most recent inflation survey gave only a little hope of rising inflation and low wage increases to households, and the bank said the situation would worsen before it got better.
The bank added that monetary policy cannot prevent a reduction in income in the coming years, but it expects that wage developments will recover significantly at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by a strong increase in demand for British products as a result of a weak threshold, which will put an end to some of the impact of the reduction in private consumption.
The decision was made one year after the interest rates were reduced to 0.25% after the outcome of the EU referendum, which would fall into the ceiling.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to begin to appear in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Prior to the recent decision by the central bank, interest rates had been reduced to demand more and more voting when inflation exerted pressure on households. In July, the three decision-makers demanded a 0.5% interest rate.
Inflation fell to 2.6 per cent in the last month from 2.9 per cent in June, but according to the bank it was expected and inflation is tightening again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the overcoming of the two-percent target level was due, as a whole, to a weak threshold.
“When considering the recent fall in swap rates, competition in the housing loan market seems to tighten even further when lenders are looking for hot customers and want to end the year strongly,” says Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
“Markinas look especially good for those whose current loan agreement is about to expire. The renewal agreements are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also cost-free alternatives.
NHS prescribes 10,000 anti-HIV medicines
From September, patients can be prescribed a ‘transitional’ anti-HIV medicinal product. The highest right was the subject of a dispute concerning the financing of the medicine in the public health system in England (NHS).
NHS reported that pre-exposure prevention therapy (PREP) is prescribed for approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. Prior to intercourse, approximately 86% of patients at high risk have been shown to reduce the risk of infection.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the court held the Supreme Court’s last-year judgment, according to which NHS was able to pay the PrEP drug, although it claims that it should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS, called the decision announced on Thursday as an important new intervention, and the National AIDS Organization described it as an important moment to resolve it.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield begin first to receive registrations for an experiment that expands to other clinics in October. The experiment reaches its full extent in England by April 2018.
Pre- exposure prevention therapy (PREP) should be used before intercourse with an HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV exposures in risk groups.
Before intercourse with the drug, it means that the body has enough medicines to prevent HIV infection during intercourse.
The medicine can be taken every day or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgenders, as well as people with HIV positive partner who do not receive effective treatment.
The clinics choose the conditions for the experiment to meet applicants from men, women and transgenders and those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and registered to treat a general physician can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs £10 million, and this week, the NHS of England signed a contract for medicinal products after an international invitation to tender.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and implementing treatment.
“This significant new intervention should complement and enhance existing diverse and increasingly effective ways of preventing HIV,” Stevens said.
“This is another major achievement in the fight that has been going on for more than 30 years in order to solve the biggest health challenge for humanity.
“This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,” says Deborah Gold, head of the National AIDS Organization.
“If PrEP is properly administered to those who need it and are at risk, it may have a reversible effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September to September, the risk group will receive a medicine that they can decide independently on without the need to negotiate with a partner. It has an integrative effect that will improve the lives of a very large number of people.
This was a welcome news.
“The most important thing is to ensure that the experiment is rapidly launched throughout the country and no one in the risk group is outside it,” says Ian Green, Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
“The PrEP medicine used in the trial has been obtained and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people from HIV infection.
“PrEP is a welcome event that lasted for several months because of the government’s slowdown,” says Secretary of Health Sharon Hodgson.
“We have evidence that the drug may have a reverse effect on our work that we are doing to prevent HIV and to stop the spread of this threatening disease.
Experience helps us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, thus protecting those exposed to HIV and again getting a step closer to the situation in which the spread of HIV in society has been successfully stopped.
Quality of living: the intermediate layer and smart interior solutions have made a small home of Earl's Court apartment
Former banker Joanne Leigh, who was interested in real estate renovation, moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of the stylish house of Queen Anna's era. The success of the repair is that Joanne has not yet packed and changed her shirts.
“Before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge a much larger apartment,” Joanne says.
I was looking for something similar in my price class.
I went to the apartment screen and found that the rooms were as high as in my apartment.
I immediately enjoyed it and made the offer on the same day.
Since then, about 90 square apartments have experienced a complete change in shape.
It was a double in which the bedroom only reached the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space as well as an intermediate floor so that the room height could be utilized.
I wanted space, big windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands, he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed design office in Notting Hill. Erfan was assigned to use the space of nearly four meters tall rooms and to create an apartment that would not only be a repair and sales destination but a home.
The height of the room was not quite enough for two overlapping modes, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where it could stand.
The solution required Erfan to think creatively.
“The constructions are quite complex.
The premises had to be arranged in such a way that they didn’t need to ride.
The structures had to be modified so that the height was just right both on and below the top of the building.
Erfan was able to place two full-size rooms in the space, with fascinating details.
In the middle layer, the Retrouvius copper-strike window opens in a stylish living space.
Mirrored furniture, silver performances and Serge Mouille's vintage lights create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors leads to theatricality, the feeling of the space and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor appear to be longer.
The mirror in the kitchen space is like a window with a view of another room.
The entrance to mirrored furniture has a storage space for Joanne’s meals and glassware.
Stylishness increases the fact that the kitchen can be hidden when not used.
Kitchens equipped with a cutting door are not a new solution,
But in Joanne's kitchen, it is unique that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
\"It took a little planning,\" Erfan says about a steel-strengthened line-top MDF door.
“It’s balanced, i.e. it slides very easily when it’s raised.
With a robust use of space and storage, Joanne received 16 extra squares, another bedroom and a better base solution.
“When selling, the area solves – or the valuation of the property,” Erfan says.
In the case of an apartment, the real estate broker walks into the apartment and calculates the price on the basis of the surface area.
In Joanne's apartment, the area was added using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the farm.
“The person is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the feeling of the apartment is partly due to them,” Erfan says.
“No one is going to climb to the electrical wiring in the walls.
They are important, but not in the same way.
Joanne's apartment is an example of the fact that good design and accessories can make the basic apartment an exceptionally fine one.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move away from the apartment.
The Pregnant Princess Sofia
The town of Princess Sofia was hit.
Princess Sofia was represented in Båstad, Sweden for the last time before she was born.
The dinner princess at the Sustainable Tomorrow event had chosen a gentle pink dress.
Sofia represented a smile at the event.
Swedish Princess Sofia has visited Båstad, Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia was represented in the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a magnificent blue bodybuilding outfit, which was a wonderfully pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last event in which Sofia is represented before birth.
His time is in September.
For dinner, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastellin blue dress, which landed beautifully.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastellins dress finely as a princess.
Sofia has been in Båstad, Sweden this week.
Sofia is home with a little bag.
Sofia was directly ravaged in her precious summer story.
In the event, Sofia began to talk to the photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said laughing and referring to his rest.
He raised us with a sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, the tower of Lahti appeared home to sell Thai food.
The Lahti did not dare to taste, but walked by.
At home, the food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Pentlä, among the acquaintances of Panja.
He did not know much about Finland, and at that time the Finns did not know the tha.
Because people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free taste.
So he taught the Bayans to eat Thai food, spring roll at a time.
From the countries, he said.
I left the bay on the hook.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened his Thai cuisine in the Lahti shopping hall.
There were two small tables, I think there were less than 20 customers.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to the bathroom.
When you’re hungry and where you’re limited, you can’t leave the empty chair between yourself and the guest.
We got to know each other better, and we became friends.
Finally, I sat next to the board with a dictionary to learn from Thai.
Two years went by the shopping hall, but then the restaurant had to change, because they said the spices themselves would be too in the hall.
At the end of the shopping hall, a new place was released.
There's room.
Now we instigators can sit on our own tables again, only in the most crowded times we have to ask the guests if there is room next to us.
The banker knows his client.
He is told the names where he has been and who he has been seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He has seen how the life stages of customers vary and the food company changes.
He remembers the man I went to eat my first spring roll.
He remembers me lean and fat, and remembers what I was like when I was young.
It’s nice to go to lunch a little later than everyone else, sit next to the kitchen door, and change the appointments with the bar-sucking Panja.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with a sweet chili sauce.
He has also opened our senses and hearts.
Today, many people are talking to him about the Thais - thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always been kind.
He's very busy.
He goes to the restaurant and the blues.
Last week, the restaurant celebrated two decades of fulfillment.
We customers got some strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention, this significant day went by work.
Discovered 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to attack in Europe
From the beginning of the year, the security authorities received an important list of anti-terrorist work.
The list contains more than 170 information from an ISIS fighter who is ready to attack Europe.
According to the German Die Welt magazine, a total of 173 persons are included in the document, including their personal data.
More than 130 of the persons mentioned in the list are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also involved.
They are from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
I told you about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information contained therein have been revised.
According to the magazine, Special Forces of the Iraqi Army found a list of terrorists' personal data and images when investigating a terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them to Interpol.
The list was shared by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
There was a fear that something big and serious would be planned by terrorists in the Western countries if ISIS fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, in addition to the names and images of all people, the list also includes their date of birth, invented tunnels and information about the person’s home country.
The list also includes terrorist specialties.
For example, the German 27-year-old Sami J. on the list reads Abu Assid al-Almani, a German.
He was reported to have left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then through Libya and later Turkey to Syria to join the Isis lines.
His picture is written as a suicide bomber.
There is no more information about the fate of a man.
In total, about 6,000 fighters have left Europe in the ranks of ISIS, whose fate is not certain.
Man fell below the surface of the Tokoinranta in Helsinki
Based on the interviews of the rescue facility, the man had wanted to show that he was able to swim.
A spider can save a drowning spirit.
In the Tokoinranta in Helsinki, a person under water was rescued on Thursday.
Officer Ville Estlander said the situation was over quickly.
The person was found under water about 15 minutes after the notification.
The lifeguard found him under the surface, says Estlander.
The rescue facility received a notice half-four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered in the hands of the first treatment.
Estlander says it was about a 50-year-old man.
Based on interviews, the man had wanted to show that he was able to swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander congratulates the authorities on their cooperation with the Border Guard and the Police.
It was a task led by the Border Guard.
The locals also directed the divers excellently.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two cars were hit in Eura, nine people in the cars, three were seriously injured.
There were nine people in the car, the rest of which got milder injuries, according to a police officer.
There are both men and women among the injured.
The accident occurred at the crossing of three roads four times a day.
Kolari happened when another car turned to a warning triangle behind another car, says the police officer.
According to the rescue facility, the crossing area has a speed limit of 80 km.
Brothers fight over $500 million in real estate
Two brothers argue about Victoria’s largest real estate empire, worth over $500 million. The dispute is linked to their Italian family 40 years ago to establish a family business.
The former president and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives only three houses from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the highest right to dispute the division of property and business property between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the difference.
The brothers and their mother Anna own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, and the family began to collect property when they bought the Collingwood Smith Street street in 1973.
The family was founded there by Westco Jeans, which expanded to 160 movements.
The chain was sold at $85 million in 1999.
The funds were used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as pre-city shopping centers.
According to a contract with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul owns about a third of the company’s wealth. Paul describes his father as the bearative force and the central character of the family.
According to the law documents, the difference between property and property means that Colin owns real estates for about $316 million and Paul for about $176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of property and money.
“I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal,” Paul wrote in his first statement to the court in 2015.
The case was first dealt with in the highest court last Friday after several conciliation firms.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says the claim isn't correct, he blames Paul for the bad treatment of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first oaths that he would like to find a solution.
According to our Italian traditions, the family is the most important thing to me,\" Colin said.
The cost of the case is constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of simple statements, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consultants such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded dairy bars and delicious shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a deal from Brunswick.
They were used as sure as a family when buying a property from Collingwood, which Colin founded the family’s first jeans store.
Colin says he founded a trade class in the last few years when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, dead in 2012, wanted to transfer property to their sons in a convenient manner.
“Luig often said that he didn’t want the brothers to go to court,” Anna wrote in her statement.
The two other sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group business. According to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke 26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are the \"stamper\" of their departure from the financial conditions.
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is a former Australian football league board member and television star Eddie McGuir's best friend in 2015, according to this biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered, and he said in his text message that he could not properly comment on the matter because it is dealt with in court.
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul has decided to challenge me to court and to bring my family to the fight according to the name of his family,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accept his brother’s demands.
“Our father wouldn’t have wanted us to argue in this way,” Colin continued and told us that he would continue to hope that the matter would be resolved.
On Friday, hope seemed to have gone away.
\"We'll be in court in the near future,\" Colin wrote.
Trump's new head of staff intends to limit the media use of the President.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to Poltico, the White House's new chief of staff intends to limit the use of President Trump's media and the monitoring of news so that the boss would not be in trouble so often.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reports:
“When John F. Kelly, the new head of staff of the White House, met with the management staff on his first working day, he spoke about the key problem he was going to solve: he intends to limit President Donald Trump’s access to information.
Kelly told the White House employees that all information, whether printed or heard in the press, must be carried through him because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information.
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media usage and failed.
President Trump has for decades a relationship with television – and as president, he continues to watch a lot of television.
“If President Trump became nervous about unfair news, he was supported by the fact that the helpful media dealt with things more fairly,” Sam Nunberg told the Politico newspaper in February, a consultant at Trump’s campaign.
Politico journalist Tara Palmer wrote at the time that, according to six former campaign workers, Trump’s Twitter use is essential for his personal media flow to be part of a smooth flow of calls.
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that Trump's Twitter use has ever been controlled.
Maybe these campaign workers know something we don’t know – maybe Trump’s tweets would have been even more intense without their efforts.
We probably never know what kind of messages Trump left without sending.
If his staff has been able to prevent problems caused by him even a few times, their work has not been unnecessary.
However, no one has been consistently able to prevent the noise caused by Trump.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House trying to drive their case by providing Trump with information that supports their vision. That information can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that counsellors intentionally give the President a questionable information.
The journalist Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
“Trump’s current and former employees say that he can be immensely angry with newspapers that criticise him – especially if they tell him about harmful data leaks. Then he has to know where the data comes from.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone deportedly gave the president a copy of the article on GotNews.com, founded by online provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused Katie Walshi of several white house data leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and canceled them later. He also did not present concrete evidence.
However, after reading the case, Trump began by asking staff about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then Head of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter had tried to introduce Trump's documentation management system.
And what was the result?
Kelly will try the same three months later.
Maybe he turns out to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulse self and his assistants continue to run their own business.
These unchanging facts make Kelly’s task very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year agreement with PSG
The Brazilian leader Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, says AFP.
Earlier on Thursday night, the representatives of Neymar had paid the FC Barcelona withdrawal price of EUR 222 million to play football in the Spanish league.
The Neymar agreement with Barcelona had therefore been abolished, and he was free to move to PSG.
The transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was at Manchester United, which paid EUR 105 million last summer from French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by State-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former tennis professional, Qatarilainen Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
As a success writer, Raija Oranen said: “I am in good condition for my life.
From the Tv series, the time of Rose and the pure white sheets of the well-known success writer Raija Oranen just spent her 69th anniversary.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren hold their grandmothers in addition to writing that Raija and his husband Jyrki abandoned the Spanish sun and Fuengirola apartment after 18 winter.
First they sold their houses, but now in the spring they also left the rental apartment.
In light and sun, out of the old circles Raijan took depression and alcoholism, from which he survived.
The external nature is also more than 20 pounds lighter.
The weight went down when serotonin medications were stopped, they were mood medications.
I was able to help alcoholism with hypnosis, which also caused fear of flight, I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, the ferocious writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen has been working together for over 40 years.
I asked, and it was a two-week marriage, Raija laughs.
He has always been such a drama queen, stopped his life from that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
The great writer Oranen remembers only the good 44 parts of the Clean white sheets of television series that touched and moved the recession time of Finland.
I finally decided to be the industry of the Rikakka family company when I read on the plane Liisa Seppälä's 50th anniversary.
I was the daughter of the sewing machine myself, my mother also had a clothing shop, and I sometimes acted as a mannequin, Orane remembers.
From him, the story and the story of the series changed the attitude of Finns to entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and dissertation revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer of active time, has many manuscripts under the work - ideas for hundreds.
The tourrs returned to the valley of the millionaires.
The richest owners of West Midlands are once again on the hook with self-painted circulars, who managed to cross the village’s long-awaited yard and return to the house’s next field.
The tourers parked their twenty caravans near a street called a millionaire alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the city’s long-sleeved car. They brought with them children, horses, and the army of vans.
The tours managed to cross the passage point, which had been left unprotected due to the path.
The angry residents have accused Solihull’s municipality of “full inability to solve the problem.”
The unidentified resident says that the circulars came Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown passers through the stone.
“It is hard to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The tours were here in May, then they left but returned again.
They became more and more in the evening, and probably even more today.
The resident said that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
“Asun Streetsbrook Road, and it’s frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can’t do anything about it.
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the circulars returned so soon after they were driven out.
“They’ve been more, and they’ve even dropped a horse to carry it to the park.
According to Solihull's local informant, the municipality is aware of the illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. \"We are taking the necessary legal action with the Solihull Police to get the campers killed as soon as possible.
For the sake of collecting evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible make a notice of disruptive or criminal activity to the police.
It will help to create an overall picture of the situation in order to process justice.
The angry people surrounded Portugal's debaucher
In Portugal, men filled with forced landing have been questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday.
Two men flying the plane can be charged with death.
In Portugal, it can be given 16 years of imprisonment.
A small aircraft flying by men had to make a forced landing on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica, located near Lisbon yesterday due to a technical mistake.
There were hundreds of people on the beach, some of which ran the plane to escape water.
The plane was hit by a 56-year-old man and a 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The machine first hit the man who was on the back machine.
Immediately after that, the plane rose up and when it landed again, it hit the head of the child, said to the newspaper Filipe Janeira Jordan de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
Her parents didn't hurt.
On the beach, the people surrounded the small plane immediately after the accident.
The girl’s father and other people went to the machine and started beating it up, told Celia Rocha Correio da Manha, who witnessed the case.
He called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle that no more people died.
Two men in the plane were not injured in the landing.
The Finnish star who lost his feet tragicly won the World Cup again: “I wouldn’t be the world champion of the accident.
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrates the earliest Wednesday morning Finnish time in the World Cup of World Banked Sloom in the Canadian Big White competition.
The Grand Hamari won the Cross World Cup in the first place.
All the World Cup titles have already been raised by three.
It's an incredible World Cup!
Two times the gold was treated, with a pretty good heart, the water was drawn, and the Great Hamari was happy by telephone.
A 30-year-old calculator thanked his coach and well-prepared preparation in Finland.
According to Great Hamar, the number of challengers in the species is increasing all the time.
The entire parallel board has grown and developed a lot lately.
The differences are decreasing, and there are a lot of new calculators involved.
He always wonders if there's a black horse behind him.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Greater Hamari lost her leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been fervent with his friends since he was young, and the accident did not take the desire to get on the chest.
It comes to mind in time that my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it is useless.
These cards play what is shared, the Great Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to see a serious accident and the loss of the border as a lucky defeat, and the Great Hamari would not do that.
But he turned a terrible difficulty in the interests of him.
I would say that the situation turned to victory.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the biggest ferrying of the 23-year-old Great Hamar was already falling.
To the top of the dome, it was not until after the accident.
I trained as a young man with friends, and we always killed X-Games.
But they were distant wounds that faded somewhat over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself on the X-Games start.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old and I was thinking that this would be a very long life if I stayed here to be bitter and sad.
I decided to pull the hammers into the neck and start working.
I'd say I've been pretty good.
The calculator was very pleased to choose Leo-Pekka Star for a year’s athlete.
The four-time Olympic winner received his prize in the sport industry held in January.
According to Great Hamari, the star's victory is an important signal for the parasports.
It was a big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
This will also open your eyes to the sport world.
Since it's time to launch a two-time world champion Matti Nagy-Hamar's annual sports campaign?
We'll see it in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Still, the Great Hamari has not conquered all of its passions.
Next year there will be a great goal.
A year later, Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
Let's go get the medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war has ended and Isis leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian young people do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Isis from the country are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
Trump's administration does not see a change in the Syrian conflict.
The communication office chain Burson-Marsteller discussed the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying views and attitudes of Arabs in nine years.
This year, a Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the views and attitudes of the Syrian refugees of young people living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 young Syrians aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
42% of respondents might think they would return to their home country and 4% could not say.
According to the study, the young people’s decision to go home will be most affected by the war in Syria and the presence of Isis in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war as the most important factor for permanent home return, while one quarter believes that it would be important to leave the country.
Only less than a tenth will make it the most important factor for the decision to improve the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action does not resolve conflict alone.
The Syrian youth was asked what is the most important factor for the resolution of the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of war is more important than the abandonment of President Bashar al-Assad.
In the fourth quarter, the President of al-Assad is considered to be a barrier to the peace treaty.
Almost half of us feel that we need both political and military solutions to end the current Syrian conflict.
To resolve the conflict, only military action does not believe as a fair quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugees see ISIS’s power weakened in the last year, while the fifth again feels that it has been strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against terrorism is that the media conveys information to people about the fact that ISIS has nothing to do with Islamism.
Almost as many of them took military action and training reform as a priority.
The 10th most important thing is to create jobs better for young people.
When asked about the impact of Trump's administration on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during Trump's administration.
Almost every four believe the Syrian conflict to worsen in Trump’s period.
The views are divided into two ways as to whether Russia and Iran have improved or aggravated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coded to keep the Internet in order - his database is used by Wikipedia and Google, for example.
The Espoon company MariaDB develops the fastest growing database of open source.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by Widenius, will not cost users anything, and can be developed through the Internet by any programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
The databases allow huge data mass to stay in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
“All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there, explains Widenius.
Widenius, a technology leader in MariaDB, spends about half of his time coded.
A man who makes a beautiful hand-to-hand telephony helps to ensure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database with MySQL in conjunction with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL with a billion dollars, and a year later, Oracle was a software giant with a solar 7.4 billion dollars.
When the Oracle trade took place, much of MySQL’s developers announced their departure.
“They didn’t want to work for Oracle, who didn’t give a certain promise to MySQL’s future.
He had already started a company that began to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life to die.
I hired twenty best developers from the Sun, and I made sure that the continuity of the code would be secured with the same friends that created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
The Foundation was established to monitor the freedom of development of the MariaDB code.
“In the course of MYSQL, these assurances were not made, Widenius regrets.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL’s billion trades, few Finnishs know nothing about MariaDB.
“Last year, our growth rate has been about 50% a year,” says Kenneth Paqvalén, economic director of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not yet winning, and Paqvalen is a handful of the company's characteristics.
In the current financial year, she estimates that she will receive orders for EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed the services around it that business customers are willing to pay.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be more than a year’s career if the client has used a closed database.
The switch from MySQL to MariaDB will be successful in the moment because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia DBS are the customers paying by MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in Linux operating systems distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small company, we have connections with the biggest players.
“Our clients include the world’s largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks, and even some central bank, Paqvalén’s list.
The database market is still in place with closed databases such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP.
Even for Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the traditional closed database of the company.
Although, according to Gartner, the largest database companies have lost their market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, the players such as MariaDB are still insignificant, although fast growing seals.
About $50 billion in database markets, open source databases are not up to a billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in money, because most users do not pay anything about these software.
Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies are already developing more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been changed to open or at least started.
Large companies do not receive new customers because most of them choose the open source code next.
This has led to the fact that the license fees for commercial databases have jumped into the cloud.
Companies want to make as much money as they used to be with a smaller number of customers, Widenius thinks.
Since the exchange of a closed database is difficult, the majority of customers have been ingested with price increases.
“There are many customers to whom the transition is really difficult because their old apps and others are closed in the database,” says Widenius.
He still believes that the size of the customers is coming full.
When the license fees rise every year, the customer will move to the open source database sooner or later.
The price is 10-20 per cent of the previous time, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if desired.
In addition, many companies face major system changes when they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a loan of EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide, and is now planning to hire more.
One of the reasons for EIB’s funding was MariaDB’s impact on public procurement.
The company has customers in the public sector, for example in the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros per year from databases.
“Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently,” Paqvalen said.
Widenius is ashamed of how to spend money on closed healthcare systems in Finland, even when open systems are cheaper, and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that the open source code is ideology, but I think it is a better way to make code.
The Community helps and does something that is not invented or capable of doing.
The 55-year-old Widenius is part of another Finnish, Linux developer Linus Torvalds, along with the most famous open source providers.
Widenius helps other companies develop operating business models over an open source code.
I still have 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this topic.
Italy is intensifying its approach to civil society rescues
Italy has warned NGOs who will save refugees on board in the Mediterranean that they must not continue their activities unless they commit themselves to new rules on their activities.
“If NGOs are not committed to the new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to see how they could continue their activities,” said the Interior Minister Marco Minniti, in an interview with the Toronto La Stampa newspaper.
Minniti’s warning came on the day after the Italian authorities had seized a German ship of Jugend Rettet aid, which was suspected to have cooperated with human smugglers who promoted illegal immigration.
Only a year ago, the aid organization refused to comment on the detailed charges of the prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, saving lives is and will be important. We are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area, the organization announced in a statement published in the social media.
“We can only assess the charges once we have collected all the necessary information and we can assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Iuventa platform of the Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken on board Russians by boat refugees directly from human smugglers who were re-introduced.
One such case is claimed to have occurred only a few kilometers from the coast of Libya.
The crew is suspected to have threatened the Italian coastguard, who is monitoring rescue operations in the area, and the motive is to help.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who monitors the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue activities have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save Children and Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
who announced Thursday that they would consider new rules unnecessary but acceptable, because they do not cause significant changes or obstacles to the rescue activities of the organization.
Among those who refuse to follow the Code of Conduct, Nobel Prized Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti, on the other hand, stated that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, as shown by the efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with local mayors to produce results.
“In the last few days, the light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He revealed that the plans will continue this month's discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
A seasonal worker suspected of being killed in Enontekiö, a suspect found in the terrain - a case for the prosecutor
The suspected crime occurred in Enontekiö Ketäs last December.
According to the police, a 36-year-old man in the Czech Republic was suspected to have killed his 26-year-old Scottish open partner.
In the past, it has been reported that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also said that the suspect would have fled with two dogs after his actions.
The man was found frozen in the ground, and did not make the resistance when he was caught.
The charge must be brought within less than a week.
The case may be put in the District Court of Lapland even during August.
Harry Potter and Robert Hardy, a friend of all hair, have died.
British actress Robert Hardy died at the age of 91.
On Thursday, this family announced the death of the actor.
Hardy, born in 1925, began his acting career at the theater at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also played in movies and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered for the role of Magic Minister Cornelius Toffe in Harry Potter films and his veterinary role in the series of all-haired friends' television series based on James Herriot's book.
The BBC's popular series was shot in total through seven.
Michelle Carter was convicted of suicide-inspiring text messages.
The Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls that she was considered to have encouraged her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, will execute 15 months of his sentence in prison and five years of probation.
Carter was convicted of murder in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
\"My family is broken,\" Conrad's father said in a meeting on Thursday.
My son was my best friend.
Carter applied for an amendment to the judgment and was able to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffer from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and cream-colored buffer, listened to his judgment on the cross of a cryful look on the ground.
His actions were killed by Conrad Roy, the prosecutor said to the court.
He decided Conrad's life to improve his own.
He hasn't taken responsibility, the prosecutor continued.
He has not shown repentance.
Carter's lawyer said the case was due to the shocking conditions Carter was deeply impressed by.
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz believed that Carter’s age or maturity and not even mental health problems had a significant impact on his actions.
The prosecutor read Conrad's mother's statement, Lynn Roy, saying, \"It's not a day that I would not die of my beloved son's death.\"
I want him to be proud of me and how I get through all this, and I'm trying to comfort his sister in this pain we're always going to bear.
Conrad's sister, Camdy Roy, told the court that she'd be, uh, just a little embarrassed about the idea that she'd never see her brother's wedding and never be a aunt to her kids.
“It’s painful to lose a person who’s been in my life every day since I was born.
The case seems to be a predicament, because there is no law in the state of Massachusetts stating that it would be a crime to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in the car for bullying in 2014.
The case raised national attention when it turned out that Carter had encouraged his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
“I don’t know, there are many ways,” Carter wrote in many messages that he had sent to Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was at that time on vacation with his family.
Just a little before Roy's suicide Carter wrote, \"You have to do it, Conrad, and you just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy.
Judge Moniz said Carter was paying attention to Roy's death, and the judge ordered that Carter should not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinion of experts.
Only a few people have defended Carter, one of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering his British roommate in Italy in 2007.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox’s opinion in which he says: “Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison.
NATO Secretary General: Between Russia the worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia is clearly deteriorating, said NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
In my opinion, NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we would seek close cooperation with Russia.
But, especially after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and due to continued instability in the Russian East Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to not tightening tensions.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage with Russia in political dialogue in order to avoid a sharping of the situation and a new cold war.
Prior to Stoltenberg’s comments, President Donald Trump found that the US-Russia government had even hit a dangerous bad level.
Trump called on the countries to thank for the poor avoided Congress, which adopted the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi makes changes to the 850 000 diesel engine due to the car manufacturer’s experienced rear impact
A day before Audi’s announcement, BMW offered to update more than 350 000 car software.
BMW’s leader said that the company’s belief was more reasonable than driving restrictions – he referred to European cities, including BMW’s home town in Munich, which considered limiting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that he would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke about the return.
European car manufacturers have heavily marketed diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to meet their CO2 targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to be caused by cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of equipment that neutralise emissions are rising, making it difficult to price cars in a competitive way.
German car manufacturers are strictly monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of being compassion for large car companies and of ignoring problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed in cars a scam device that reduced emissions to compliance with the regulations in tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Several of Volkswagen's leaders have been prosecuted in the United States, but the actions of the leaders are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former director of the Audi Motor Development Department for thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. The authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in their cars that could circumvent European emissions requirements. The prosecution was based on a similar study in the United States.
Audit investigation can significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the share of the winnings of the luxury car manufacturer in Volkswagen is disproportionate.
Venezuela's vote began with a sincere investigation, big protests on the permit.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the election result, the president of the National Electoral Board, Tibisay Lucena, said to journalists.
Maduro confirms the end of the crisis
In Venezuela, in a controversial vote, a parliament was elected to change the constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticized the vote and organised protests against its change.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own protests so that they are in progress at the time of appointment.
According to the El Pais magazine, the national security forces of the country began to take over the parliamentary building of the country on Wednesday evening.
The groups are to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Laventel has become a symbol of the South France Provence region, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender had fallen due to the insects that carry drought and diseases. Researchers and farmers try to find a solution to the problem.
“Lavender is a threat to Provence, because it has suffered from the effects of climate change over the past few years, with the result that the rainfalls in the spring and especially in the autumn have decreased clearly,” says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the PRIEPPAM research facility in Provence, a specialist in agriculture.
This reduces the life expectancy of the lavender.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small cognacs to the area, which spread microbacterials.
The bets are hard.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly desired component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Instead of the long stars and big flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are weakly developed or weakened or are missing completely,\" Chaisse says.
“In other words, there are fewer parts of essential oil.
The solution is applied for by enhancing irrigation, slowing the soil moisture evaporation and spraying plants with a protective mix of clay and water. In addition, more durable varieties of drought are developed.
The murder of a journalist is a growing threat in Mexico.
Once a week, the delivery of the Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the latest cases related to organised crime, corrupt authorities and endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, security is being discussed because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists are advised to change their daily routines.
Two experienced suppliers will discuss which one is safer: leave the children home or take them with the delivery to which a grenade attack was made in 2009.
Security experts have written three words to the front board of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists for names in each group. Evidence is not needed, observations and knowledge are sufficient.
The song is written by the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being in government or drug cartels. They are criminals who make Mexican chaos life-threatening.
According to the Committee on the Protection of Suppliers, at least 25 suppliers have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto entered office in December 2012 in the defence of the Federal State, there are 589 journalists who are subject to attacks and threats. In the current year, at least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, supplier and source of inspiration.
“It’s a huge mistake to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books dealing with drug abuse.
He is deeply missed, even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoc building is covered by a huge picture where Valdez looks like a middle finger. The picture reads: \"Right\": \"The thirty suppliers Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez have dressed in T-shirts, decorated with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has eyeglasses and a trademark made up of Panama.
The meeting will be held less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists will discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and the fears that have become paranoid.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor’s office was set up, in particular, for dealing with journalists’ cases, but according to the Committee on the Protection of Suppliers, only two charges have been brought so far.
Journalists rarely get to justice, as well as thousands of deaths related to drug trafficking and organised crime every year are rarely brought to justice.
Riodoce's suppliers are going to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are breaking grief and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is only a little useful because the killers are not known and there is no hope for justice.
“This meeting is literally a waste of time,” he said.
“We can’t trust anyone as long as we don’t know the cause of the event.
Valdez had left Riodoce in Culiacan, the capital of the state on 15.5.2017.
He had driven only a couple of blocks in his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The number is supposed to be linked to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means two rivers.
The shooter drove out of Valdez's car and crashed it somewhere away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left to death by his wife and two adult children.
The rumors are moving fast and the horses are free in Culiacan.
However, the death of Valdez is a mouse.
Sinalo has been the bloodiest combat fields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
In the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot to death every day, and the cemetery has decorative two-storey tomb buildings that are bigger than many homes.
In a coastal state, there is a “peaceful” – when only one cartel controls ports and drug trade routes in the United States.
Although Valdez was very aware of the dangers of his work, founder and director of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty of being unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce released the Damaso Lopez interview, leading a rival group that goes to war against the Guzman boys.
The case could irritate Guzman's sons: the customers suspected of being a member of the gang bought every number of the magazine as soon as the newspaper came to the point of sale.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published in the same case was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer be afraid of him.
He had done a long career in Noroeste when he decided to set up in 2003 with five colleagues in Riodocen. The magazine shares were sold at that time for $50.
In Sinalos, it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with a drug problem,\" Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to feel about its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
The journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish a hard-class research journalism without fear of censorship, and the readers encouraged the journals that no one else dared to publish.
After eight years of its creation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for his news in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Prize of the Committee on the Protection of Suppliers from his courage to monitor the history of the Mexican drug trade without being sensitive.
He admitted that he was openly afraid.
“I want to be able to continue my life,” he said when he received the prize of the Committee on the Protection of Suppliers.
The drug trade is in Sinaloa – the way of life – Valdez said in an interview with Rompevito TV last October.
“The editor must accept the role that falls upon him – or play stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me where I was when I was sown here, why didn't I tell you what was going on?
Riodoce staff needs Valdezia – a joker who cursed like a port worker. They need a friend who always gets a hug and advice. They need a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routines.
He used a bank hat all the time.
He went to the opposite El Guayabo Bar and was always sitting on the same table.
Now they ask if the routines came to his fate.
The death of the colleague has also made them wonder how they can best do their job and stay alive.
“The criminals don’t like the fact that we’re dealing with their women and children and their clean business, their secret drug trade runways.
They were left out of business, Bojorquez says.
In the best case, it meant strong self-denial and self-defense,
Trusting in your own instincts.
If you feel that everything is not right, you have to stay away.
The problem is that Riodoce's journalist Andres Villarreal says that \"the impression can deceive, and that's what happened in Javier's case.\"
The old rules no longer apply to Sinaloa, nor do they apply to Tamaulipass, Verbruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce’s safety training was held. A few days earlier, it had been revealed that only the spy programs sold to governments had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had applied for protection against the shadow of the tree from 40 degrees of heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce offices located in a four-story building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some of the journalists counted half of their players, whether these two police officers belonged to the 50 percent that the governor of the state did not consider reliable.
It had been months since the journalists had visited the mountainous countryside controlled by drug gangs.
This week's delivery of Riodoce outlined three main things.
The brother of Julio Cesar Chavez was killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government’s money use was concentrated in the governor’s home town.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block away from the Public Prosecutor's Office, was a group of people kidnapped.
There was no official information about it, who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in favour of both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out from public documents that the restaurant had been registered with the names of the political party (PRI) of the dominant institutional revolution. PRI has been managing Mexico’s policy at all levels for almost a century.
The governors who have recently been accused of corruption in many cases.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about previous cases in the same place. In one of them, the \"El Chapo\" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid the army race.
A few months ago, readers would have known that they would have received reliable information about Valdez's column.
\"Before we knew what had happened,\" says the 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been given the nickname \"El Flaco\" because of his gentle body structure.
“Now all our connections to our data sources are broken –
Valdez's workshop has been transformed into a warehouse that maintains anti-povernance signs and stickers of journalists. The newspaper workers have received a new, unexpected task: they have become activists for freedom of press freedom.
The journalist, Miriam Ramirez, took a few signs with him when he left the next morning to represent the local Public Prosecutor's Office for a protest that was again the cause of the murder of a new journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michigan three days after Valdez's murder.
After the disappearance, a burnt body was found, based on DNA tests carried out by the authorities, Adame.
Journalists have started to protest more loudly throughout the country. In demonstrations, the \"SOS Press\" texts appear on the sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to obtain international support for the Valdez case.
On the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they were telling the truth.
He has since asked that he be removed from the government because he is concerned that his anger cannot be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists were surrounded by organised crime, criminal authorities, and an uninterrupted society.
In the last book, Narkojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed by the orders of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to Article 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were caused by police and authorities.
“If people are silenced by killing,” Ramirez says.
The murders have a devastating effect.
No one forgets the death of a blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the north of the border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body had a message signed by Zetas Cartel: “I am here because of my writings.
Next to his cut-off head, there was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the magazines have decided to stop their activities, such as El Norte newspaper in the north of the Chihuahua border state after the Marvelous murder of Miroslava Breach.
Some of them continue to operate like Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to the drug maps on its front page: “What do you want us to do?
Some suppliers have fled their states or the whole country.
The decision is difficult.
It’s hard to find work in exile, and you have to be careful all the time.
Sometimes criminals seek the journalist’s hands, as apparently happened to the photographer Ruben Espinos, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had fled Vera.
For those who continue to work, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, from which I was to become a poet, admits that writing about drug trafficking is scary.
“I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell,” he says.
A while ago, Riodoce's suppliers sat on Friday night in front of the delivery on the sidewalk of the beer when the magazine's latest number was finished.
In the shooting between competing gangs and security forces, 19 people were killed in Mazatlan's beach crash.
The war was accelerated, as was promised in the maps found in the area.
Suppliers put the news on Riodoc's website with their smartphone on the sidewalk.
We had to re-enter the front page the next day.
The sirens were in the vicinity of another shooting.
Bojorquez glanced at the delivery of security officers:
If they were scared, they hid it very well.
Riodoce's delivery continued the magazine's murdering founder's tradition under this massive portrait, where the man looks like a middle finger for the whole Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says that you can't even consider stopping the activity. \"How can I stop the magazine when our trainee asked me to go to the street to do the thing on the same day that Javier was murdered?
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge blow-off.
Hannu Manninen, who was 39 years old in April, remained short because the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympics.
However, the exercise period began catastrophicly when Mannine became infected with the flu.
It started a long period of disease that took nearly five weeks.
May practically went completely ill.
First, it was flu, and finally childhood disease like ear inflammation, which I had to eat an antibiotic course.
I was able to do only 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been so sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I didn’t get a utilized internship, Manninen tells East Sanom.
Test result collapsed
The world champion of 2007 was given a training permit only in the second week of June, which appeared at the Competition and Excellence Research Centre in KIHU on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis with rollers on a carpet, which is raised at speed every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a sample of lactic acid from the fingertip of the athlete with the needle.
Last fall, I was on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
Fire against the wall, Mannen says.
In the right direction
After subtitles, Mannen says he remained healthy.
I have performed a wide range of peaceful aerobic exercises that have tried to normalize the body’s metabolism.
Now it's a really good five-week period.
It also took about a week and a half to leave the airport.
I also had time to go to the cabin with my family.
During the last season, Manninen participated only in four world cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was seen immediately in the opening competition, when Manninen reached the top 18th.
Directions drawn
Main coach Petter Kukkonen has made a training and competition plan for the continent and the national team until February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm compared to the last season.
After the first race, Ruka would have a three-world cupboard weekend.
In December, it would be at least one weekend of world cup, perhaps Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans would still be in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, the name will be found on the Olympic team list, Mannen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would already be the sixth Winter Olympics of the career.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy in Salt Lake City in 2002 in the gold team competition, celebrating the Nummel subline.
Dinosaurus protected against its enemies by masking
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
The researchers have now revealed the first research results of a creature of the size of the horns found by the Canadian miners, which had remained so well-known that experts call it the Mona Companion of dinosaurs.
It had remained so well that researchers could even determine that its Finnish skin was red-brown and had had a problem with the past.
According to Current Biology, it has been the best-preserved dinosaur in all time and representatives of its best species in the world.
The recently found fossil is a nodosaur, which lived at the middle stages of the alliance 110-12 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil as a truly significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, the vegetable eater is the best preserved fossil in its species.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in North Albert Canada on 21 March 2011, and was a mining man named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn’t seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to explore his findings more closely.
The fossil found in Kallio was sent to the Royal Palace of Tyrrell Museum.
There, the beast was dug up for six years from a 100-pound lock-up.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
\"If you squeak your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping,\" says researcher Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Thyrrell.
“It remains in the history of science, the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Skin studies found that dinosaurs eating meat were likely to pose a major threat to this vegetarian, although it had a armor and it resembled a walking tank.
Its red-white armor masked it from predators, and it was also protected from darker and darker coloring, still occurring in many animals.
According to experts, it was so much better to mix with its environment and avoid enemies, bigger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaur rose to the headlines in May, and is now shown in the Royal Palace of Tyrrell Museum.
Researchers have named it Boreelope, according to Mark Mitchell, a brandmitchell museum designer. Mitchell belonged to a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig dinosaurs.
Nodosaurs have remained so amazing that Mitchell and the international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body’s veins and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a general coloring, where the body is darker and darker.
It was still a surprise, because Boreelope is significantly higher than the current animals with a similar coloring.
It can be concluded that dinosaurs eating meat polluted it to the extent that evolution favors as a means of survival to hide instead of fighting.
For example, modern animals, peuros, seropros and scaradillos have a similar coloration. They are significantly smaller and therefore easier catches, indicating that nodosaurs were seriously threatened.
“The big, heavily armored dinosaur catch tells me how dangerous the dinosaurs of the alliance were,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds of Nodosaurus salts reveals that its skin was red brown.
Scientists continue to study nodosaur in order to draw conclusions from its life. Among other things, they examine the contents of its intestines to find out what it ate with its last meal.
Scientists believe that when they died, it fell into a river and ran to the sea where it sank on its back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as today in Florida, and the rivers and seas were likely to go much further than today.
“This nodosaur is very important because its Finnish skin has been preserved and has also remained three-dimensional in its original form,” Brown said.
“That’s why it looks almost the same as early accession.
Its definition does not require a lot of imagination: if you blink little eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping.
The period of accession was the age of the Teropods, the vast two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king Tyrannosaurus rex, that is, millions of years earlier from Boreelope, its great predecessors may have been able to catch this armored dinosaur.
Tyrannosaurus rex’s predecessors included, for example, Acrobatosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 meters long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in the Current Biology magazine. They believe that Boreelope was flushed into the sea after his death and mumminated into the mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in North Albert Canada on 21 March 2011, and was a mining man named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it has been the world’s best-preserved dinosaur with skin and panzers.
The Nodosaurs were on average 5 meters long and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
They had two half-metre peaks.
Researchers believe that this armored vegetarian passed through the current West Canada until the flooded river carried it to the open sea.
Its armor has kept small details in a underwater tomb.
Its fossilized remains have remained so well that its skin remains in the piled plates along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such a preservation is “one of the rarest than a lottery win.”
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
Its skull-panzer slabs continue to contain fossilized leather.
Its right edge is on its side, five toes up.
I can also calculate the air on its foot.
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Who is the street?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier from his home in St. Louis and sat in his airbnb apartment with his bed on his Facebook phone.
Then he saw a message from his fellow readers:
“Police just killed an 18-year-old, and her body is still on the street.
As he was shocked, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information in his feed, which is why he closed on Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had a number of retwicks from @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to the rapper in St. Louis, who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death. White police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson Missouri State.
This user had also posted a photo of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
This is incredible, Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he returned to Twitter later that night, people were told to gather on Canfield Drive.
The users posted pictures of police shut-ups and screaming people, and Brown's father-in-lawed man, who was on the sidelines, read: \"Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son.
Ferrell followed a real-time video photo where the police stood in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He also said he saw a video where the other police shot his rifle and shouted, \"I'll kill all of you... animals...
\"This is not normal, Ferrell remembers that he did.
“It wasn’t the kind of murder we’re already used to and could be said typical.
That's when I felt cold colors.
I was angry and crying.
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from his father, and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
About what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years, a documentary entitled “Whose Streets” was produced. It was first-time film theaters on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and expression of mind, love and loss, and strength and strength from the point of view of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards the Ferguson flora and his daughter dressed in a compatible crown, they again had a conversation about what it was like to live in black and where they had spoken about it countless times before that morning.
“Do you remember when I told you how black people had to fight for the things they believe? Ferrell remembers his words to his daughter.
\"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right.
I couldn't miss my daughter, Ferrell told me later.
“The events of today are... the culmination of past events.
My daughter has the right to know it and to grow into it.
He must be able to act and organize, but he also needs to be known as a black person for the different layers and conditions of the experience of living. And he must know what we must do to release, to release ourselves.
Fortunately, although I have been able to protect him from dirty racism, he is still similar to other black girls.
I feel like I would harm him if I were to protect him from reality.
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, which is located opposite the police station. It became the camp of activists when they were expecting information about the case and eventually became aware that police would not be charged.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and shared them with protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take action in a new way.
\"Aktivismini changed completely after August 9th,\" he says. When studying at Missour University of St. Louis Ferrell was the chairman of the organization of medical students belonging to minorities. At that time, he focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
Something just happened...
Weeks later, Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, the assistant director of the document.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrarran simply wanted to tell us what was happening.
Ferrell's mind is a little bit suspicious, and he asked, \"Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story you can use for good?\"
In the background of the suspicion, they were countless times when people appeared in the local community, usually white people who just wanted to benefit from its difficulties and tightness.
“We had heard that the people who were born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice,” Folayan recently said in an interview.
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis, who is known for his activistism in the prisons of death.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project in conjunction with six other locals. The description group followed the events of Brown's shooting in the following years.
“This is not a document in which someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak,” Davis said.
“The most important thing to me was how local people are being presented in the movie, because I’m being presented in the same way.”
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell, because it was wanted to show that it was not a charismatic leader, but a community – Ferrell proved to be more transparent.
This is why the document sees surprising private aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as love and marriage.
“I felt pretty naked when Ferrell laughed at what it felt like to see the movie for the first time.
“But I realized that this work and the human description of blacks require a certain vulnerability.
In addition, the story of Ferrell once again brings back the middle-night Black Lives Matter role in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement are identical to the quer identity.
“The leadership of the black queens has kept the whole movement,\" Ferrell says. “It’s because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
The black queens have endured everything.
Folayan agrees: “It is true that black women, among whom there are many queen women, are maintained by the movement.
However, he points out that Ferrelli was not selected for the document, for its own purposes, because of his quer identity.
\"He's got energy moving,\" Folayan says.
“It’s not a coincidence, however, that she was in the front line. The black quer women live in many things at the cutting point, and they have a lot in the game.
His energy comes from a white cloth.
News groups have been leaving Ferguson a long time ago, but the community and the police are still tense.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of probation, and he was convicted of blocking the highways in protest.
His description of the social policy atmosphere of his home corners is short and central: “Sexing –
Yet he still trusts in the slogan he learned outside the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
We have to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains.
Suitable consistency: the artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman gallery, located in New York, has been hung in the middle of the exhibition space with a face – white, black and brown faces, between which you can see the sameness in more detail.
These 30 works are portraits made by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples of Fort Leavenworth's prison in which he executed his 35-year sentence. Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
The Dewey-Hagborgin A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2.8.2017.
It has two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art. Manning is a trans- and groundbreaking dissident whose prison sentence Barack Obama alleviated his term of office for the third day.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning’s DNA from its algorithm and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are sharp, though a slightly theoretical stance on DNA data editing, multiplicity, and the underlying causal relationship and identity of interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, a birth name named Bradley Edward, has openly told women that she has been in contact with her since the break-up. She was found guilty of 20 crimes in 2013, including the violation of the law on spying, computer fraud and theft.
The manning in prison was only one picture: a bright, black-and-white selfie, in which a damaged-bodied manning sits in a car in the driver's seat. He has a plate-armed backpack from his head, which became his sign.
Dewey-Hagborg had a major popularity behind him for the Stranger Visions project, which he carried out in 2012.
In it he created portraits based on criminal data. He received DNA data from, for example, tobacco scenes and chewers and created images of what the people involved could have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
\"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their conversation,\" Mr. Bowey-Hagborg said at a new exhibition.
He could not visit Manning and could not be photographed in prison, so the magazine contacted Chelsea and asked if he would be interested in making Manning a DNA image.
The artist and his captured wall suddenly became correspondence friends, and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even made a Suppressed Images series, pictured by Shoili Kanungo, a future in which the president would have alleviated Chelsea's sentence and he would be able to see the exhibition.
In reality, Obama reduced Manning’s sentence only a few days after the publication of the comic book. It was a lucky coincidence after seven hard years in the National Military Prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened just now, when Donald Trump is fighting his own war against intelligence leakers and transgender soldiers, and he still finds new ways on Twitter to strengthen those powerful dubious times he actually had to alleviate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that everything has its purpose.
The gallery's wall has an artist's statement, and under it, the great title of Manning, where the heart of the last name i is the point. In his opinion, the artist requires the end of the automatic division based on sex, race, sexuality, and culture.
The opposite wall has the Manning DNA sequence: the long line of C, G and A written on the lead pen.
This 200 letter – or nucleotide, as part of the scientific definition used by the artist – is a combination of Dewey-Hagborg who wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
“I hope my show will help people realize that we are equal to our genetic tradition and that genetic data is very personal and transparent to interpretations,\" he says.
“DNA tells countless stories. There are 30 of them.
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: the page from the cartoons of Manning and the DEWEY-Hagborg.
In it, the character of Manning rises from prison like King Kong, in his hand megafoni.
\"If they get you down, they've won, they'll read in the picture.
“Don’t ever be silent.”
“The paper is from a letter I received from Manning, an artist from Philadelphia.
“It’s so impressive that I’m still getting cold colors.”
Unlike those described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he was greeted with his own genetic data-based faces as a group of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is purposeful, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, the Manning DNA period is written on a pencil pen to a height that is the same as its length (157.5 cm).
“The cats were on the wall before, but I wanted to bring a crowd of people to them,” says Bowey-Hagborg.
“I wanted to describe Chelsea’s mass movement, which was also behind his release.
Professor of Northwestern University and employee of Oxford University are sought for murder as suspects
Police say they have launched national searches to find a professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
The documents of Cook County Law show that the arrest warrants were issued on Monday from Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of being involved in the death of Trenbolone H. James Cornell-Duranleau. The arrest warrants have been issued for the murder of the first degree without the possibility of being released from guarantees.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleaau, 26, died after he had been stabbed several times.
According to the local news published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2007.
The police alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple wounds in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleaau was found dead at the scene and stabbed as a murder investigation, and the police actively seek two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Vice-President Alan K. Cubbage, responsible for the University’s social relations, said in an opinion sent by e-mail that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from access to the campuses of the Northwestern University.
“This is a criminal matter that the authorities are investigating, and the Northwestern University helps in the investigation,” Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as an elder in financial management at Oxford University.
The statement sent by the University and Somerville College in an email states that “we have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to assist the U.S. investigating authorities in all possible ways.
In addition, the opinion stated that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and hoped he would surrender.
Director of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglimeli, said that he was asking suspects seriously to surrender to the authorities.
“Police has an idea of where they are, and we keep checking our searches,” Guglimel said.
According to Guglimel, local, regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects.
He told the police that he had received a call from the master of the Grand Plaza building, which had been given an vague indication that something had happened in the apartment.
The police described the sight at the scene as terrible.
It is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told the security cameras that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
\"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair,\" Guglimel said.
The Grand Plaza Management Team published to the residents the following statement: \"It would be necessary to investigate the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence,
He threatened to blow up Islamic bookstore and kill Muslims in London
\"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic,\" the convicted said to the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of his threats to destroying the Islamic bookstore in London and killing all Muslims.
According to Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of, among other things, gross harassment.
According to the police, the bookstore's staff alerted them on May 23th.
According to staff, the man was, \"he was afraid to blow up the bookstore and kill Muslims.\"
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police about the threat.
The threat was not related to the events of the bookstore.
The authorities found that Moffatt had dressed in the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore, the police spokesman said.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt told the police in interrogations.
As a punishment, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay £620 for legal expenses of around €690 and €85, i.e. around €95 for victims.
According to Scotland Yard, several hate crimes are not reported.
“We will complete the actions under the WADA road map in the near future – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitally Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the activities under the World Anti-Doping Office's WADA Road Map, which will restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission RUSADA.
“One of the measures in line with the road map has already been implemented and RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UKAD Commission on Anti-Doping.
WADA's road map has been updated in this respect,\" Muko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for the return of RUSADA's mandate. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything worrying about Russia.
Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future – but Mutko added.
However, one of the road map points requires Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the results of the study by WADA, Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.
Muko said: “The study is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programs, and we cannot admit something that did not exist.
The Mutkon said that there was a echo of the opinion of the President of the Russian independent public anti-doping committee, Vitally Smirnov.
Formerly speaking to the Russian RSport sports media, Smirnov admitted that there were problems in the Russian anti-doping systems.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally, but he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015, when the Doping scandal was revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to design and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
The director of WADA Olivier Niggli visited the RUSADA headquarters in Moscow in July. After the visit, he stated that the organization was “right on the road” towards the restoration of powers.
The British Organization for Sceptical Innovation for Finland: Health Benefits of Maternity Packs - There is no evidence -
The British organization doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
Among other things, BBC and Guardians say that the Lullaby Trust organization fighting for hand-held death prohibits the use of their own brochures in the package of motherhoods in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packs to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some regions.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity package reduces the risk of death.
The death of a child means an inexplicable sudden death.
Lullaby Trust works as an expert in British health authorities in the safe sleep of the child.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed with them because it would allow us to understand that we recommend this product, the organization informed.
Finland is one of the world’s lowest number of children’s deaths, only two dead thousand borns.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is a result of many different reasons, such as a low number of teenage rapes.
The fact that every family is given a box may be one factor.
However, you can’t say that, Mr. Lullaby Trust’s CEO Francine Bates said.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and cached deaths.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention, and it has been given to all mothers in Finland for free for 80 years.
The packaging includes a variety of items, such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes distributed by it meet all security standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard as a place to sleep for cardboardmakers.
According to Lullaby Trust, packaging can be the best alternative to bedtime if there is no frame or floor bed available.
The organization recommends using the pack only for the sake of day-to-day sleep and to stop using it at the time the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of packaging and ensuring that they do not get wet or dirty.
Vikkelä kun escaped for a second Japanese zoo
The Japanese zoo staff is looking for a runaway turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at its speed and already escaped for another two weeks.
The turtle escaped from Shibukawa Zoo in the west of Okayama on Tuesday morning.
The security cameras revealed that the frog left the zoo through the main entrance.
It won’t die right away because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we’re very worried about the Yoshimi Yamane who works at the zoo.
The 35-year-old herd is female, 55-pounded and about a meter-long.
Yamane describes the furry as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the frog can travel freely in the tarka area.
The zoo has not received sightings from the turtle.
The last carousel of the house happened in the second week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 metres from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help you avoid Uber's mistakes
Amy Mettett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her online shop start-up company, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys were anonymous, some employees were suspicious of them.
“The survey was simply not consistent or objective,” says Krett. As a hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on online commerce. The company has 75 employees.
You decided to resort to external assistance.
The market has become more and more new types of personnel management startups, helping other companies to find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement. Companies can make surveys and target them to certain teams and groups of people, as well as provide anonymous reporting services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with the senior management by government.
“My own health can be monitored by applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where you stay in Fitbit, you ask the founder and CEO of the Glint label in Redwood City. Glint offers companies analytics software to measure employee engagement.
This has been using Glint’s software for three years, and he tells us he had a more profound view of the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program can make quick surveys and votes for certain teams. In addition, it can draw up a map of which you can see at a glance at which departments are the most dissatisfied and who the managers have received the weakest reviews. Based on these, Kreitt has been able to drill into the core of problems.
Companies have understood that they must monitor the culture of the workplace so that they do not become the next Uberia. Around the transport company, the former employee has died since he wrote about the culture in his blog, where workers are harassed and punished for their problems.
For startups such as Glint, such neglect is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry, the value of which, according to the Let's Talk Payments website, can rise to over $118.7 billion by 2020.
The Convercent in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate use. Interest in the company grew earlier this year, when Uber's reputation experienced a crash.
Convertent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It recently signed a deal with Uber.
Like Glint, Convertcent allows companies to make customized surveys, collect answers confidentially in real time, and map problem areas.
In addition, employees may communicate anonymous behaviour by means of an anonymous text message.
And if there is reason to doubt the manager of the matter, the complaints will go directly to the company’s government.
“The general opinion has been rejected by the authorities,” says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He recalls that if the company treats its employees badly or works in an ethical way, the consequences can become costly, even if the authorities do not interfere with the matter. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose the employees and be challenged by the court.
The Ruby Tuesday food chain has more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations. The company has used Convertcent for more than a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and can easily connect to the headquarters.
In the past, the practice was that if the employee wanted to report the problem, he first had to find out the phone number or email address, which was able to make a notification to the headquarters. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
\"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience,\" said James Vitrano, the legal director of Ruby Tuesday, who said it was difficult to follow the complaints made by employees.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders in another city or state, and problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and treated faster.
“I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the reality of the employee,” Vitrano says, leading the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
The same way we protect our shareholders from legal proceedings related to employment relations.
According to Quinlan, companies began to view ethics, values and employee commitment even more seriously after Arthur Andersen collapsed in the context of the Enron scandal.
Only through social media did companies realize that they could no longer prevent the public surveying of their slippers.
“The hope was used before technology came to the control of ethics,” Quinlan said.
Glint and Convertcent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for use.
It is a business model and opportunity accepted by capital investors, both by Glint and Convertent, supported by capital investors.
In February, the Convercent raised $10 million funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised a total of $47 million in capital.
In November, Glint received 10 million euros from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investments are not a surprise, taking into account the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their jobs.
In competitive markets such as the Pii Valley, good wages are only the beginning of interesting projects.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a truly useful company.
“Workers are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding,” said Nina McQue, CEO of LinkedIn, who is responsible for the remuneration and well-being of employees.
Investors get a profit when companies succeed. Companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is no wonder that they are interested in investors.
According to experts in the workplace culture, information on employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if, on the basis of it, no measures are taken.
If the company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered as a sign of change.
And if change does not come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
“If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be prepared to conduct four thousand discussions,” says the CEO of the Management Consultant Kotter International, Russell Raath, who has seen companies rely too much on collecting information.
“If the company does not take action, the workers will begin to wonder if they will be heard.
and whether their opinions matter anything.
If the company doesn’t care about them, why should they care about the company?
According to the report, Madison Reed is currently conducting a monthly survey of personnel and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as reported in Glint.
After collecting feedback from those who were frustrated with decision-making slowness and quality of communication, Milttt was able to make changes to the teams and organise communication training to resolve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help to improve the sustainability of staff in the long-term sector, known as the high change of workers.
If the company is not committed to creating a culture of transparency, it loses employees,\" Vitrano says.
If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
Without customers, there are no companies.
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of concealing his naked female neighbor, says the news agency TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at home when she had noticed her window outside of a cell phone hanging out of a woman's head.
According to the woman, the cell phone camera photographed the apartment.
The woman who was scared of the case had run into another room to dress up.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but it was laid soon after that.
A 20-year-old man who has admitted to film a woman.
However, he claimed to have only photographed the face of a woman.
The video on the keyboard was deleted, and the police had failed to restore it as evidence.
In the interrogations, the man has admitted the act, but he refused to commit a crime.
The man in his shooting was justified by saying that he loved his neighbor as a madman.
According to the U.S. News Office, the man is accused of the case.
Teachers Need More Liquid in Autumn Negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than in the export industry, for example, but the difference should be narrowed,” said Olli Luikkainen, chairman of OAJ on Thursday.
The temporary cuts in public holiday money highlight the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements in which the examination would not have involved any kind of holiday cuts.
In the municipal sector, contracts will be concluded only after the private sector's papers have been signed and the increase rates will be clear.
Luikkainen predicts that, for example, OAJ’s working conditions have been agreed in January.
The percentage targets of Luke have not yet been revealed.
Luikkainen is also the chairman of Juko, a public-trained negotiation organisation.
Lukikkainen: Lomahahaikkaus adds career differences
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show a deterioration in the purchasing power of public sector employees while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luikkainen, a temporary holiday cut is a steeper field of occupational development.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many students per teacher can be
In addition, OAJ points out that the equality of basic education must be ensured, because the differences between the best and the weak are growing all the time.
According to the organization, learning outcomes are deteriorating, and differences between students and regions continue to grow.
Bruins’ Day of Players was delayed when the NCAA reduced daily exercises to two.
It's almost 11 o'clock in the evening, and a group of UCLA American football players have stayed to talk about the campus on the other side of the new training fields.
Some have stripped their game shirts, and their backs shine out of the sand after the first day of the exercise camp.
For many of them, this few minutes of conversation is a noon break.
After three hours of training, the students of the University’s summer courses will return to the apartment to read the final tests. The next morning, they will meet at the Wasserman Football Center.
\"The next three days will be hard for these guys,\" says coach Jim Mora, a little earlier than Monday.
The university’s roofing organization reduced the number of daily exercises by two. The purpose of the change was to reduce the number of players’ work, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final tests are held.
That’s why UCLA’s first three exercises began over seven nights. Players already had a difficult time finding space in their full schedules.
Limiting exercises in one day means that training days are more than ever before. The camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in the Westwood training season that has been going on through Mora six times, when the exercises are held at the same time with summer courses.
The exercises are to be held 18 times before the 20th of August, when the actual preparation for the opening of the season begins: UCLA will meet in September at the University of Texas A&M.
Mora says she supported the changes in the NCAA rule, although it made the players' schedules even more stringent.
“We’re really picking them up for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora says.
But the players are ready to work, and they're great friends.
I think the situation will make it easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outside the camp. It is not easy to take into account a direct view of the outdoors in the parking area and the Luski Center, a flat-screen hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs flying over the safety net behind the paint pole.
Bruins players are meant to change to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when rooms are available outside.
\"We have security arrangements,\" Mora says.
“It’s important that people can book a room and describe the exercises for the video. It’s not an exaggerated concern.
The video described in the exercises is paid quite a bit.
But we have guards there and in the parking area.
We're doing our best.
I'm not gonna bother my head with this.
We have a plan...
Release to Rwanda
In the Middle African Rwanda, the presidential elections are held on Friday, the winners of which are already considered clear.
Paul Kagame has been formally seeking his third term, but in practice he has had an impact on the country's leadership since 1994.
Then the rebel group, RPF, stopped the genocide organized by extremists.
He was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticized, among other things, for crushing the opposition and restricting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused of, for example, the distortion of poverty statistics.
For the third season, Kagame will be able to strive for a change in the Constitution that was limited to the two years of the presidency.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a true leader.
In his time, social reforms have been made in Rwanda and international investments have flown.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in combining the country of genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether the liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, the Kagame also promised to his people more freedom after the earth has been lifted up on its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by improving the control of facts
Facebook plans to send possible fake news more and more to independent facts inspectors and to present the results below the original article. The world’s largest social network announced it on Thursday.
On its website, the Company published an opinion that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Possible fake news will be sent to facts inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being the biggest spreader of fake news. Many people believe that fake news was the result of the US presidential election in 2016.
The issue has arisen into a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with false news before the May presidential election and Germany, preparing for the September elections, supports the plan of overcoming social media networks if they do not remove hostile content quickly.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that the facts are being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“People want to see what stories do not pass the independent auditor’s browser. They also want more background information to be able to decide more enlightened what they are reading and sharing – the product manager Sara Su wrote on the company’s blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing the related articles and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The story of a castle
The small Scotney Castle in Kent County is now known as the Squeeze music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout since the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of stormy history behind it. Now this charming place in Bewlin River Valley is the subject of a cartoon book written by Jamie Rhodes, a moppi-haired writer in old documents.
“I’m glad to be able to study the text written by a dead person over 300 years ago,” Rhodes said.
“I feel the personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand.
The book Rhodes, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edvedian era. Each story has been portrayed by different artists, promising British cartoon artist Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not a book based on Rhodes's first archive. In 2014, he appeared from Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, whose inspirational sources were the documents of the British National Library. The project was emotional.
“I moved to tears in a letter with a thumbprint. The letter was written by a double agent working for the Jacobites in the 17th century,” Rhodes said.
It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smelled like smoke, because at that time the fire was used as light.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love the archives.
The author, who spent almost four months in the castle with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the English National Art Council, felt too good to be true. He admits that he could not have been in the castle without delay for a little longer than he would have wanted.
He spent days exploring the Victorian-new – castles, archives, treasures and rares, such as the hyenas hung on the walls and hundreds of bottled bottles.
He traveled with the ruins and facilities of the old castle and discussed with forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes with the artists who picture the book.
In the evening, he started writing whiskey.
The closer history of Scotney is rather unknown, since the city was completely transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of the last heir Elizabeth Hussein in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the foundation staff was only starting the course of the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held for hundreds of years by the same method: by taking everything extra to the attic.
In the archives there were journals, letters from time to time of the English Empire, and maps of who owned anything. “It could be imagined that the country disputes were boring,” Rhodes said.
I thought I'd let you be.
Some of the stories in the book go from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer. It tells about a man who will soon join the English peasant rebellion in 1381 after the completion of the castle.
“The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex reads that there was a riot in the castle in 1380, says Rhodes.
“The English peasant rebellion began in the same area, and it came to mind that the rebellion could start from the riot.
Maybe these events are connected to each other.
The other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, the story of the priest, which Darrell's family hid seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggleller once again tells the story of the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 17th century. He is said to have staged his funeral by filling his coffin with stone (it was noticed years later when his grave was opened).
Darrells are Rhodes’ favorite family in Scotland. “The family’s men seem to have been quite strange guys, and they constantly got into debt and bought things they couldn’t afford.
Darrell's family men solved their debt problem by getting married to wealthy old women.
Rhodes is now looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Lifetime, a paranolia in the early 19th century, where only a fiery plot was left.
Scotney Castle has a special place in her heart.
\"It was sad to leave,\" he said.
I wouldn't have wanted to go back to this evil day.
Between Russia the worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia is clearly deteriorating, said NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
In my opinion, NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we would seek close cooperation with Russia.
But, especially after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and due to continued instability in the Russian East Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to not tightening tensions.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage with Russia in political dialogue in order to avoid a sharping of the situation and a new cold war.
Prior to Stoltenberg’s comments, President Donald Trump found that the US-Russia government had even hit a dangerous bad level.
Trump called on the countries to thank for the poor avoided Congress, which adopted the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko will stop - a return match against Anthony Joshua will not be realized
The long-term heavy-duty series of world champion Vladimir Klitshko finishes his career.
The Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who scored gold at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, won 69 times as a professional, winning 64.
He held different MM titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost his career in two last games.
Tyson Fury hit him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at the Wembley Stadium and disappeared after a violent match in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitshkon were expected to meet at the re-election in Las Vegas in November.
However, Klishko did not find motivation for the match.
I was intentionally using a few weeks to make a decision to get enough distance to the Wembley match, Klitshko told me when he announced.
I arrived as an amateur and professional fighter for everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitshkko's explanations for your decision on video.
The manager of Klitshkon Bernd Bönte reported that the final decision was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating American actor Hayden Panettier since 2009.
He has one child, Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitshko's big brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers managed the World Cup titles at the same time.
Finland's weather provider will rise to the conditions: \"Vie File\"
Minna Nikkinen has suffered from conditions during the summer’s outdoor season.
Minna Nikkas has had problems with circumstances.
Wind and cold have taken a woman from a fiile.
London’s World Championships also have unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkinen is talking about weather.
The conditions have been a summer-long adventure jumper against Minna Nikka.
I don't want to blame the track, but it wasn't clear that I didn't even get the little shears to move properly,\" Nikkinen said after the race innsbruck.
I've competed and practiced here, and I know how many times I've never experienced a different wind in this place, Nikkinen told me about Paavo Nurm's games.
During this period, the standardization of the jump has been very difficult, as there have been such unstable winds in the exercises, Nikkanen said in Kaleva's competitions.
The weather also spoke in London on Thursday.
It's a bit of a challenge to get the technology together -- whether it's cold worship or what.
It's been cold and wind, and it's taken away from the file.
It doesn’t make sense to consume energy in a bad condition.
He got his own gray jump with 455 for the World Championships.
445 is outside.
The relationship is not the same for everyone in London.
You have to be gentle and wait for a better wind.
The goal is to exceed 460 on Friday.
Why don't you just train abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got a jump in the pile and I got the technology standardized.
I think I should have done the same thing now.
Normally, the government has been trained, now the hall has been closed.
What would be an ideal race?
25 degrees warm.
It's a little wind, as long as it's standard.
An ex- official tried to kill politicians on the Upper: “We don’t have any division now or for many years.
Despite the positive climate of the economy, the government of Juha Sipilä must keep the government on track and be careful to tighten the government budget with debt money, warning Erkki Virtanen in the Ministry of Finance for decades.
He said there is no room for division.
In 2015, Yle interviewed retired from Virta in the middle of the week.
The state budget for next year is about to begin.
Recently, the proposals of politicians have been discussed, among other things, on the raising of a guarantee pension, on the calculation of car tax and on the support of electric bicycles, Virtanen sees as an election speech.
They mainly tell us that the elections are starting to be close because when 10% of the government budget is financed with additional debt, we have no allocation now or for many years.
I even think it's a fraud to talk about sharing money when you owe it, Virtanen said to Yle.
Mr Virtanen stressed that all debt is owed to children.
Virtas has a long experience in preparing government budgets: in 1978, he began as a budget secretary at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as a Deputy Head of Budget and Head of Budget.
Last time he retired, he served as the head of the Office of the Ministry of Employment and Economic Affairs.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the current forecast for three percent of economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All predictors estimate that this is a peak from which to go to the under-age next year, and Finland expects a 1% increase in tens of years.
Washington changes the rules of permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that a permanent residence permit, i.e. the Green Card rules, would be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the President supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current programme.
According to the media, applicants benefiting from the new search process who know English and are able to support themselves and who have the skills that benefit our economy.
The Danish queen's spouse does not want to be buried with the queen at the same place
Prince Henrik does not want to be buried with Queen Margareeta.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margareeta were photographed in April.
Queen Margareeta of Denmark, 77, and Prince Henry of his spouse, 83, is not buried next door, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the rulers in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The King's House has announced today that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Roskilde Cathedral, the court says on Thursday.
According to the BT magazine, the reason for this is the dissatisfaction of the prince in his roles in the royal family.
There is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied in his roles and titles in the Danish monarchy, the head of communication of the court, lene Belleby, commented in the journal.
The Prince’s decision not to be buried next to the queen is a natural consequence that he is not treated as equal to his spouse.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of the wish and understanding of the decision on the tomb of her spouse.
Celebrity on the road: The car was on the highway
Tomm had an open partner and two little children.
They were not injured in the accident, but they won’t get the insurance if the other party isn’t aiming.
The crash occurred at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
A archive image of the building site of Body III.
Vantaa Tommi tells his family that his family survived on Tuesday with a miracle in a car accident.
Tommi, his open-minded partner Riina and the couple's two little children drove on the highway with Keimolanport in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
From the connection of Body III to Hämeenlinnavälä, it was time to speed up the white car, which was to drive the family to the side of the car, Tommi says.
Without traffic, the car would have come on with Tom.
I turned and turned the car at the same time, and it went out of hand, Tommi says.
The family car ran into the roof with a lot of speed.
The parents and the rear seat were not injured.
One of the children is a little less than 3 years old, the other is less than a year old.
It must have been a good luck when we had nothing to do with it.
No one in the past even drove us forward, even though there was a lively traffic.
The accident occurred at around 17 a.m.
Tom said no one stopped with them, and the family called the emergency center.
They got their own power out of the car.
The staff of the ambulance and rescue facility arrived, and the condition of the family was checked.
The car went to redemption.
Tommi says he and the open side have small incomes, and they received a family grant for buying a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of another car, the family will not receive money from the insurance.
This is why the family wants witnesses to observe a car that led the family to a blind spot.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take the kids to the garage and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old-fashioned car.
It was probably the late 1990s or the beginning of the 21st century.
He thought the car's registration number was the beginning of SIG.
If we don’t get caught, I don’t know how we’re doing financially, we’re going to have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that something has happened to him or that he knows something is in contact with the police.
The Eastern Uusima Police Department and the Central Uusima rescue facility confirm that they have had a mission on Tuesday evening at the scene of the accident.
The title and the case were repaired at 9:15, unlike the case was originally told, the other car, according to Tomm, did not come to the door of the respondents, but had to drive from the speedtrack to the side of the family car.
Lotta Jappisen's performance deals with human relationships by means of humor - Self-reviewer will be seen at What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, home to the Kouvola, brings his first-time guidance to the What? Theatre.
A self-exhibitor is a music theatre show wrong about past human relationships and inadequateness.
According to Director Lotta Jappis, it still remains a good mind.
The subject is dealt with by the means of humor.
I don't feel like I'm feeling too bad, he says.
According to Jappis, a circular summer theater has been carried out with a long-term budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the proposal challenges you to consider what a person reveals itself to a new person when you get to know him.
Do you think he'll take a role or approach another jacket open?
The uninterrupted presentation confuses the fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatized the show.
He also responds to the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group and does not have a plot.
The director believes that even though the presentation draws young people from their thoughts, it speaks to all ages.
Mr Jäppinen stresses that the self-representer does not tell directly about his or her own or group’s human relations.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my world of value is about the show.
I don’t think human relationships are bad, but I also don’t think that human relationships, especially relationships, would be a good condition.
Many learn from their divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that self-reviewer draws a current picture of young adults living in Finland in a hundred years of age.
Many people have learned a lot from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The show is played by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes the wearer Ella Snellman.
Music reconciliation is Jappisen and Rokan.
The love of the theatre was set up in Kouvola
Lotta Jappinen, 26 from Kouvola, is studying as director of the theatre expression at Turku University of Applied Sciences.
It's two years behind, and there's another mess in front of it.
The excitement of the theatre has started over the years in Kouvola.
The music classes have been an assistant to the Kovola Theatre and played at the University Theatre in Helsinki, and lastly at the Linna Theatre in Turku.
Control has started to interest more and more.
The self-repairer got his first night in Helsinki last week at Narr's showroom.
In the future, about 45 minutes of the show was also seen at least in the University of Jappinen in Turku.
Kouvola What? Theatre at 8 p.m. at 19 p.m. and 5 p.m. at 14 and 19 p.m.
The Finnish Olympic winner recovered from a terrible motocross accident for a year - the neckline broke.
Few athletes in Finland have the same unlocked natural power as Janne Lahtla.
At the time of the coup, hundreds of days a year went around the world for twenty years and pursued their dream of the Olympic gold.
The dream was completed in 2002, but the Lahtla movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainee, but also an experimenter of new species.
There are not many forms of physical activity on earth that the Kemijärvi would not have tried at least once.
It has inspired me to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtla says.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahtla altogether.
In 2014, Lahtla was in a motorcross accident.
As a result, his neck and both his hands broke.
I wasn't working anywhere.
I've been licking wounds at my home for a year, Lahtla says.
Lahtla had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have had some part of it.
Driving on a ferry can sound crazy.
But I didn't apply for borders.
It's just so hard as a species that you don't have to do too much!
After the accident, Lahtla was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
He was the head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtla started his work immediately after the end of his career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do anything, Lahtla says.
During the training period, Lahtla frequently challenged her protective positions in front and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that my thoughts didn’t seem reasonable either.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be in position.
I really enjoyed it because I could only be once.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtla to become Finland’s head coach.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'd be burned.
It’s easier to find places that have gone apart than straight!
Without the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtla started as a coach of the Finnish freestyle country team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby for the pacers.
I changed the motocross to Frisbeegolf!
It just got out of the shovel right now.
At his worst, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Although Lahtla has always been a super-intelligent coach, she does not require her coach to be the same as her.
I don't force everyone into the same fashion.
In our culture, there is room to be like one another and the ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtola says.
Sexbots are coming and we have to be concerned.
It’s here: a report on the development of technology in the sex robot industry – just as it had started to feel that 2017 could no longer become weirder.
Yeah, yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Responsible Robotic Foundation (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5-10 years.
“We need to take a serious approach to the generalization of sex robots,” says Noel Sharkey Sheffield, founder of the Foundation and professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the type of color, shape of the nipples and the type of fingers of the robot’s eyes.
“For sex robots, they are already sold quite a lot, and we will see them more and more,” Sharkey said.
Sexy dolls have evolved from blowing dolls to robots with warm-looking silicone skin and artificial intelligence created traits that resemble human use.
The user may also adapt his or her own preferences to the color of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and to the type and color of the fingers.
Even more worrying is that robots have a \"personality\" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sexy girls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, even for shy.
The Roxxy Gold robots of True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
“Roxxy Gold’s personality adapts to the user’s personality as fully as possible, the company’s website is advertised.
In other words, robots like the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It may be tired, in a conversation mood or in a wind.
There are many worrying features in the generalization of sex robots. They replace real human relationships, but even more dangerous is women's subordination and direct rape fantasy when the user approaches, for example, a shy and counter-provoking programmed robot.
True Companion compares the Roxxy robot to the vibrator:
“Women have a vibrator, so why shouldn’t men have sex robots?
However, sexbots are not just a fetish or a new sex toy.
Their generalization and development is about some of our darker and deeper culture: the decline of gender equality towards sexual relations, where subordination is one alternative among others.
The majority of men, of course, do not get sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
But the marginal phenomena tell us a lot about the spirit of time.
And many start to behave strangely or offensively only when the market permits it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have begun to become more common at the same time as women’s rights are threatened around the world and the White House is seated by the president who has been boasting women.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale (Orjatársi) is not the most worrying of its powerful image language, for example, pictures of hanged bodies and the eyes dug out. The most disturbing is how the realistic series of the world feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Sex robots are being tried to make as much like real women (in terms of pornstars) as technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and movements to imitate human movements as well as possible.
But their “personality” is far from reality.
The robot can't leave the relationship or the situation.
They do not have their own will or history – nothing that refers to independence or complete surrender violates fantasy.
They are pleasant servants.
Slavery.
Police suspect: Two acts of terrorism were planned in Australia, leading the group to ISIS Chief
The head of the intelligence organization Isis led a group of Australian men suspected of taking the bomb into the plane of Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person in the lead character of the Isis had also sent the building blocks of the bomb to Sydney.
According to the reservations, the bomb was to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police won't tell us more about why the company stopped.
The second plan of suspected terrorists was to build a device to extract toxic colourless gas and take the device into a spot in a public place, such as a public transport device.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews will continue.
The good parts of Trump?
Get Mitt Romney to show a sanity of mind.
Trump’s period has already been repeated to get bored, that the strong division of voters at everyday level has also broken families.
On Christmas and Thanksgiving, the American newspaper’s advisory boards guided how to deal with Trump’s voters.
We all want to clear our information patterns.
Trump’s ability to unite families has been less attentive.
I'm going to tell you this because my cousin was visiting me this week in New York, a poet of the left-wing spirit in Chicago, who has long been the closest to our family Republicans.
He reminded me that a common enemy could have a strong uniting effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousins are all familiar – also a Republican-sponsored sister with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades – are suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but more widely thought about it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new flow, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually lead us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and normalization, we talk about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to scare his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more horrifying possibility that Trump normalizes the right extreme Republicans, which suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
I recall Mitt Romney’s controlled version of madness: a dog on the roof of the car, a 14% income tax (and his tax returns we have seen at least). Compared to Trump, they seem like very mild violations.
When Trump's season is over, the next Republican presidential candidate needs to be clear and immediately feel like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our child to the Carousel of the Central Park, which is the biggest carousel in the park department in New York, and the best thing in New York to get three dollars without caffeine.
The horses of the carusell are huge, in the middle of the characters – the gloomy clowns and the beasts looking behind them – are malicious, and the music behind the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of the characteristics of New York are disappointed over time: the views of the tall buildings begin to get bored, the city's silhouette becomes too familiar, and the reality of the city is not responsible for dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I haven’t gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a big transport circle in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, however, is a Swiss-speaking pub, but is not counted.
Instead, the carousel of the Central Park is still a strange magical experience – even to the extent that two two two-year-olds, one-one-year-old and two-four-year-old women enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the carousel full points if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately no one came to ask questions.
Instead, this week, I was asked at the department store to evaluate - my payment experience - on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card on a reading device.
The same thing at the cafe with my corner of the house, but there's also an option for me to combine an estimate of 15% of the service money when I go to the coffee bar myself.
This slows down the everyday interaction and pressures the customer server to put their person in a game where it is not needed.
The seller smiled at the time when I gave five stars to my credit card experience.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Interi - there was no leadership trust.
FC Inter has released the mission of the Shefki Kuq Society Mission Team.
The training responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Picchareta, who previously served as a assistant coach.
The rest of the training team will continue in its current tasks.
Picchareta, Italy, has previously served as an assistant coach in Sunderland, England.
In January, Piccareta, a 51-year-old group of Inter trainings, has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan Håkans, chairman of the board of FC Inter, sorry about what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
Shefki Kuq, however, no longer had the trust of the company's management, so there was no other option now, Håkans commented on the company's statement.
The Picquereta Agreement is valid until the end of the period.
He is already in charge of the HIFK tomorrow with the rest of the coaching team.
According to the data from the evening-says, the team has been hanging through Thursday.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the club’s assistant coach Piccareta and John Allen had been turned aside.
Kuqi and Piccarreta strongly joined in Inter's match against PS Kem last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth picture from the 80s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
The violinist Linda Lampenius published a young picture on Instagram.
The image has been added to several espionages, which suggests that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student.
Lampenius himself wonders a young woman looking at the camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he's communicating.
If the picture doesn't show, you can look at it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and has also spoken about painful topics.
A fair year ago, he published a picture pair of himself on Instagram.
In the second picture, he is seen 20 years ago, in the second he poses now, as a mother of two children.
In his illustration, Lampenius meditates on his own growth as a human being and refers to eating disorders that he suffered younger.
20 years ago and today...
I still look like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learned to like myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added to English hashtags life, eating disorder, uncertain, self-confidence, self-esteem, loves himself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, ageing is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating shortages in previous years.
At the age of 14, he was in the hospital for anorexia and ortorex.
A little later, he also became ill with his bulimia, which eventually appeared only in 2006.
The healing began to slow down.
In addition to therapy and comparison, Lampenius helped with new love.
Oscar Pistorius was sent from prison to hospital for chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized with wounds on his wrists, which, according to the prison authorities, he fell in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of the murder of the defendants of the original murder sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door through his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder who hid in the toilet.
The prosecutors have reported their intention to complain again because they regard the six-year sentence of Pistorius as too mild.
The UK prosecutor intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the complaint may be dealt with this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the judgment of Pistorius may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally encamped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, according to the country’s foreign ministry’s BTV channel.
The police arrested a group of people who were encamped in Sithonia in the morning of August 1 and there were two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released on the same day, but the case will continue.
According to the TV channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that they had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free campsites and already fines for anyone who is encamped in areas other than the intended area.
The checks will continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced that the right to fine may be imposed.
Neste’s share is sinking - wet already -7.7%
Neste’s share of oil grows by 7.7 per cent at 11 a.m.
Its result before taxes fell, but exceeded the forecast of Inquiry Financial.
The stock market has started to visit today slightly on the side of the package, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
After the launch of the stock exchanges, the large European Stoxx 600 index had fallen by 0.2%.
The general index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange OMXH had fallen by 0.3 per cent after about half an hour of trading to 959.48 points and the most varied companies OMXH25 had fallen by 0.3 per cent.
The total exchange was 41 million euros, of which nine million were the results of the morning published by Nestette.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may alleviate an irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like the nightmares of the digestive system.
However, a recent study suggests the opposite: a diet with high levels of meat protein and milk products may facilitate an irritable bowel syndrome.
Anxiety intestinal syndrome is an incurable disease with about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in the UK. It causes abdominal cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers from the Washington University found that the necessary amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen intestinal tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, the immune cells guard the mouth and ensure that the harmful microbes in the food do not hide in the body.
The cells that cause infections are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, the result may be an irritable bowel syndrome.
Studies have shown that the immune cells that strengthen tolerance are present in mice with a specific bacteria in the intestine.
This bacteria needs tryptophan to make immune cells appear. Tryptophane is one of the protein building materials.
“We found a connection between the development of the Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and the development of cells that promote tolerance. The Lactobacillus reuter is part of the normal microbial intestinal tract,” Professor Colonna says.
The more the diet of mice had tryptophan, the more they had such immune cells.
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactoblastus reuter and a high-tryptophane diet can strengthen the intestinal resistance and reduce inflammation sensitivity.
In researching the immune cells that strengthen tolerance, researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barraga discovered that although one mouse group had such cells, they did not have the same type of mouse that was kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was linked to the intestinal microbioma of mice, i.e. the normal gastrointestinal tract of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
When DNA was studied in mice, six species of bacteria were observed in mice with immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactoblastus reuteri was administered to mice in a sterile environment with no intestinal microbiologists and no immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
Researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They raised Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in the liquid and transferred small amounts of fluids – without bacteria – to mice isolated from the unripe immune cells.
Immune cells evolved into resistant cells.
When the active ingredient was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indole-3 milk acid.
When the researchers doubled the number of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of cells that confirm tolerance increased by about 50%. When the number of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased from half of the previous year.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, people have the same tolerance-strength cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products of Lactobacillus reuper-bacterial cells can develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects associated with cryptophan have been observed in patients with inflammatory intestinal syndrome.
“We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation in the intestines, says Cervantes-Barragan.
The high troptophan levels combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their generalization.
Jose Mourinho said Manchester United received a contract with Neron after Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United received a contract with Nemanja Matic in line with his line-up match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
A total of 40 million pounds from Chelsea, Matic began a two-to-two win in Dublin, the final match before the UEFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He made an impression as a defender against stars such as Paul Pogban and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not in the best condition yet, because he was not involved in the tour of the blue beads of Asia before the beginning of the season. He only took 45 minutes on the field – according to Mourinho, a change must be made before the beginning of the election season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, and his thinking make him a genius – he has a natural football thinking ability,” Mourinho says.
“We’ll help him to be ready sooner than later.
In addition to Matic, the newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romeo Lukaku were starting the game at Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho began to cut its start-up meeting for the beginning of the season.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants another three new players, although the club has already done a great job – by acquiring three of his four players.
“Three out of four – it has to be thanked to the company – he added.
“I’m happier if I get all four, but they’ve done a great job.
Balloon women bullied Germany for two batches
The Finnish women’s volleyball team lost its fourth match in the World Cup to Germany directly from 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany’s routine level of play is high.
Their game was in every sector, Finnish head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in the statement.
In the first two parts, Finland held its opponents narrow, but in the third part Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and in certain places with enough aggressiveness, we were able to work with them, Kangasniemi said.
Finland’s most effective 14 points were Piia Korhonen.
Three more games of four lost in Finland will be held in Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: A great jury has already sent challenges to Trump Jr's meeting in Russia
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges to Donald Trump Jr and Russian lawyer Natalia Vesselnitskaya.
The great jury called together by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent challenges to the meeting of Russian attorneys named Donald Trump Jr and Kreml.
It is reported by Reuters, a news agency who, at the same time, confirms Wall Street Journal's earlier notice of the invitation of a large jury on Thursday.
According to Reuters, a large jury has sent challenges to the meeting of the Veselnitskaya, known for the Trump Jr and the Kremlin, held in the middle of the U.S. presidential elections in June 2016.
There were also Donald Trump Sr’s campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, the current White House advisor, Jared Kushner.
According to the Reuters sources, the fact that the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has invited a large jury in Washington is an increase in the rate of study in Russia.
The departures add that Mueller wanted a large jury to help investigate Russia's involvement in the US presidential elections and whether Trump's campaign or his close-up cooperation with Russia was carried out.
The grand jury expands Mueller's rights to collect evidence, send challenges and force people to testify with oath.
The great jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury weighs the evidence found in the prosecutor’s investigation and decides whether the case should be brought up.
British inventor microchiped himself to get home and in his car with a hand swing
The British inventor has been the first to micrositize himself throughout the country so that he can open his home to the outer door, get into his office and start his car with a hand swing.
Microsiru is between the thumb of the 33-year-old Steven Northam and the front finger. Now he offers a service to businesses and individuals who want to facilitate their lives by using Northam BioTeq technology.
Northam collaborates with Geoff Watson, a specialist in the Royal Hampshire hospital in Winchester, Hans, in order to meet the medical requirements of microchip installation.
The microchip uses the same technology as the microchips of cats and dogs, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company will also turn the locks of houses and cars into compatible with the microchip. The handling of one lock costs £300.
Northam is married, and he has one child. He has placed microchip technology in his home and BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
Your White House show cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The final decision of the White House to fly a helicopter of the Navy to the southern lawn area of the White House was to pay the taxpayers $24,000 for the American production.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the President is on his way to the White House on 17 July 2007.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials met with products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter produced in Connecticut, the samples included a sailboat from Maine, a fire car from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississip.
The White House military office had requested the helicopter to be placed on a mission by order only about 36 hours before its landing in the southern lawn area – an exceptional event. This is evident from the documents of the HMX-1 helicopter support of the Navy.
“I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of the matter, because this is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility, the commander of the HMX-1 unit wrote on the day before the event in an email to his supervisor, who is the assistant commander of the Navy flight.
It was reported that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn at 17.7.7 in the morning and the event would begin from three afternoons. The helicopter would leave the place only after the lawn field was emptyed between six and nine in the evening.
In addition, the message stated that if the helicopter's departure from the White House was delayed, another crew would be required due to limitations on service hours.
The original crew was in the helicopter for the time of the incident, and the unit's security staff was with the helicopter when it was in the ground.
The documents received by TIME are not clear whether another crew was eventually needed.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked about the violation of the law.
“One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act. We were told not to break,\" the commander wrote.
“It sounds like you can participate, the Deputy Commander replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
The official events also have political tones.
At the time, the president spoke in favour of the reform of health and looser state regulation in the Senate.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents have to use them on their journeys,
But their use for photos is unusual.
Trump's actions took place in February, when Air Force One launched the President's campaign in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor's presidential plane on Twitter.
“The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, where products made from American workers’ American materials from all 50 states were presented,\" said White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews regularly make training flights in the Washington area and train the president to the White House with centimeter accuracy on the southern lawn field.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 exercises for the White House.
According to an official, flights to Made in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
The helicopters of the unit were also on that day for 11 hours to non-presidencies.
According to the White House, the event did not entail any other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky reported that the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter demonstration in the southern lawn area of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have an accounting for flights related to the duties of the President, and the exact assessment of the costs of the event is difficult.
According to the Ministry of Defence’s 2017 hourly compensation, the VH-3D helicopter’s compensation level is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 unit documents, flights from Quantico to the White House from Virginia to the White House and back lasted an hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are clearly lower.
“The calculation of the costs to farmers according to the level of compensation is misleading,” Walters said.
The proposed level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs, which are taken into account in the annual appropriations.
According to a report by the RAND research company in 2015, the compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter in the event.
“The idea is to present American production,” Spicer said.
“I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and employing hundreds or thousands of people through it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of helicopters and other defence supplies that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is absolutely appropriate to present it.
It's not certain if Trump was in a helicopter during the event, but at least he sat in the fire truck driver's seat.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky stage.
\"I know Sikorsky very well,\" the president said. \"I have three of them.
The lightning hit the Vaasa track - the trains must be replaced by buses
The passenger train traffic between the Wall River and Vaasa is broken due to a technical fault, according to the Rail Traffic Centre.

The failure of the traffic control system caused the thunder.
In the morning there was no estimate of the duration of the repair at the railway station.
Venezuelan state prosecutor calls for the right to prevent the appointment of a new country representative
The State Prosecutor of Venezuela has applied for a court decision that would prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
The President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that last Sunday’s vote is to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, the country was elected a representative body, which may, among other things, change the constitution of the country.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the rejection decision has been requested due to elections.
Ortega has also started an election examination.
He appointed two judges after the British company, which organised the vote, said that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro’s allies were nominated for the representative, and among other things, Maduro’s son and wife were elected representatives.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, the representative body may break down the Congress led by the opposition and change the laws.
Maduro as a dictator
Maduro's actions are widely condemned.
The opposition considers the Constitution to be a tool for Maduro to strengthen its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called it a dictator.
In turn, the European Union, the UK, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have declared that they do not recognise new representatives.
Maduro claims that a new representative is a solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, unrest has been going on for months.
There are a number of people wounded, and over a hundred are dead.
Venezuela fell into economic crisis after the price of oil fell.
Now many people can’t afford food or medication.
The opposition is also expected to show the opinion on Friday, when the new representative is to begin.
Russian man delivered by Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
The Minneapolis court in the United States condemned the 41-year-old Maxim Senah for nearly four years incarcerated from participation in global computer intelligence.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of the US demand.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
He was arrested by Finnish border authorities when he was coming home.
In February 2016, Finland provided the US judicial authorities with Senah, despite Russian objections, says AFP.
He was found guilty of computer fraud in March of this year, which had received millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be expelled from the country after the execution of the prison sentence.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused Finland strictly after the arrest and said that a man should not be surrendered to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were accused that the arrest was carried out in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury that infected dozens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish user names and passwords.
Since then, the Hujars used data by further directing internet traffic, which provided for click scams and disseminated spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, director of the Justice Department, the case shows that the United States is capable of hunting other cybercrime.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco told us.
Modified at 8:58: Literating the name of the sentenced person.

Two men fighting at the shopping center in Espoo
Two men were born into a dispute at the Iso Omena Park Hall in Espoo on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute was started when the other party was accidentally driving in a prohibited direction.
There was a verbal dispute between the drivers.
The driver, driving in a forbidden direction, would strike the driver of another car, which led to the car running into the car of the hitter.
After that, he hit a car in the plane.
In the initial conversation, the man has admitted that he has caused damage and committed a false act.
Timo Soin’s article, titled by the question mark: “After that, there was waterfall.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (v.) published a blog on Thursday, titled by a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences in size.
During my time, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven members of the Government Party.
After that, there was a waterfall, now everything floats, Soini writes.
The text of Soin contains references to France in the 17th century.
King Ludvig XV or his lover Madame de Pompadour is known to have used the waterfall comparison.
Depending on the interpretation of history, the books of history have left the flooding of water after us, or after me, the flooding of water.
According to the UN, Afghanistan's democracy depends on the political role of women.
Elections are only representative if they can vote for all members of society, including women, said the UN Head of Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.

The elections of the Afghanistan County Council and President will be held on 5 April 2017.
Taliban has made threats to elections at the same time as international forces are moving to a consultative role.
This year's elections are the first time that power moves peacefully from a democraticly elected government to another.

The flooding threat of certain tourists to the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The local rage is particularly focused on the form of tourism for cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it the \"eat and flee\" tourism: it is only a few hours away, and it is rushed through the great crowds of attractions.
Venice is a fast day trip to the city for tourists.
In the narrow streets, it is difficult to move and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice will no longer be able to fit in.
They have been forced to move further away from the historic centre, while hotels have become available for home use.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about tourism problems in Venice.
The authorities are considering restrictions on tourist rates.
They call the current phenomenon a low-quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, time is given for two or three hours.
You follow the flag-keeping guide to Piazzale Romala Rialton Bridge and St Markus Square, and turn back, the Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini describes the prevailing and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We need to keep this part of the city's identity.
The St Markus Market is also one of the most popular places to visit in the historical centre of Venice.
The Church of St Mark is located on the side of the tower.
Local anger is also mainly focused on cruise ships.
There are more than 50,000 locals in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, nearly 2,000 Russians expressed their views on mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives the inhabitants away.
About 2,000 inhabitants leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be no tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster,” says Carlo Belframe, who has been in the organization.
The equation is difficult, because ships bring to Venice the incomes it desperately needs and create the need for many different jobs.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution is to ensure that cross-borders go further from the historic centre.
According to the Venice-based Luciano Borlot, the situation would certainly change if the Venetian administrative area, where Venice is located, would have more power to decide its own affairs - unless full autonomy.
There are around 20-30 million tourists every year in Venice.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
On the highway, the bad congestions of the kilometres
On the north highway between Kuopio and Lake Siilijärvi, there has been a mile of congestion on Thursday afternoon’s work during the return journey.
In the area, motor road coating work is carried out, which slows down traffic, says Savo Sanomat.
For roadwork, the speed limit of 50 km is instead of normal 120 km per hour.
Even in the 50-mile limit area, however, traffic had progressed in practice on Thursday afternoon.
On Thursday afternoon, the roadwork went on the side of the lake Siilijärvi to the statue of Revelation, or the golden kauri.
I'll be fine without that attention.
A 23-year-old runner has been forced to see the churches of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published wonderful images of himself in the landscapes of Grand Canyon, among other things.
The Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in Norway, not least because he broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in a 400-metre running tour at 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400-metre fence at the Norwegian record 55.38.
Soon after his record, Iuel, who uses social media, found out that fame and publicity have their shadows.
Men from all over the world began sending pictures of their sexual organs to Iuel in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel had to close his Snapchat account from outside.
I got a lot of, uh, a bunch of, uh, a lot of, uh, a bunch of, uh, a bunch of pictures from unknown people, so I had to turn my account into a private one, Iuel told the VG magazine.
Iuel did not want the VG interview to identify exactly what kind of pictures he received.
You can guess, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after a run, but I'll be fine without any other kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is a Danish, and his father is a Danish-Norwegian.
The Iuel family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, her family moved to Namibia, then to Pakistan, because of her father’s work.
After that, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were on the move.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he exchanged Danish citizenship for Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is trained by three coachs, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to debate than the United States.
Coaches in the United States don’t ask for anything but give only regulations.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to be personally involved with the athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records at 400 metres and 400 metres in the fence.
A snowboarder took Janne Korve to the scale of the entire career - now involved in the World Championships: “It’s nice to not hurt anything.
It's been nice to count now that nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, 31 of Finland’s most successful snowboarders, has again come to enjoy its beloved species.
Last summer, the career was at stake.
The heavy damage to the table had forced the Korve to the table in January, and the foot had no desire to heal.
His hand had also been hit in the race.
In the summer, I didn’t know what I was doing, whether it was going to go on board or not.
Sponsoridils were broken and many things were open, Korpi says.
But it is said that things tend to be organized.
The foot improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to pull back to the chest.
After that, it was easy.
I knew it no later than when I first went to the snow.
I was so damn sure this was so funny again, we're gonna pull it out a couple more.
The body was able to count properly only in September-October, but after a long break, it has been a big deal of pain-free training.
There are only a few races around Korpi.
It's okay.
The competitions have never been the most important aspect of Korvelle’s plateplay.
I've never fallen for a race.
I find it frustrating to target you for four years for one race, and then you're hot for the week.
I can't think like that, Korpi says.
Today, the Korpi race is held in the low-end World Championships held in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though individual races don’t like him on board, he’s always on fire with a hard fight.
According to Korvu, the appreciation of the international ski routes has increased over the past few years, although some of the boarders chose the Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, the visibility is great.
However, in my opinion, appreciation always depends on the conditions and the level of the competitions.
The Corps is the oldest athlete of the Finnish 12-person team in Sierra Nevada.
The team’s peaks, Rene Rinnekangas, and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger.
It's nice to follow up with younger friends.
I remember when I was at the time that everything was new and was so excited about everything.
It brings a new flow to itself, the Corps thinks.
I'm still on the front, but otherwise I don't, that's how much the guys have the power!
Janne Korpi has also built a different sports career.
The son of the director legend Pekka Korve has been involved in therapeutic sports: the boarder has his own therapeutic horses for whom he is performing training programs.
When I'm on the road all the time, it won't be more time for me to be in the mess.
But every day, I look at at at least the results of nutrition, and usually something about the departures, Korpi says.
Treatment management and treatment preparation are a potential career plan, according to Korve, when the boarding career comes to an end.
I'm not planning so far, but it's at least a likely option.
I'm going to experience it a little bit as if I were studying it in addition to snowboarding.
I'm trying to keep up with the nerves of time and to develop, maybe in the summer I'm going to drive some departures.
If it’s my future profession, then it’s not hard to start when you’re already in the species.
This includes the Elitlopet treatment tour organised with Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship that is heading to the Elitloppet restaurant in Stockholm at the end of May.
The Corps and Linnonmaa decided to reinvigorate the old tradition.
The cruise has been very commercial, and people have been excited.
We are already at the point where there is no bankruptcy.
A few months are still a while, we hope to get the ship filled,\" Korpi says.
Attendo’s nursing home project for Kitee has surprised everyone.
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new 41-seater nursing home built on Kite.
The building of a large 1,700 layer square meters will be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre’s neighbor’s Health Road.
The theme of general wonder is where the new care unit is enough for customers, for now during Siu’s wars, many private nursing homes can get a customer shortage.
Anne Flink Attendo, Regional Manager of Care Services, commented that in the future, Kite will have more demand not only for options but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Attendo bought private nursing homes from Katee last year in Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The transaction concerned business, but the real estate is a five-year lease agreement.
Flink says that Attendo does not have an acute need to move operations away from these facilities.
More about this later today.
GMB is concerned about the continuation of the McVitie’s brand’s Scottish factory
The trade union is seeking from McVitie’s manufacturers to strengthen their long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the Department of Scotland of GMB, the UK’s general trade union has not told us about its plans for the future of the Tollcross factory.
Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products manufactured by the factory have more than 500 employees.
The Pladis company, owned by McVitie's brand, said he invested over £5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that the employees and the trade union representatives will certainly be told the first if there are changes in the activity.
In its letter to the CEO, GMB calls on the company to respond to the concern that no financing has been provided for the modernisation of production lines.
The GMB trade union Drew Duffy is very concerned about the fact that the CEO does not have clear information about the business needs of Tollcross and the investment plans for the future.
“Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has focused heavily on the local community and the metropolitan area of Glasgow. The plant is a major employer in the area of high unemployment and low living.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and income, and Brexit, rising living costs and continuous reduction in production, the Eastern Glasgow needs successful McVitie's production in a painful way.
According to the Pladis informant, the factory manager had received the letter of the trade union only on the previous day and the company is directly responsible for the letter, as it appreciates the continuous interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
“We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed several issues.
We discussed with employees, among other things, the fact that, like other very competitive and uncertain companies in the market, we constantly assess all our transactions and offices in order to maintain our competitiveness.
According to the media, the company has invested more than 5 million pounds in Tollcross factory in recent years, in particular its production lines and its activities.
“We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a production facility, and we will be sure to tell the first employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the operation of the plant.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret her interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on Neymar’s goal after paying £189 million for the termination of the contract. But did PSG warn Barcelona about a record transfer three years ago?
A sensational move is the most spoken case in the summer. The French League 1 football team is ready to break the world record of the transitions. The previous record was less than half smaller: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer amount of £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar becomes the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's best paid professional athlete, as PSG offers him more than £500 per week after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be a waste of PSG’s operations and the way Neymar has left the crowd. A source close to Barcelona tells us that the club has been very concerned about Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of the PSG warn the football world of this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that he was interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned the best players of PSG.
“I’m not worried, because they know that if they want our players, we’ll become their opponents, and we’ll contact their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all the euro.
But if they want our players, they have to face the consequences.
Barcelona seems to have committed precisely this: it expressed its interest in the PSG midfield player Marco was compared earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italians to leave under any circumstances. It could well be that Barcelona will lose its star player, Neymarin.

Now, Trump's phone calls were invented - White House spokesman: \"I wouldn't say it was a lie.
The White House admits that two of the US President Donald Trump's calls never happened, reports the New York Times.
The phone calls that Trump smoked with both the president of Mexico and the leader of the patrol organization have proved to be inventive.
The White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
But he said Trump didn't lie.
According to Sanders, many of the leaders of the patrols spoke to Trump personally, and Trump and the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto had discussed at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
