Two powerful women share the secrets of their success
What do Barbara Corcoran and Laila Ali have in common?
At first glance, these women come from two completely different worlds.
New York Real Estate Magnate Barbara Corcoran was able to convert a thousand-dollar loan into a $5 billion real estate company before applying her expertise on a telescreen, participating in the "Shark Tank" investor panel of ABC's reality series.
Laila Ali has been following her father, becoming the most successful female fighter as a four-time unbeatable champion, before the roles of the TV director, the author and the speaker were added to his resume.
Despite their unique career paths (or perhaps because of them), TJ Maxx recruited both women to help them talk to the whole room about the break-in of stereotypes and the achievement of high-flying goals.
Last year, T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women in shops across the country and discovered that 80 per cent of them feel that society has set them a stereotypically solid roles and expectations.
As a result, they came out with The Maxx You Project to help women break these barriers.
Corcoron and Ali know a lot about it, but they may be at the top of their field by now, but the journey was not smooth for either of them.
Corcoran was awarded Ds in high school and college and had already worked at 20 jobs at the age of 23.
Ali entered one of the most central areas of men, and in addition, he faced the challenge of trying to step out of the shadow of his father, who was an icon of the world.
To put it mildly, the two are packing through the knowledge they have acquired.
That is why we sat down with these influential women to talk about overcoming failures, coping with success, and trusting our gut feelings in business and relationships.
What inspires you to do what you do every day?
Laila Ali: I am inspired by my personal goals every day.
I have designed a habit of writing down the things I want to achieve.
And I'll look at that list.
I think I'm responsible.
Of course, I'm inspired by my children.
My ambitions inspire me.
I wish to be victorious in everything I do in my life.
I understand that it takes hard work to achieve my goals, but I am prepared to do so.
My confidence stems from preparation.
So I spend a lot of time preparing.
Barbara Corcoran: Like Laila, my confidence is the key to too much preparation, but I will not draw my inspiration from it.
Actually, I am inspired by the genuine curiosity.
What happens if I do this?
What's not gonna happen if I don't?
That curiosity makes me get out of bed in the morning, because I can't wait to see what the day brings.
If I don't feel that way some day, I'm just pretending to feel that way.
Then I'm going to believe in myself, and I'm going to get inspired again.
Talk about a few obstacles in your career that made you better in the long term.
Barbara Corcoran: For me, the hardest part was when my business partner, the one who loved me, left me and married my secretary.
I finished business a year later, but this year of my life - being the fifth wheel - was terrible because I didn't have the confidence to leave.
I felt subdued. There was no inspiration.
But amazing things happen.
It's hard to believe in this when you're hit by setbacks.
It was extremely difficult to get out of my way and start business again - this time without a partner - this year was extremely difficult.
Laila Ali: I would say that my career was the hardest time when I was fighting, I was at the top of my career, and I decided to give up my divorce.
I didn't just divorce my husband, but also the manager and the person who taught me everything I know about boxing.
I didn't think I could handle it without him.
So I began to worry about my career for the future and had to find the time to step back and say to myself, "You have all the knowledge and experience you need.
You have all these experiences in the boxing circle.
You can definitely do it."
So I formed a new team around me and continued my career.
In fact, it was just necessary to get the right attitude, because everything else got pushed from there.
I did what had to be done, I had to face fear and find the courage to get rid of my husband and the manager and continue my career, and everything worked out.
When did you feel that you really made progress?
Laila Ali: I felt that I had made progress when I won my first championship title.
It was a really good feeling, because when I started boxing, I wanted to be one of the best, undefeated.
I was able to achieve this goal, and I didn't win the title of the championship one time, four times.
Barbara Corcoran: The moment I felt I had made progress was in my eleventh year of action.
I had finally made a profit.
I had earned a profit of about $42,000 I couldn't expect.
I went out immediately and bought a new car for my mom and dad, and they never had a new car, so I had them deliver the cars to Florida, where they held their retirement.
I felt like Queen of England.
I felt so cool.
In the years that followed, I made much more money, but nothing has so far been able to provide an equivalent feeling as an opportunity to give back something to my parents and to surprise them.
How could you keep yourself motivated during this 11-year period to continue working?
Barbara Corcoran: I never measured my business by profit, because it was not my goal.
I just wanted to see how far I could get.
I had a dream of becoming the real estate queen of New York on the first day.
And I saw myself as a pope in my mind, all kissing my ring and worshiping me.
There was such a little thought in my head.
So when I kept trying every day, every hour, I didn't really mean making money.
Finally, I made money by mistake.
But all the money that came in, I went right back into business.
I don't even think I've had a lot of alarming days where I would have thought, oh, God, we don't make any money.
I was just convinced that something was going to work.
The worst thing that could have happened would have been losing the company and becoming a waitress again.
So I made a good tip, and I was happy.
I could be happy again.
Therefore, I do not believe that the great effort of many people who have made progress is money.
They have other motives that encourage them.
And the money wasn't one of mine.
Do you have any advice for anyone who has such great dreams but is held back by a financial factor?
Barbara Corcoran: When I started making a lot of money, I had money to invest in real estate, but I didn't have time.
I started a business.
And that's why I found five different partners, not even specialists in the brokerage, but in different neighborhoods all over the city, who knew their streets and broke down.
I approached them and said, "You know this neighborhood.
Find me the best building.
I'll give you the money, and you'll be my partner."
The lesson here is that if you have money, you need people to make money with your money.
And if you have a gift, you can sell it to someone who has money and make money with it.
There are two aspects: talent and money.
But if we're not both together, nothing big will happen.
In the end, I - and also my partners - have done very well all these years together with the excellent investors I would never have had if I had the courage to find combatful people who like to take a step.
It's always possible to raise money if you believe you have the talent and know your part of the world better than anyone else.
What are the two or three things you do every morning that help you succeed?
Laila Ali: I don’t know about you, but I have a lot of moments in my life when I feel overwhelmed by being a mother, a businesswoman, a husband... all the roles we play as women.
I've reached a point in my life where I really had to set up the morning routine.
I like to get up and just feel grateful.
Thank you for your resurrection, your health, your children, your family.
I often write down what my goals are for the next day, and when I wake up, I'll look at this list again.
Meditating.
Sometimes I write in the diary.
I always drink a cup of coffee.
And I always do my first thing in the morning, 'cause if I don't, I don't do it.
For me, it is ultimately a matter of priorities.
These are things that are important to me: my spirituality, my focus on the universe and God, then my training, and my priority in health.
Thanks to this, everything else seems simple.
I feel I can take all the challenges I face within the day.
Barbara Corcoran: I'm putting things in order.
I'm going through a list of tasks that are endless and ridiculous.
And I'll set up what's most important.
What are the real priorities?
I'm trying to accept these most important things.
What are you doing to take yourself to a big meeting in the right mood?
Barbara Corcoran: I imagine myself failing.
Strange as it isn't.
I mean, Lord, I'm failing.
I'm scared, and it makes me feel more intense.
I imagine anyone who competes with me - by nature I am very keen to fight because I am one of the ten children and we never got enough attention from our parents.
I can be very competitive.
And I'll always be there too thoroughly prepared.
Too much preparation strengthens my confidence.
Laila Ali: Amazing how opposed we are in this regard.
We are two successful people, and it shows how different things work for different people.
I like to imagine I'm successful.
I like to think about what's going to be a success.
I imagine it in my mind, I see it actually happening.
I see a boxing ring, a fight, myself winning the belt and returning to the dressing room, celebrating victory with a piece of cake, as I've always done.
The same applies to meetings.
I always prepare myself thoroughly, however, because this confidence is the result of preparation, because there is a fear in my neck that I will not do well or I will not say the right things or have the necessary information.
This is where the game's getting ready for me.
But I always enter by visualizing the final result.
You've both been very successful in your career.
How do you pass it on?
Laila Ali: I am very excited to be part of the T.J. Maxx project Maxx You Project, because I feel that this is an opportunity to do good.
A lot of women need inspiration, encouragement to pursue their dreams and goals.
We all have a champion.
It's actually about insanity and the possession of the tools you need, about yourself with the right people, people who've been able to achieve the things you're trying to accomplish.
Barbara Corcoran: One of the things I think I am doing very well is to inspire people.
That's why I was very excited when I was asked to work with Maxx You Project.
I try to light the flame of individuality and inspiration that we see here in the faces of all these people and give them practical advice on how to move forward.
Many people start to realize their dreams, but they tend to err at some point along the way.
So we try to help them focus on their goals.
Everything we teach is practical.
Business planning, even as simple as the elevator call, is all you need to set up a business.
What advice would you give to women who wish to make progress in the areas of men-to-men?
Laila Ali: I work in one of the most men-centred areas that is boxing.
To come after my father, who was a global icon and the best of all time, was quite alarming.
For me, the essence of the matter was actually to find its gift, its courage, its strength in itself.
The first thing I had to believe in was that I could get into a boxing circle and succeed.
At that moment, no one but me and my journey had been affected by any restrictions other than those which I had set in my own head.
If you believe in yourself and find your passion, no one can stop you.
Barbara Corcoran: The journey between finding inspiration and having an attitude like mine - "The New York Real Estate Queen" - and crossing the finish line is enormously long.
And in this interim phase, which is your career every day, a lot of talent is needed.
You don't have to deal with real estate for these gifts.
I am sure that in the area of Laila, too, it was necessary to decide what the right people were, the right managers, when to start, when to finish, when you have a lot of money that you can put in, what you can not, how hard you are willing to work.
These are all subjective decisions.
I'm trying to make these efforts a little more supportive, so these women really feel like, "Okay, I get it now.
Let me try.
Here are my three priorities."
When they leave with three main priorities to really make things happen, I go home smiling in bed at night.
What's on your nightstand right now?
Laila Ali: Too much trouble.
Journals, books, little prayer angel, my diary.
Probably a bottle of water.
Barbara Corcoran: My nightstand has a small green-responsible alarm clock, because I tried to break the habit of watching the phone every morning as the first thing.
That's why I got it.
That was cute.
But it never worked.
And he's still standing there.
And my phone's still on my nightstand.
What book are you reading now?
Barbara Corcoran: The eighth or ninth time "How to win friends and influence people".
It keeps me on the right track.
I think this is still the best book written in this field, no matter what your dreams are, dreams cannot be achieved without other people.
And it is possible to communicate with it today just like in the past.
I like to read it from time to time.
It'll help me get on the right track again.
Laila Ali: I'm studying in a nutrition school, which is why I'm reading the book "Wishless Diet".
It's about eating cereals and how they affect our bodies.
I'm very interested in that.
What is your best advice to cope with successes and failures?
Barbara Corcoran: Ignore the pessimists.
They meet in all kinds of different shapes.
You have to remove them from your brain vocabulary.
Stay away from the whiskers.
They're sucking you out of energy.
I feel like thieves.
They'll come in at night, grab your wallet and leave.
The pessimists will destroy the team in any team situation faster than you can blink, because people who pity themselves want others to feel bad.
They're pulling good people into a hole with them.
I am perfectly capable of avoiding all the negative people within a 50-km radius of myself, because my goal is to be positive and to take from life everything that gives me, and to accept everything I have to offer.
So why would I want to spend one minute on such people?
Laila Ali: must be consistent.
We will begin on many occasions with conviction that we will now take this path.
Let's do this, this and this.
But people don't follow it long enough.
Sometimes they give up just before they reach the last hill.
So I think we need to stay on course.
If you feel passionate about something, believe in something, you must be consistent.
And you have to do the hard work that success requires.
Barbara Corcoran: It takes a lot of effort to ensure consistency.
Do you know what it takes?
The completion of things.
If you start something, stop it.
Many are skilled beginners, but not very good graduates.
In Latvia, the largest number of non-nationals live in Daugavpils, Riga and Liepaja.
In Riga, there are 125 344, Daugavpils 14 266 and Liepājas 11,909.
Outside the large bird, the highest number of people without Latvian citizenship live in Jekabpils (2347) and Valmiera (1235).
At the beginning of 2017, 242 560 people lived in Latvia, who did not have Latvian citizenship.
In 2007, Latvia's stateless people lived in 392 816.
Jürgen Ligi recently referred to on Facebook: "The quote is a poor argument".
Therefore, I will not look back and I will not try to recall what has been done in history and what has been achieved for the reculture of human nature.
I will not assess whether these tests can be considered successful or failed.
I also avoid excessive references, although I rely on the thought of my most important teacher, Toomas Paul: all my thoughts have been borrowed from somewhere if only I could remember exactly where.
The most striking boost in Estonia today is the re-education of the Estonian citizen - the perfect person.
We're not raising her like we're raising a child in good faith that she's gonna be human.
We will raise him as the ruling class imagines it - what one person must be that he can live in Estonia and speak publicly.
The censorship is perfect.
Although the local ruling class changed partly a year ago, some methods of cultivation are as frightening as those of the previous ruling class, now impoverished nobles - their brutality is not at least below the previous ones.
They're just different.
Latvia’s beer is the brand drink of fine-tuning of the new era.
Mandatory by the Heads of State or Government 0.5 Promilli
The ruling class includes not only politicians who get paid for their work from the state, but also those self-conscious who make politics voluntarily (read: intentionally): they write opinion flags using the shape of Mihkel Mut, on Facebook, how horrible people around them live in Estonia, picketing, boycotting, juggling, sabotaged.
They only agree to stay at Echo Chamber (the English expression of people who live in a room where only their own Facebook friends, etc.) have the right opinions, but this is not possible in conflict in Estonia.
Still, there is a fellow roadman who thinks or does something that is unacceptable to the echo people.
And the word war is open and the cheering cannons are throbbing.
We have a lot of politicians who know exactly how many people can drink with whom to sleep, how to raise children, how to work, how to get a lot of pay, when to rest, what to eat, how to separate your mind, when to be sick, how to die.
In very important places.
If their public statements were to be heard other than what they said themselves, they would be angry, offended, hysterical.
The fact that people in many European countries drive a "full head" car, and that is legally permitted, does not alter their opinion.
Zero tolerance is the only tolerance in every area, but behind zero tolerance is not care, but hideous evil.
Classical hatred and racial hatred are the only things that fit me.
Holy politicians can open only the mouth, but never the heart.
They believe that every "measure" they use to make society better works and is worth trying.
Fortunately, we have clairvoyant, spiritual - disabled stuntmen who jump through every window without knowing the pain.
Therefore, it seems to us that some clever peasants open their mouths and are emotionally mutilated in a manor for it, that it makes sense.
Some words that will certainly send us to the mansion are gay, refugee, wife, violence, and work.
If you believe everything that self-sufficient officials, activists and politicians say and write (this is only a small part of all groups, but they are able to make fun of it so that society as a whole is deaf) the citizen is not only disgusting, lame and unpleasant, but also brainless, without a brain.
But don't believe, don't be forced to tolerate, don't tell me not to drink.
In any case, the Estonian person drinks as much as he wants, not as much as the state promises.
In any case, the Estonian person tolerates more than he is forced not to tolerate.
A person in Estonia not only changes his behaviour two months before the elections, so that, once the goal has been achieved, he can turn his back on his popularity diet again, not only in the mouth, but also exonerate what is quickly restoring the unpleasant pounds of brain fat.
Whoever does it differently is not the right Estonian.
I don't think any people can be re-educated.
I think it's possible to teach a person.
Drink reasonablely, love your family, be hard, polite, attractive companion, not only for friends, but for society as a whole.
To teach, you don't always have to fine, limit, ban, force, summon, corner, throw rotten eggs in the media mail.
The teacher must be an example.
A smoking politician is talking about tobacco harmfulness?
A cop who's out of speed on his own, he's fined me for crossing speed?
And then the colleague gets caught in the middle of something...
I have such a pervasive idea that maybe we should try to re-educate the ruling class once and for all.
Tell them not to drink in secret.
If you drink, drink publicly: In the Town Hall, in the sight of all the people.
To force speed only publicly - the rulers' cars, including private cars, be all red.
If you rule, rule as you rule yourself.
Maybe it's a shame if words and actions don't work together.
Or we can find out that we want the most hardy ones to rule us.
Because all of us Estonians are what we don't want to be.
Where do you run from yourself?
According to former prosecutors, leaking Trump's transcripts is probably a federal crime.
The person who leaked the phone records between President Trump and foreign leaders to the press was likely to commit a crime, on Thursday former prosecutors argued when the legislators called for the defendant to be identified.
"The unauthorized disclosure of these documents to the press is a crime," said former Columbia District Attorney Joe diGenova Fox News.
These different acts, which involve the disclosure of notes and transcripts of conversations between the President and foreign leaders, constitute a serious threat to national security.
The Washington Post announced on Thursday new details of the intense talks by the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on the basis of leaked documents.
In the first place, Trump told the Mexican Head of State to stop the public preaching that his government would not pay for the border wall.
According to the newspaper, the transcripts contained notes indicating that they have been classified by the commander-in-chief of the National Security Council.
The Post said that they had received comprehensive transcripts, which had been "assembled by the White House staff" and which were based on the records of the White House notebooks.
"There is a federal law that makes leaking classified information to an unauthorized person a criminal offence, a federal crime," said former New York Public Prosecutor Doug Burns at the telephone interview.
Although some of the details of these calls came to the public already in February, the publication of the transcripts marks a much greater blow to the White House, which is trying to reduce leaks.
The report was published by chance at a time when the leaders of the Trump administration were preparing to appear to the public on Friday to show their commitment to eradicating the leakers of classified information.
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions, State Intelligence Director Dan Coats, Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, and Head of National Counterintelligence and Security Centre William Evanina are expected to report to the public at the Justice Department headquarters.
It is not clear whether the Ministry of Justice is investigating the leak of The Post.
In order for someone to take responsibility for it, Burns said that "secure elements must be clearly proven".
He said that 'there may be clutters on this subject', referring to the investigation and decision not to prosecute the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
These considerations include the marking and history of the document and its precise classification.
In the case of classification, prosecutors shall examine whether the document was leaked to an unauthorized person in a manner that adversely affects the interests of the United States of America.
"If all this can be proven, people can undoubtedly be in a criminally vulnerable situation," said Burns.
"No doubt."
Speaking of Trump's phone transfers, DiGenova, who was the prosecutor of spy cases, said that such documents were "normally classified as a secret and above".
While claiming that these leaks threatened the ability of the U.S. government to pursue foreign policy, DiGenova asked the D.A. to convene a federal criminal jury to find the leakers.
He also said that there should be a court order in order to get records of the telephone calls from reporters and editors in The Washington Post - something that reporters would undoubtedly protest against.
Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee said on Thursday that there should be a criminal procedure in case of leaking classified information.
"The person who leaked them should be punished and fired," said Lee Fox News, "America's News HQ."
"This is unacceptable and such a thing should never happen."
Lee, who worked as a lawyer before being elected to the Senate in 2010, said that such a leak was a "crime, a very serious federal crime".
"This act should and should not only be accompanied by dismissal, but also by criminal proceedings, given that classified information is involved," he said.
Fox News was told that, at this stage, the Ministry of Justice's Friday's announcement could rather give an overview of what the Ministry of Justice expects to achieve rather than clarify certain procedures.
Last week, President Sessions criticised and publicly poured out his anger at the D.A.'s office, claiming that the latter had not made enough effort to find the leakers.
"I want the D.A. to be much tougher on leaks coming from security agencies," said Trump in the rose garden on 25 July.
The sessions themselves admitted last week to Fox News Tucker Carlson that he is not satisfied with the efforts made to investigate leaks that have repeatedly hindered the President since his inauguration.
"I have not been satisfied with the previous procedures and investigations of criminal leaks," said Sessions.
Even some people who are critical of the President have spoken against the leaks, saying that this behaviour is detrimental to foreign policy aspirations.
"The leaking of the transscript of the speech between the President and the foreign leader is unprecedented, shocking and dangerous," wrote David Frum in Atlantic on Thursday.
"It is extremely important that the President be able to communicate in confidence - and perhaps even more importantly, that foreign leaders understand that they can respond in confidence."
Senator Mark Warner (D-Va), head of the Senate Security Committee, also told The Daily Beast that the leak was "absolutely" worrying and that Congress should investigate it.
10 low advertising tricks to make food look more attractive
Since many foods are difficult to picture, the picture uses a different ingredient that deceives people - instead of glue or ice cream, for example, potatoes.
Youtube channel Top Trending provides an overview of what tricks are quite common in the advertising world.
When someone opens a popcorn pack in a commercial or takes a burger out of a box, a lot of good steam comes out of it.
In reality, the take is longer, and throughout this time hot food does not steam, because the steam comes from a high water content that, for example, is not available in the pastry products.
Therefore, cotton balls have been soaked in water in the packaging or in food and have the ability to absorb and store their own water.
In the immediate vicinity of the heat exchange they steam much longer than a burger or popcorn, and the product gets a freshly made appearance.
Potato powder is a great help to photographers because it does not melt in light or heat or significantly alter consistency like many other foods.
For example, instead of a cake cream filling or ice-cold ice cream, it can be a potato powder.
A little color and decorative elements, and the consumer has been deceived again.
The glue replaces the milk.
It's not easy to take a picture of milk, either, because it may not look that white on the photo.
Foods served with milk also quickly become bumpy inside.
For example, since morning cereals or mussels must look crispy and delicious in milk, glues are used instead of milk that do not penetrate through any of the flakes.
If restaurants can work hard to make meat so that the result is juiced and ripe, advertising will not do so.
However, the meat presented in the ad looks particularly attractive, as if it came directly from the grill.
Often, however, it is cooked on a finished pan or made in an oven, and stripes that imitate the grilling of the meat are drawn with shoe wax.
It's just as difficult to work with the cream as it is with the ice cream, because it tends to melt.
Fortunately, there is a product that is almost identical to the creamy appearance of a bearding foam.
So it may be on top of cakes or berries or inside a milkshake.
Even on the top surface of the fruit sold at the store, there may be a thin layer of wax that makes their appearance shiny.
However, it is not enough for the photo, and a deodorant is sprayed to add the light to the fruit.
Also, the sauces are not photogenic because they become more liquid over time or separate water from them, for example.
Here, however, there is a wax that has bright colors and a more permanent texture that allows you to take an attractive picture of your appetite.
The wax is likely also used in those pictures where the molten chocolate flows on top of the cake or ice cream.
If you notice in the advertisement a cake with an ideal cross-section, where the relationship between the bisque and the filling is perfect, there are probably some additional layers or pieces of cardboard used.
That's because when you cut the cake, the lice can spread and ruin the picture.
If, after cutting, the pastry is pushed into the cake and sprayed with a filling, it will make a more visual impression.
The cardboard and button needles are also used inside the burger to make sure that all the ingredients are correctly fixed so that they remain in place.
That's why a burger on a table doesn't look like a commercial.
Paper stuffed chicken.
In advertising, it looks juicey and full-bodied, but it may not even be ready for cooking.
To add a full impression, the chicken is stuffed with a full paper, sanded with a potato powder before it is mentioned, and then simply sprayed with a brown color.
Pancakes are especially poured in American commercials with maple syrup, as this picture creates a great deal of pancakes in humans.
In fact, the cakes quickly absorb the syrup and the flowing syrup disappears quickly from the photographer’s sight.
Therefore, each pancake is sprayed with a cleaner intended for the couch, which helps to prevent rapid absorption.
Often, it is not helpful, and thus, gold - brown engine oil is used, which is poured on hot pancakes and presented as syrup.
A former soldier was sentenced to sexual abuse by a prisoner for the murder of a suspected pensioner.
A former soldier was sentenced to at least 17 years in prison for the murder of a man he suspected of mistreatment of a woman he knew.
Richard Cassidy (70) was convicted in June of the murder of David Farish (75) in his home in Tweedbank, Roxburghshire, in February 2016.
Judge Summers called the murder "especially brutal" because there were 14 puncture holes in the victim's body.
Public defender Brian McConnachie said that the killing was caused by "momental madness", but he described the circumstances as "exceptional".
Cassidy heard that Farish had, for a long time, been sexually abused by a woman.
His lawyer said he went home to Farish and "friended" him in the hope of hearing a confession, not a plan to kill him.
Lord Summers claimed that Cassidy demonstrated signs of intent on the day of the attack and pointed to a report on social work which revealed that the defendant had completed military training in the special forces on how to infiltrate groups through friendship.
There were no charges against Farish.
The court reported that, after the murder, Cassidy himself contacted the police and turned himself in.
McConnachie said that most people have a hard time understanding that Cassidy is capable of murder.
The defense lawyer said, "He's never had any problems before in his life.
He lived a life of full value until the moment of his madness in February 2016.'
Cassidy's health is allegedly poor, and he's been arrested for a heart attack and stroke.
According to Lord Summers, he took into account the fact that Cassidy had no previous convictions and what he was allegedly told about Farish when he was sentenced to life with a minimum of 17 years in prison.
The Scottish police described the case as "a particularly offensive murder of men at a fragile age at his own home".
Detective David Pinkney said, "Although this punishment does not make his cruel act null and void, I hope it will offer David's family some sort of solution."
Monday was the last opportunity to propose a nice name for a rhino toad born early in June.
The zookeepers now have a large box of names to review in order to find the right one to solemnly declare on the day of the zoo’s birthday, August 25.
However, the name can still be given to the sons of bitches until the day of independence.
From the beginning of August, the entire rhino family sees walking alongside the yard garden at once.
And even though Father Kigoma runs around and moves horned garden posts from time to time, his mother won't be disturbed by Kibib, but the rhinoceros get a valuable lesson.
Although the height of births has passed, on August 1, a jacket and two domestic goats saw the light.
On the Kullimäe, on a warm summer day, you can get caught up in the bathing eagles.
Takins, with a peculiar appearance of goates, started running.
Another Vivacolor colour day took place at the zoo on Thursday.
A large number of good helpers painted the new camel house, the garden posts of the mother elephants’ large yard garden garden, and the father elephant’s terrace.
In order not to interfere with the painters, the mother elephants Fien and Dray spent time with the father elephant Carl.
On August 9, on the second day of the zoo, Aavo Otsa's trumpet band will be present.
In the zoo, you can buy a nostrils and minions and other wonderful memories for memory.
The proceeds of the sale of charity will be in support of the corresponding species conservation project.
On the tiger day last week, more than 1000 euros were collected for charity sales.
It is worth knowing: how to calculate the amount of sugar in the dairy product?
"The European Union's food labelling standards allow the packaging to identify the quantity of carbohydrates and the quantity of sugar, which is not equal to the white, so-called table sugar," confirmed Krista Kalbin, Estonian marketing director Valio.
According to her, milk products actually contain three types of sugar: lactose in milk, natural milk sugar, glucose in fruit, fructose, and added sugar, or sucrose.
However, bearing in mind a few simple basic truths, Kalbin said that the calculation of the quantity of added sugar contained in the product should not be difficult.
Firstly, it must be clarified whether it is a milk or an acidified milk product.
Normal milk and milk drinks contain about 5 grams of natural milk sugar, or 100 grams of lactose per product.
In oxidised milk products, yoghurt or kefibacteria have consumed some lactose during the oxygenation process and are therefore acidified in milk products on average 3,5g/100g of lactose per product.
"In order to calculate the quantity of added sugar, lactose must be calculated first," Kalbin said.
Now fructose and glucose from berries and fruit must be deducted from the quantity of sugar.
"In general, fructose and glucose in the flavoured milk product is approximately 0.3 grams in the case of a normal 3-4% fruit content, and especially in fruit products up to 1.5 grams per 100 grams," Kalbin said.
According to her, this simple calculation shows that the proportion of added sugar in yoghurts may not be more than twice the proportion of sugars indicated on the packaging.
The situation is slightly different for lactose-free products as they depend on the production technology.
Comparison of the most favourable spa packages: out of nightclub tickets to saunas
The mailman's consumer service compared the more favourable packages offered by spas to one person for one night on 11-12 August.
"The spa hotels are different levels and the range of services, so one comparison only on the basis of the price is very difficult," said Mario Sau, sales manager of OÜ Spa Tours.
Compared to spa accommodation, it is evident that the prices of the most favourable packages vary several times and there are choices for both a more demanding customer and a more modest holidayer.
For example, if only a passenger can spend 51 euros in a single room in Värska Spa with a buffet and breakfast and unlimited use of water park, gym and saunas, one person will receive 287 euros when visiting the Pädaste Manor in Muhumaa.
It includes accommodation in Double Deluxe category room, breakfast restaurant Alexander in winter garden and a half-day spa package.
In selecting and comparing different packages, account should be taken of the fact that a friend or a companion should go on holiday to get the most affordable price, since staying in two rooms is more favourable than taking a single room.
However, if you want to rest alone, you will be provided with special single rooms and double rooms for an extra charge.
If, in general, a non-partner passenger has to pay a fee of just EUR 20 for being alone in a double room, it is possible to find more favourable options by making compromises.
For example, in Fra Mare Thalasso Spa in Haapsalu, the package costs 86 euros by overnight stay in a single room, but if you wish, you will also be offered a more favourable option to stay in a double room, provided that, in the event of a lack of room, you are also provided with someone else by informing the customer in advance.
In this case, the price of the package is EUR 58.
To get the most favourable deal, it's worth being flexible.
The prices of packages are dynamic, i.e. they depend on the day of the week and the performance.
"In the case of the most favourable package, prices can vary from 112 to 248 euros," explained Triinu Steel, the sales and marketing manager of V SpaaHotel in Tartu.
He also drew attention to the fact that their hotels have a variable price, depending on the performance, and added that, in general, the customer receives the most favourable price by booking directly from their website or asking for the offer itself.
Since the summer season is the fastest for spas, it is worth planning a vacation in time to avoid the situation where the desired place has been sold out.
For example, on 11 August, only suites have been selected at Pärnu Hedon Spa and Strand Spa and Viula Manor in Lahemaa.
You don't have to look far for opportunities to spend a relaxing holiday: almost every major city in Estonia has one or more spas.
At the same time, it is worth investigating before buying the package, and at the same time, there is no major event in the vicinity, as it will increase prices immediately to the ceiling.
For example, until 11-13 August, the events of the White Lady will take place in Haapsalu.
At this time Haapsalu has many tourists, the demand for accommodation is very high, and at this time we have the prices of major events.
"Therefore, we do not have a low-priced or affordable package for sale at the time," commented Irene Välja, the manager of the spa hotel Laine.
The Chinese company that came to Estonia last year made a turnover of EUR 100 million.
The Chinese owner of agricultural production, Agritera, which only started operations last year, achieved almost EUR 100 million in turnover.
A profit of nearly EUR 2 million was earned, says Business Day.
The company's annual report shows that the sales revenue of Agritera OÜ, a wholesaler of agricultural production, amounted to EUR 100,6 million in 2016.
Profit was EUR 1,91 million.
A year earlier there was no economic activity in the company.
On average, 3 people were employed in the company last year, there were no employees in 2015.
Turnover per employee amounted to EUR 33.6 million, with an average gross fee of EUR 316 per month.
Jüri Kolk: rest all year long, so you don't need a vacation.
Of course, it was my fault that this rest was missed.
I guess I was a bit of an employee, too, but I guess the only person who thought I was indispensable.
It was your fault that my stupid sense of duty spread over my chest.
The quote at the beginning of this column is nice in that it is entirely true.
So it was - the new office that I started in March of the same year - that required work on its own, but something was so much better for me in this job that I recovered to a whole new life in three months, I rested myself.
It's still summer, vacation time.
It's time to make a New Year's promise, to review what's happened in life and what direction this whole thing's going to take.
"It's Christmas and the New Year's Eve for this!" calls some decent citizen out loud.
Maybe it is, but we all know from our experience that Christmas is not a good time to think about life and set goals.
All right, all I'm saying is for me - I can't make any changes on the New Year's Eve.
It's too hard for me.
Of course, there is happiness and joy in the Christmas season: I like knowing the beginning of the race for light, I like the Christmas lights, and Jesus too was a very nice attitude, a revolutionaryly-minded fellow.
Nevertheless, during Christmas I am usually very tired and sometimes stressed - even because of the dark.
Yeah, I do a lot of work in a free life, maybe more than I do in a fucking slaughterhouse, and I've been resting a lot.
Most of the time I've been running like a squirrel on a bike before Christmas - gifts, at least four Christmas parties, a little more load at work...
Considering also the constant social pressure to feel unconditional joy and peace in the heart, the difficulties of the Christmas age are obvious.
But a desperate and tired person is unable to make good decisions, long after all, to improve them.
Such things must still be done with more or less clarity.
A tired person may blow up an empty and loud promise, which will help to store the foundation of the future about as much as when buying a lottery ticket.
The promise that is intended to change something should be calmly thought through, it should benefit from it, it should be a plan.
The plan, so unlike the promise, includes not only a code of conduct but also a few small setbacks.
That's why I'm saying that the best time to make promises is now, in the summer.
You just need to relax and ask why this fatigue is as great (if it is).
If you don't make yourself feel like a calf who got out of the table on holiday, a couple of weeks will be enough to find a hook in your life that deserves to be twisted straight, and figure out how exactly it's done.
I think it is important to live as long as possible so that I do not need to rest on a regular basis, not once a year.
So the holiday would be an extra pleasure, not a box stop necessary for survival, during which time enough is being loaded to withstand the next year somehow.
I recommend at least one simple summer promise to everyone - if you have to get up at a certain time the next morning, then get some sleep early.
I believe that if one in ten Postimees reads my recommendation, life in Estonia would be significantly better.
I intend to follow my own advice.
We've already got a Thursday work week, but not the way we expect it.
Photo: Scanpix, PantherMedia / Wavebreakmedia ltd
Many Estonians already have a Thursday week, which they do not know about.
But not as they would expect, says Business Day.
It has been created by modern workspace planning, i.e. an open office.
According to Harvard Business Review, employees spend almost 1.5 hours a day, or almost a whole working day a week, in the Wallless Office.
However, if four working days and three rest days are taken into account during the Thursday work week, such a forced solution will be worse than this.
The hours taken from working time have been furnished with concentration difficulties, mixing work, growing irritation and anxiety, and the loss of the working paper, instead of family and hobby or holiday time.
The third festival day of the Week is being sent by strong wind.
That's how the camera eyes of the evening paper photographer got caught up in the face of a wretched seaman who's trying to fly the wind in his trolls.
Because of the wind, many festival visitors say that their mouths and eyes are full of sand.
How a man built a theme park that cost his daughter 51 million dollars
A father in Texas discovered that there was no theme park where his disabled daughter could play.
So he decided to build one himself.
Gordon Hartman had just come out of the pool on family vacation when his 12-year-old daughter Morgan approached other children playing in the water.
He tried to make friends with them, but they quickly left the pool.
Hartman thinks they're scared because they don't know how to treat a disabled person - Morgan has a five-year cognitive understanding and also a certain form of autism.
This incident has been haunting him.
"Morgan is a wonderful young girl.
Seeing him always brings a smile to his mouth, and he certainly wants to hug.
But there have been many times where we have not been able to take him to different places," he says.
Hartman and his wife, Maggie, asked other parents where they could take their daughter - somewhere where she would feel comfortable and others would also feel good in their relationship with her.
"We came to the conclusion that such an inclusive place does not exist," says Hartman.
It therefore decided in 2007 to build it itself.
The former real estate developer sold his home-building companies in 2005 to establish The Gordon Hartman Family Foundation – a non-profit-making company that helps people with disabilities.
He then began the creation of the first highly accessible theme park in the world.
"We wanted to create a theme park where everyone can do everything that can be played by people with special needs and no special needs," says Hartman.
He called for doctors, therapists, parents, and other disabled and disabled people to consult on the facility.
They were set up in a ten-haced abandoned career in San Antonio, Texas.
The park, Morgan's Wonderland, paid $34 million ($26 million) and was opened in 2010.
The attractions include a fully accessible view wheel, an adventure playing field and a mini-train.
Visitors often tell Hartman that they were only able to experience such attractions for the first time.
There is also a carousel, which has carriages specially designed for wheelchairs, which move up and down alongside animals.
Hartman, however, finds that Morgan was afraid of driving at first.
"When we opened up, he didn't dare go to it.
He didn't understand why it goes around and why animals go up and down," says Hartman.
It took three years before Morgan agreed to go to the carousel.
"At first he just stood near it, then he sat on the animal, but we didn't start the race.
It was a slow process, but now he likes to drive.
Getting over something that scared him meant a lot to him.
The small things you get when you play make a big difference."
Since its opening, Morgan's Wonderland has visited over a million people from 67 countries and all 50 American states.
A third of the staff is disabled and entry is free of charge for anyone with a medical condition.
"I realized Morgan was one of the lucky ones, because he has many things that are necessary for him.
I didn't want the price to be an obstacle to other people with special needs," Hartman says.
"We open up every year, knowing that we're going to lose at least a million dollars (750 000) and we're going to have to make it back with the help of the collections and partners."
This year, the theme park was extended to Morgan's Inspiration Island, or the opening of a fully accessible water park.
"In July, fewer people visited the park because wheelchairs became too hot.
So we decided to set up a water park aside," Hartman says.
In some parts of the island, warm water has been used to help people with muscle problems.
Watertight motorised wheelchairs are available that operate with compressed air, not with batteries.
It's possible to ride a boat on the river.
The water park paid a total of 17 million dollars (13 million pounds).
"Last night, a man from Inspiration Island came to me and just held my hand," says Hartman.
"He referred to his son, who has serious special needs, and began to cry.
He said his son had never been able to play in the water before."
Hartman says that three of each of the four parks are not handicapped, and the park has exactly the effect he hoped for.
"This helps people to understand that although we are different in certain ways, we are actually exactly the same," he says.
"I saw a girl in a wheelchair go to another girl, no special needs, and they started playing together.
It was really awesome."
Hartman does not intend to open any more parks, although he has received hundreds of letters by post and e-mail from people who would also like to park in his own neighborhood.
Instead, in San Antonio, he focuses on providing educational facilities for young people with special needs.
"I know there are many different organisations that are trying to build something like Morgan's Wonderland elsewhere, and we will continue to work with them," he adds.
He's still taking Morgan to the theme park with him - Morgan's a bit of a celebrity there now.
"When he comes here, he's like a rock star!
Many people want to talk to him and take a picture with him, he manages it well," says Hartman.
Morgan, now 23 years old, is getting better and better.
"He's talking more now, and most of his physical problems have been solved with numerous operations.
We're so proud that he's come this far."
When Morgan visits the park, he likes to play on the swings and sandals most, not knowing how much he's helped others.
"Morgan knows that the park has been named after him, but I don't think he understands what it really represents and how it has changed lives," says Hartman.
"He doesn't realize that the way he's dealt with things in life has made him a real source of inspiration."
U18 head coach Vaido Rego: play-off game can decide one or two shots
In the Estonian U18-age basketball team, Poland 68:63 defeated the home EM B-division quarter final, according to Chief Coach Vaido Rego it was a genuine play-off meeting.
The game was rough.
Both teams had done their homework, scored hard.
The game comes with a better nerve.
Play-off can be one or two shots game", discussed Rego.
You can win, but the coach's still looking for something to fix first.
It's always a nuriseda.
Some of our mistakes were not justified, the opponent received light free throws and lived on them.
This has happened to us before - if you go aggressively to defend it, there is a danger of overburdening it.
Let's draw our own conclusions," Rego said.
He used nine players today, and Robin Stone, who missed a meeting because of an injury, was still on the bench.
These decisions are made on a continuous basis.
The stone carried morning training and pre-game heating, but was still not 100% ready," the tutor explained.
Tomorrow, at 6:15 p.m., Estonia will meet with the United Kingdom in the semi-final, who defeated Bulgaria today at 76:73.
The winner of this game will raise the A-division for the next summer of the U18 age class in his country.
Video: Vassiljev has already created another penalt for a new club
Piast remained in the home field game for the ninth minute against Wroclaw Slask, but he was able to pin 20 minutes later.
Vassiljevi had an excellent opportunity to secure Piast’s first victory in the season.
Four minutes before the normal time, the half-defendant hit the penalt.
The match ended with 1:1 pins.
Piast has collected two points in four rounds and is placed on the top of the league, or 15th.
How do you keep sex exciting when you're trying to have a baby?
So it is very important to keep the passion bursting even when you are trying to create a new life.
Female First gives advice on how to make sex not appear an annoying obligation.
Don't take that as an obligation.
This could happen to any couple who are trying to get pregnant.
Sometimes it may take years to get pregnant.
Having sex on an order takes away spontaneousity and romance.
Try to be spontaneous!
Women often feel unable to enjoy "normal" sex at the end of the cycle when it is known that no positive results will come.
This creates tensions in relation to the relationship, which in turn leads to a decrease in sex and less sex means, of course, an even greater chance of not getting pregnant.
But men feel that they must be able to "express" when they are required to do so.
If you know your fruitful days ahead of you, it can be helpful to plan something romantic with your boyfriend.
Whether it's a special dinner or just spending time together - enjoy each other!
Consider a fruitful period.
From the point of view of reproduction, there is no point in having sex when the ovulatation has taken place, but in order for your relationship to be fair, try to have sex for the sake of joy in infertile days.
Although there is no evidence that pregnancy is more secure than a woman can have an orgasm, do not forget it!
Remember, each couple is different.
Everyone can handle baby-making stress differently.
Some men want to be familiar with the woman's cycle, others prefer not to know that they do not feel pressure to "enact".
No one knows better than you do how best to fit you.
Find your solution!
Studies have shown that a higher success rate is available to couples who have sex every few days, but not every couple can hold that density.
The most important thing is to find the pattern that suits you best as a pair.
IAAF warns that fraud will be monitored in the London World Championships
On Friday, the world championships will begin in London, and athletes will be in a lot more light than ever in connection with doping canals.
These World Cups are the first to be guarded by the new body, Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU), which also monitors corruption, gambling and counterfeiting of results.
"It is not possible to rule out that human nature does not allow such things to happen.
However, we can say that we have the best practices and the best anti-doping program that can be at the moment based on information and data collection, and we can see the result after the event," said David Howman, the representative of AIU.
AIU has allowed 19 athletes to compete as neutral athletes, about 190 Russian athletes who are caught in drugs.
Review: Levadia destroyed the Paide City Team in the home field
Levadia has put herself in a difficult position because, in the previous round, the foreigner was surprisingly lost to the future of Viljandi, and the table leader Flora took advantage of the opportunity offered by slipping to seven points away.
But behind the back is the same stick as Levadia, but the Nõmme Kalju.
During the summer transition window Paide still misses the captain and the central lander Andre Frolov.
Of the last seven games, only two draw points have been picked, the league is the eighth in place - from Tartu Tammikas to four in the ground and from the future to four in the front.
In the first game between the two of us this year, Paide lost to levadia, 0:7 and 2:5.
"My watch died, but I didn't," the actor, Raivo E. Tamme, had a broad smile on Ironman's 70.3 finals.
True, the whole half-long triathlon didn't give up on the smile.
Moreover, running 21.1 km, he was in a conversation, saying, "I talked to one person during the run, a man ran by and wondered, "Lord, you can still talk!"
On the runway, Raivo, who had the energy to tell the story, took over a few times.
Coach's recommendation.
"Ain-Alar Juhanson said that you can walk up the hill, that there is no point in pushing to run, because there are such rises and there is no difference in time whether you run or take a quick walk," says the actor, that he took the advice words of the triathlon supervisor.
He was also able to take his breath off when he walked, and thus, even after crossing the finish line, he was able to share interviews without breathing to the left and right.
It's like there's not a 1,9 km swim, a 90 km ride, and a 21,1 km run.
"I think my training is the kind of thing I can enjoy this competition," he admits, starting with the trainings in January and losing 16 kilograms of his body weight today in a peaceful way.
And as for the interviews, it was my wish to be able to give the interviews after the finish.
I've been able to give interviews after every competition, and I was hoping it would be nice to be able to do it after Otepää Ironman.
I thought it would be all right if I wasn't on the ground after Ironman."In contrast to being on a frightful track-ground, Raivo offered a very different picture by crossing the finish line: his hands triumphantly toward heaven and his face with a sincere triumph.
There was also a reason: Raivol took 46 minutes and 24 seconds to swim 1,9 km, 90 km to ride a bicycle for 3 hours and 32 minutes and 21,1 km to run for 2 hours and 18 minutes.
"My heart is now given to a triathlon," says Raivo, who already cried out in the finale, that he gave the sport a finger, and it took the ring in the jacket.
I already registered myself to Gran Fondo on August 20 - 230 kilometers from Tallinn to Tartu with a bike!
So tomorrow we're going to practice again!
Disney's long-standing advisor and manager Marty Sklar died at 83 years old.
Sklar, who died in his home in the Hollywood Hills neighbourhood in Los Angeles on 27 July, maintained ties with the company after his retirement in 2009, which was scheduled for the 54th anniversary of the opening of Disneyland.
Last year, he became the only member of the troupe on the opening day of Shanghai Disney in China (so the company invites its employees) who has participated in the opening of all 12 Disney parks around the world.
And less than two weeks before he died, he attended a Disney fan assembly in D23, sharing reminders of Disneyland.
His death was reported by Disney Company, not to mention the reason.
He was 83 years old.
Sklar's position as editor of The Disneyland News was temporary, but he returned to Disneyland after his U.C.L.A. graduation in 1956 to work on it in the advertising department.
He soon became the main shadow author of advertising materials, dedication, souvenirs, speeches, slogans, presentations, and short films, such as a book that helped the company to gain approval for the construction of Walt Disney World and Epcot in Central Florida.
He also worked with Walt and his brother Roy on Disney's annual reports.
"These were quite a showdown times for a person who only approached his 30th birthday and had only six or seven years of college graduation," Sklar wrote in his autobiography "Dream It! Do It: My Half-Centure Creating Disney's Magic Kingdoms" (2013).
However, despite Walt Disney’s trust in Sklar in writing, he appointed Sklar at the 1964 World Fair in New York, where Disney Company designed exhibitions and attractions.
Sklar wrote Walt Disney a story about Ford's pavilion attraction for Magic Skyway, where animathronic dinosaurs and cavemen could be seen and which was their main link to large corporate sponsors.
It was the beginning of Sklar's second act at the company.
He was increasingly associated with Walt Disney's legacy, who died at the end of 1966 long before the opening of Walt Disney World in 1971 and Epcot in 1982.
After Walt Disney died of lung cancer at 65 years of age, Sklar was returned to the writing world when he was told that the company's executives had not prepared the public address, although "it wasn't a secret that Walt was dying", as he writes in his autobiography.
Sklar felt frustrated that he had to write a statement signed by Roy Disney, but he realized that a lack of planning was a sign that Walt Disney's death had paralyzed the company's leaders.
"In reality, they were all scared to death," wrote Sklar.
Martin Adrian Sklar was born in February in New Brunswick in New Jersey.
His father, Leon, was a teacher and mother, with a maiden named Lilyn Fuchs, worked at the company Johnson & Johnson before the family moved to Long Beach in California when Marty was 12.
After high school, he had several temporary jobs, for example, he worked at Douglas Aircraft, as an ice cream collector at the burger restaurant drive-in and as a parcel driver for postal services.
But in May of 1955, when his third year in U.C.L.A. ended, Sklar received a message calling Disney's marketing and advertising director E. Cardon Walker.
At that time Sklar U.C.L.A. was the new editor-in-chief of the student paper The Daily Bruin.
Walker asked him to come to a job interview for the job interview for the creator and editor of The Disneyland News.
Walker says the theme park will be opened soon.
And it needs him.
Walker hired her after a 20-minute interview.
Sklar had to prove to Walt Disney that he knew what he was doing.
"I've been working there for two weeks, and I had to submit a page concept to Walt Disney," he recalled in his pocket television broadcast on Disney Avenue's website.
"If Walt hadn't liked it, he'd have thrown me out the door and hired a professional.
But luckily, Walt liked it.
I was 21.
That was scary.
I had never worked on a professional level."
Sklar format Walt Disney (and also some other people) lessons at one point as "Miki's Ten Commandments", or the theme park management manifesto.
The commands include, for example, the following.
Try "to step into visitors' shoes" to experience attraction like them.
Just tell one story at a time for each attraction.
The theme entertainment expert Bob Rogers called Sklar's once "the debtor's apprentice" - the role that Miki-Mir played in Disney's film "Fantasia" (1940) - because he had mediated Disney's philosophy to three generations of designers.
His wife, Leah Gerber, daughter Leslie Sklar, son Howard, and four grandchildren.
Sklar was Disney's dedicated leader.
He regularly wore a three-card Miki-Hiire watch (showing him time in Los Angeles, Paris and Tokyo) and a Miki-Hiire gold ring.
And he never forgot anything Walt Disney had taught him.
When Disney Company developed the California Adventure Park Children's Area, Sklar reminded planners that they added activities that parents and children could do together, as Walt Disney had demanded.
"I reminded everyone that Disneyland existed at all because Walt had a habit of taking his daughters on a ride to Diane's and Sharon's Griffith Park with a carousel," he said to The Los Angeles Times in 2002, "and Daddy had to sit on a parking lot and eat peanuts and popcorn while the kids were driving alone."
Police took over 200 people to the station during the Weekly.
In total, more than 20 crimes were recorded in Pärnu City during the festival days.
There is a reason to associate around half of them with the music, and in addition to the use of violence, large amounts of possession of narcotics and two drunk driving were recorded.
A hundred of the misdemeanor proceedings initiated were mainly related to the use or possession of minor or prohibited substances that consumed alcohol.
There was a letter of theft and a violation of public order.
Police officers brought over 200 people to the police station for various reasons.
About half a hundred of them were minors, and the main reason for moving to the police station was alcoholic beverages.
Last year, more minors were brought to the station.
A half a hundred people were also taken to Kainenmo, or as much as in the previous year.
Andres Sinimeri, the head of the Pärnu Police Department, has said that the numbers mentioned above are expected in view of the large crowd.
As in previous years, we were thoroughly prepared this weekend.
We included additional forces from elsewhere in the prefectures, police detectives and auxiliary police officers to ensure that we were ready to react quickly.
Most of the situations were resolved with a word, and it was enough to communicate with citizens by the law enforcement authorities.
"It's obvious that there's not a lot of bad things left, because the police were in town to see and feel a lot of things," said Bluemer.
His view was very positive that the minors who had been drinking alcohol were apparently fewer and that young ones proved that they could celebrate too.
He congratulated the top-level team of the security company who took care of security at the festival.
I would like to thank all the festival visitors who kept themselves politely up and had a safe party.
"I would also like to thank the local people who, with their understanding, contributed to the success of the major festival," the police leader said.
In Pärnu Police Station, the owners are waiting for the objects found in the city and festival area on the weekend.
According to Annika Pärnu, the head of the Pärnu service responsible for the return of findings at the festival, there were fewer items lost this year than last year.
In the festival police tent, more than half of the findings were returned to the owners.
The highest number of bank cards, identity documents, mobile phones and keys were lost within three days.
"At the moment, 13 other mobile phones, three wallets, laptop, a smartbell and several car keys are waiting for the owner in the station," listed Pärnu.
A 101-year-old man jumped off a plane.
World War II veteran Verdun Hayes recently received a military reward to celebrate the skydiving that destroyed his world record.
In fact, at the age of 101 and 38, the man committed a violent act, becoming the oldest person in the world who had committed a parachute jump.
The group is pushing the government to agree on the transitional terms of Brexit
One of Britain’s largest business lobby groups encourages the government to stop dancing around Brexit’s outskirts.
The Institute of Directors (IoD) appealed to the government to conclude a "transition agreement" to make progress with Brexit smooth.
It is desirable for the government to create a bridge between leaving the EU and setting up new trade agreements.
The group warned that, without such a contract, business would be faced with a "short-term chaotic fluctuation on the edge of the rock".
They criticised the government's involvement in all kinds of speculative disputes regarding the transition.
In recent weeks, members of the government have expressed controversial views on how long the transition period will last and what it will lead to.
The IoD report 'Speeching the Brexit gap - opportunities for transition' states: 'In order to bridge the problem far away, the government must create a strategic debate around this issue.
This could minimise the growing confusion and uncertainty in this area."
Gerard Lyons, an economist and a group of Economists for Brexit leader, however, this week described the concern over "the rock edge fluctuating" Brexit as "the story of the pancakes", which resembles the fear of the Y2K computer software error in the change of the millennium.
The Chancellor of State Philip Hammond warned in June: "There is a large number of business investments that are delayed until companies see more clearly the likely outcome of these discussions."
Allie Renison, Head of the IoD EU and Trade Policy, said: "The Chancellor has the right to worry about the delay of business investments.
This is one of the most frequently considered changes to be addressed in connection with Brexit, alongside the relocation of operations into the EU.
The latter shall apply in particular to members of the IoD Northern Ireland who are currently considering co-location or relocation."
IoD offers a number of options, including the following. Extension of the Article 50 agreement from March 2019
Accession to the European Economic Area
Consent to stay longer in the EU's legislative field
Establishment of a transitional customs agreement similar to the EU Customs Union
Renison said: "IoD offered these opportunities in connection with the transition, hoping that it would trigger an appropriate debate on how best to complete Brexit.
The prioritisation of intermediate arrangements and thereby the mitigation of the risks of exit from the EU mean that short-term chaotic fluctuations at the cliff edge will not diminish future opportunities."
Russia's railway is investigating the possibility of launching a St. Petersburg-Kaliingrad-Berlin passenger train
The Russian railway is investigating the possibility to set up the Berlin-Peterbur train line through Kaliningrad, and Viktor Golomolzin, Director of the Kaliningrad train, informed Interfax Severo-Zapad.
Travel traffic monitoring is saying that, from an economic point of view, it is hardly possible to reboot the Kaliningrad-Berlin trains.
And we offer another route, Berlin-Kalininingrad-Peterburi.
Technical possibilities exist for this in terms of both infrastructure and rolling stock," said Golomolzin.
Golomolzin also noted that there are already Russian trains that can switch track gauges and continue to travel on European track gauges.
Golomolzin considers this to be a forward-looking direction, as the people of St Petersburg and the entire north-western part of Russia now have to travel to Germany through Moscow and Brest.
As a possible option, the route will be discussed through Latvia, and Latvia's Delfi has been confirmed by Māris Ozols, the press representative of the Latvian railway (Latvijas Dzelzceš), who said that there is no specific decision at the moment, but the option is under discussion.
The Latvian railway, together with the partners, including the Russian railway, is looking for an opportunity to increase competitiveness in the service of passenger flows so that rail transport can compete with road transport.
Pakistani Hindus can't find asylum in India
After 70 years of the greatest population migration since the separation of the two countries, the prices still move from Pakistan to India.
Tens of thousands of people, who do not even have the legal right to work in India, are already waiting for them in the camp on the border between two countries.
So many people have no choice but to fall illegally near temporary habitats - the Indian authorities follow the movements of the border aliens from the other side very closely.
Most of Pakistan's arrivals do not expect such a reception.
No job, no house, no money, no food.
There we worked in the fields, we were peasants.
This is where people like us are forced to break stones to make a living," said the 81-year-old in Johda.
For us, the fragmentation is not over.
The Hindus are still trying to return to their country.
And when they come here, they have nothing," added an elderly man living near the town of Jodhpur in the field camp.
After India’s independence from British colonial power in 1947, over 15 million people lost their homes.
The separation caused a month - long wave of violence in which at least a million people lost their lives because of religious hatred.
In the midst of the blood chaos, Hindus and Sikhs fled from the newly formed Pakistan, while Muslims moved in the opposite direction.
Despite emigration, the Hindus are still one of the many minority groups in Pakistan.
In various estimates, they account for about 1.6 per cent of the country’s population of 200 million.
Many of them complain of constant discrimination and fear kidnapping, rape, and forced marriages.
"The persecution began shortly after the breakup", said Jódás, whose family moved only a few months before the two countries broke up to escape the drought to the current Pakistani territories.
Not a day has passed since we could have lived in peace.
I wanted to come back to live among my Hindu brothers.
The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Mod, has said that he wants to make it easier for the religiously persecuted to find asylum in India.
Last year, the government started to allow immigrants to apply for citizenship in their place of residence, earlier the whole business went through central government.
Hindus who have relocated from Pakistan to India will have the opportunity to gain a high-speed citizenship after seven years of residence.
However, due to bureaucratic delays, this process is often much more time-consuming.
Khanaramji, 64, left Pakistan in 1997 and became a national of India in 2005.
According to him, however, many people have given up and returned to Pakistan because they see that they do not have a good life in India.
The government doesn't offer any support.
We're like cattle without the owner.
We're just trying to survive on our own," said Khanaramji.
But the scepticism of the authorities is even worse than poverty.
Those who do not have citizenship must suffer the harassment of intelligence agencies.
They are always treated as suspects and Pakistani agents," he explained.
In 2014, Singh Sodhal, a charity dedicated to helping Hindus in Jodhpur, Pakistan, had come under great expectations of Mod, but now he has had to be disappointed.
During the Mod regime, tensions between India and Pakistan have increased, causing the most affected migrants.
"The lives of them are going to hell," said Sodhal.
For many, such treatment is better than life in Pakistan.
Horoji and two grown - up sons fled to India two years ago because he had begun to get death threats from his Pakistani neighbours.
"In order to save our lives, we had to flee to India," said 65-year-old Horoji, whose grandparents were from the current Indian territories, but found themselves breaking up the country on the wrong side of the border.
My grandfather moved to the other side for work.
But he told us to move to India at the right time, because he knew that the future could be dangerous to Hindus.
I think we've been pretty good.
We have done well with our work and work," says Andres Sinimer, Head of Pärnu Police, how the first two days of the Weekly have worked for them.
The Blue Sea says that today, there are patrol officers and rapid responders on the streets, and they are also communicating with people - perhaps they have questions and they also want to know how to become a quick responder.
In two days, the police have had to deal with a few fights and also drug cases.
"There have also been a few large amounts of drug treatment, but we're going to make a summary when the Weekly is over," says the Bluemer.
About a hundred people have been through the Pärnu Police Department for two days.
Fortunately, the police didn't need to solve extreme cases.
By the way, Blue Mer says that when the sky comes out of the rain, it doesn't have much work to do.
One of Haapsalu's police fieldmen has ever said that rain is like an extra patrol.
The Pärnu Police Department has also set up a headquarters in the Weekly area, where you can take the things you found, and from there you can also request your missing things.
By the way, the police even lost one of their necessary gadgets delivered by good people.
Watch the video that Andres said to the Blue Mer's evening paper.
Several of Emmy's nominated stars and producers, Neal Baer, paid $4.35 million for a home in Hollywood Hills West, which is rooted in the atomic age.
In 1945, in the modernist style of the middle of this century, Josef Van der Kar designed the house and named it the Wohlster House according to its original owners, the nuclear strategy Albert and Roberta Wohlster.
The 255-square-metre building, which is situated by the gate-limited entrance route, has wide glass slides that open to the garden, terrace and inner courtyard.
In the living and dining room there are cork floor coverings, fireplaces and mobile panels that open in the kitchen.
The main part of the house consists of three bedrooms and three bathrooms.
There is also a separate guest house on the property, where you can view the huge fish pond and the sleeping pool.
There is also a bathroom and additional storage room in the separate building.
Albert Wohlstitter was a powerful nuclear strategy during the Cold War.
Roberta Wohlsteter's analysis of intelligence failures prior to Pearl Harbor's attack was also quoted by the Committee of Inquiry on 11 September.
The Wohlstetters have advised the Presidential Administrations of both Republicans and Democrats, including John F. Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis.
They received the presidential medal of freedom from Ronald Reagan in 1985.
Baer is best known for his work in TV dramas "Fast Hospital" and "For the Law: Sex Crime Investigation Unit".
Real estate brokers were Mike Deasy and Sara Clephane from Deasy/Penner and Partners.

The plane drew a perfect image of itself over the U.S.
The pilot took a passenger plane to a piggy nationwide flight over the United States and even managed to have some fun on the route.
The real-time flight data of the aircraft indicated that it was not just a straight line or a curve, but a sequence of flight paths, which formed an image of the aeroplane as connected.
The BOE004 flight left the Boeing Field Airport, based on a real-time flight tracker Flightradar 24, Seattle also left the airport at approximately 15.40 p.m. on Wednesday.
Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner took eastward over Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota before changing course sharply and flew southwest.
From the map, the strange route of the aeroplane represents a two-engine passenger aeroplane.
According to Boeing, the flight is part of the 18-hour "sustainability" test of the aircraft.
"In lieu of flying with any pattern, the testing team released its imagination by riding on a route that formed a 787-8 entourage of 22 states," said Boeing Company's representative to the portal RT.com.
"Dreamliner's nose points to Puget Sound, where Boeing Commercial Airplanes' home is located.
The wings extend from North Michigan to South Texas near the Canadian border.
The tail touches Huntsville i Alabama," he added.
Boeing’s long-distance aircraft, 787-8 Dreamliner, was introduced in 2009.
The aeroplane can accommodate up to 242 passengers and can fly more than 13 600 km.
Since the pilot used the radar as a personal canvas, the flight was of infinite interest to the aircraft monitors online.
Some suspected it was a test flight, others suggested it could be a strange coincidence.
Multifilms affecting the clothing style of Estonian children
If in Europe and America, like children, what is often shaped by the children of royal families or celebrities, then Estonian parents choose clothes for their children based on what happens in cinema.
British little prince Georg is about to become a real fashion guerrilla, like the Duchess Cahterine.
Just like his mother, the prince can fire a real shopping madman with his clothes, which has even become his own concept - the effect of Prince George.
The last such adventure took place a few weeks ago on a visit to the royal family in Poland, where George wore a blue-red trig with 10 euros in the Spanish brand Tizza, which the crazy parents bought from the brand in 24 hours.
There are probably not many shoppers from Estonia, because the lates of the king's children are supposed to leave our parents completely cold.
Anna Ansmitt, Communication Manager of the Chamber of Commerce, notes that children of star couples and foreign fashion trends generally do not affect our parents' purchases to their Mudi.
In Estonia, the biggest indicator of the purchase of children's goods is films, cartoons and YouTube channels.
So the most popular products in recent years are fingertips, multika "Frozen" characters games, dolls, clothes, dancing dogs or cats, peeling penguins and so on.
At the same time, he confirms that in Estonia, if you wish, your children can be dressed like European princes or princesses.
The Central Party does not recommend the Savisaari Ready Union
The leaders of the districts of the Centre Party across Estonia made a turn to the public and to the partners of the Party, in which they are invited to vote in favour of the Centre Party, not the electoral alliances.
In particular, this message is intended for those who are considering the Edgar Savisaari electoral union and the Central Party.
How Princess Diana used her makeup as a weapon
When I think about Princess Diana's make-up, the first thing I know is the eyeliner.
Younger-aged girl blue.
Later a fat black line in his Martin Bashir's "Panorama" interview, whose effect was devastating when he looked up through the thick eyelashes, bringing an audible immortal phrase, "There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a little too crowded."
Large and wet eyes surrounded by his glare, pale in the face with a thick black line, made him look like a wounded animal.
That's the effect he was trying to achieve.
Outside the public, Princess Diana never wore much makeup, at least not according to modern standards.
It was not just that he needed it - he was, of course, beautiful - but that he saw an tedious obligation in it, something about work rather than pleasure.
In public, he may have worn a thick layer of makeup.
Once, he arrived at the offices of Conde Nast, the publishers of Vogue, carrying a thick, almost orange layer of makeup.
He apologized, saying that his skin must shine from the sun, because if he went out "normally", then the holocaust photographers would take pictures of him, and then everyone would make accusations that he looked "unsuffered", "tired", "tired" and "tired".
That's why Diana went to the solarium three times a week using her home machine.
Of course, for health reasons, such a course would be bad, but for Diana this was a useful purpose - it allowed her to show the world her sunny nature, even though the black clouds and lightning filled her insides.
One of the most likely mistakes of the royal family was to think that if they approved him as Charles’s husband, they would have a beautiful, beautiful genome with only sugar wool in the brain.
But the reality was the opposite.
He wasn't supposed to be the best in school, but when it came to creating an image, he was a five-year-old student.
For Diana, the importance of hair and makeup was that they could be used to convey mood or feeling.
Otherwise, he didn't have the slightest interest in them.
His friend Rosa Monckton - Diana was his youngest child’s godmother - remembers that makeup was nothing they used to talk about.
"I only remember that," he said, "how relieved he felt at those times when we went to rest together and he didn't have to make his own makeup."
Today, we tend to think of makeup as something that improves her appearance, but looking back on Diana’s career, it is clear that she used it as a tool of powerful communication.
The moments when he felt the most freeest were his own, the moments when he was also the most natural, wearing very little makeup.
In 1993, along with his two young sons in Thorpe's park, he was wet and laughed from the heart like any other mother who spends the day with children.
Four months after the announcement of his separation with Charles, he finally looked a little worried and "usual".
Or in later years, pulling out of the gym, the hair set back, shaped legs in bicycles, face reddish from training, health and life force blowing from each of his pores.
Toward the end of his life, when he began to make his independence pay and his confidence grew, we saw more and more such Diana.
He joined Halo Trust and walked through the Angolan minefield in January 1997.
At the time of his 35-year-old, hair soft and natural, face almost completely makeup-free, he probably looked more beautiful than ever, remembering this bright and hopeful young girl who smiled at the engagement photo back 15 years ago.
Diana was just getting to her best years.
In early times, young Diana Spencer had a dreamy pre-Raffael character.
But it didn't take long for the "prince certification" process to begin, which was directed mainly by the press and the palace, to make Diana a refined young girl who would be worthy of her new status.
Part of this included Clayton Howard, a veteran make-up artist, who was often used by Lord Snowdon at photo sessions.
Howard met with the jealous Diana for the first time at the Kensington Town Hall in Snowdon to capture an official engagement picture for Vogue.
At that moment, in the late 1980s, Diana was just an empty canvas.
His finest beauty products were from The Body Shop, such as Elderflower's eye gel.
Howard used Max Factor's makeup cream with Sheer Genius tone Honey Touch and Max Factor's cheekbone tone with Frosted Coral.
To the eyeholes, he wore Elizabeth Arden’s tones Rice and Timberland, and a white bull’s color on the corner.
Elizabeth Arden’s blue eyelash and blue contour pen improved her appearance.
And we know all this because Howard created a facial chart for him.
"Diana's eyes are such an amazing color that I wanted to highlight their striking blueness," she later wrote.
But the outcome isn't very attractive for a young girl like that - she looks like an 18-year-old who's about to get 50.
His brows are too pressing and the eyes are wearing too much boring brown.
The most striking thing is here is the evil eyeliner on the inside of the eyelid in that dung Disney princess's blue tone.
A fantasy room for a fantasy bride.
No wonder Diana's looking at us a little insecure.
One of Diana's sources of anxiety was the fact that she never knew where the public person would end and start private.
It was the beginning of this process.
The person who most likely influenced Diana’s appearance was Mary Greenwell, who still plays an important role in today’s makeup world.
The makeup artist, who is now one of Chanel’s ambassadors, is still one of the icons of the makeup world.
"Diana had incredibly beautiful skin and long limbs," she recalls.
"He was just beautiful.
The men adored him.
He was sexy without trying it."
Mary met Diana for the first time in 1991, when Anna Harvey, then the head of the Vogue, asked her to make a makeup for Diana before the December photo session with Patrick Demarchelier, one of the most prized photographers in the magazine.
Sam McKnight was also part of the team.
This happened when Diana and Charles had the biggest marital problems and a fight started for public support.
"They didn't tell us who it was, although we knew it was someone very famous," said Greenwell.
"When we arrived, Diana was just standing there, warm and friendly and extremely excited that she could be on the front cover of Vogue."
This cover picture - Diana in a simple black sweater, chin laying on her hands, her blue eyes bright, nail elegant French manicure, hair cut short - was fractured.
It radiated positivity, individuality, and elegance.
Above all, it was modern, conveying the minimalist aesthetics of the early nineties, and creating a strong contrast between Diana and the royal family, who were faced with the "dose of Horrible", as the Queen later called it.
"Diana was very tense about her makeup.
He just wanted to look fresh and different," Greenwell said.
Over time, he taught Diana himself to make up - cream, makeup cream, a hide-and-seek to raise your eyes, eyelash - and stressed a healthy skin care routine, encouraging her to take good care of herself and to follow the mantra "inside beauty".
Diana "did everything moderately," says Greenwell.
He slept well enough and reduced the consumption of alcohol, which is very important for the skin with a fresh appearance.
The princess preferred Guerlain's makeup cream, Clarins' lipsticks, and Clinique's Wild Rose cheek.
But the biggest favor Mary did Diana was to alienate her from the blue eye wave.
"It just made him so much older," he said.
Instead, he used a combination of soft brown and neutral tones along with a brown penline on a pen cap that was melted together, so that all edges were beautifully soft.
Often, he used just a ton of cream and a little sunwood to highlight Diana’s healthful shine.
"Diana used to call me and invite me to discuss the products I really liked doing," Greenwell said to me.
"I think it was relaxing for him; a chance to take a few moments for yourself."
His favorite was the luxury brand Clarins.
Diana was allegedly using day and night cream for their sensitive skin and their alpine herbal cleaning milk and toner.
He also attended the beauty salon of the cosmetic Janet Filderman in Central London regularly in facial care.
Diana was a famously beautiful skin, but sometimes she had rosacea, a moderate cheek rash that is often caused by stress.
To alleviate this, he used natural soothing oils, including castor oil.
"Diana had a wonderful bone structure," said Greenwell.
The only part of his appearance he wasn't very confident of was his nose.
Anna Harvey recalls: "One time when the newspapers wrote that she had been in a beauty surgery, she turned to me and said, "I honestly, if I had let my nose operate, do you think I would have chosen one?"
As Mary Greenwell and Sam McKnight began to take advice, Diana felt more confident about her new appearance.
One of his most memorable public appearances - in 1994 at the Serpentine Gallery, London, where he wore a famous "premises dress", a provocative, bare shoulder figure from Christina Stambolian - shows that the signature style of his life began to develop.
With short hair and hair over the ears, Diana is both sexy and dynamic, her short hair in sharp contrast with a very challenging black silk dress.
His makeup is perfect - attractive, yet modest, with a black eyeliner stressing the blueness of his eyes.
Without fear of bright colors, especially red, he was wearing a shiny red nail polish, probably Revlon Red, which then became a trade mark in a sense.
A few months later, he flashed his elegant red manicure during the miscarriage of a child’s fund in the Royal College of Sisters.
The princess was the standard of health and self-assurance.
And finally, he had full control.
Dayd and in the form, his makeup is flawless, he will convey exactly what he wants the viewers to think: here is a woman who finally seems to have a sense of herself and a purpose in life and who has finally found her place after having just 36.
It's a shame he couldn't prove it to himself.
Southwest Japan is preparing for the arrival of the typhuun Noru
A large part of south-west Japan, including the regions affected by rainfalls last month, was preparing for even more rain on Friday than the typhun Noru, which was one of the world's strongest storms, moved ever closer to the main islands of the country.
According to the Meteorology Department, the Amam archipelago located a little south of the island of Kyushu and some 1,350 km south of Tokyo are hit by strong winds and plenty of rainfall on Friday’s lunch, and in the next 48 hours it is possible that rains will rain down up to 800 mm.
The representative of the Meteorological Department said that Noru, which represents a certain type of deer in Korean, is likely to turn north and rain over Kyushu, although the northern parts of the island, hit by the rainfalls and floods that killed 36 people and left four missing, are likely to escape the worst.
"This is an extremely slow-moving storm," he added, pointing out, therefore, that there is a greater risk of flooding, as there is a high rainfall in one region over a long period of time.
The Noru, which at one point was a Category 5 typhuon and is an unusually long-life storm, first formed two weeks ago and wandered round the north of the Pacific before heading for the Northwest, targeting Japan and weakening its approach.
The representative added that, depending on the change in the course, Noru can move directly across Kyushu and then along the island of Honshu in Japan, but it is still difficult to identify the long-term journey.
There are places in the landscape where, if necessary, conventional vehicles can't get away with the best of intentions.
There's an ATV.
The ATVs used in the military field gave an overview of the Defence Home!
There is nothing new about the use of such light-weight and high-performance vehicles in military structures.
The need for them emerged already during World War II, but more attention was paid to them a decade later.
Simplicity and strength
As early as 1956, the M-274, known as the mechanical mule, rolled out of Willys Overland’s factories — further development of a vehicle designed to evacuate the wounded during the late years of World War II.
It's a little strange to call mechanical mule the truth.
It's hard to imagine a more agile vehicle.
Wheeled platform, seat and steering wheel: all, luxury.
It was as if the super-garras constructors had hit the drawings from the engineer's desk too hard and started production in the first place.
In war, however, there is much more permeability in comfort.
There was no match to the mule tested in the Vietnam jungle in this category.
Hardly easy, a machine weighing less than five hundred kilograms, was able to cover those places where the subdued Willys Jeep, who had even his superpermeable mythological reputation, had to show the brake lights.
Most of the vehicles with a load capacity of nearly 500 kg were used in transport operations, both for the transport of moon and for the transport of propulsion.
At other times, lighter, non-returned anti-tank weapons were also installed on the back of the mule.
However, such a truck fell under fire, and it still happened, the driver was able to shift the steering system forward in the last trouble and let it be so low that it was possible to drive the vehicle lying on the stomach.
Mulases were produced up to 1970, together with 11 240 of them, and were used in the army until 1980, when they were replaced against the winning HMMWVs.
For the next two decades, ATVs in military circles had rather marginal meaning.
They came back to the picture after the two towers of dust fell in New York, and U.S. soldiers found themselves in the deserts of Iraq and Afghanistan.
That's where the knowledge and understanding of the need for something to fill the void between Humwee and the infantry.
Since ATVs generally do not offer significant protection, they are not the best option for the direct performance of battle tasks.
However, fast and light machines are suitable for special tasks.
For example, even intelligence and rescue operations.
At present, thousands of ATVs and UTVs are used in the American army.
Most of them, such as the XUV550dk purchased for the Defence Union, are essentially similar to those in civil circulation, but supplemented according to the needs of the army.
The names of the trademarks that received the falcon have been represented by names such as Mule, Hondalt Rancher and Foreman, Yamahalt Rhino and Arctic Cat and the ever-wide choice of leading military-AV manufacturers in Polaris.
In 2013, Polaris signed a five-year contract with the American Special Forces Centre (SOCOM) for the supply of two-seat MRZR2 and MRZR4 and a separate five-year contract for single-seat MV850 based on Polaris Sportsman, with both infrared and black-out lights and innovative bee-end tyres, which ensure mobility even after a 50-caliber weapon hit.
Prior to the entry into the market of MV850, Polaris was able to supply the military with vehicles MV700 and MV800.
MV700 is the military version of Polaris 700cc Twin Sportsman, accompanied by winches, a two-part fuel tank to pass larger distances, a reinforced frame and base and some other military equipment that does not allow farmers or just the same forest to get bigger.
Similarly to Polaris ATVs, the John Deere M-Gators, used successfully in Iraq and Afghanistan, are equipped with armoured, baggage-resistant hoods and some other elements that are useless in ranches, but necessary in the battle zone.
A vehicle weighing 750 kilograms can carry almost its weight, or 570 kilos of stuff.
The engine’s power is also sufficient to carry lighter extruders and artillery parts.
The shape to be changed in the back of the box, the sides of which are removable, allows to drive the baggage of point A, point B, which is even larger than this small but horizontal insect from its dimensions.
Later, M-Gator’s upgraded versions A1, which are 20 horsepower more powerful than the original 20 horsepower M-Gator, and the subsequent reinforced frame A2, which is even better for carrying and towing the difficulties, and A3, which combines the positive characteristics of A1 and A2.
In fact, the M-Gators were already in Bosnia in 1997 and 1998, where medical camps used them to evacuate the wounded.
At the same time, they also reduced the load of soldiers on their feet, carrying things that would otherwise have to be carried on the back of the head.
If most of the ATVs in use in power structures are modifications to civil vehicles, there are also some exceptions.
The most outstanding of these are war horses bearing the name of Prowler in Phoenix International, which have been successfully used in all battle, intelligence and rescue missions worldwide.
According to the manufacturer, these vehicles, which were first introduced ten years ago and were designed to carry out special operations, have been overcome by bottlenecks that are characteristic of conventional ATVs and those that are needed to be modified by the army, both in terms of conductivity, resilience and safety.
Being externally and externally similar to ordinary ATV, Prowler is, however, totally different in terms of both its design and its capacity.
He is faster, more resistant, more stable and able to transport and carry greater difficulties than other similar vehicles.
For example, if, in the case of normal ATV, the driver has to play with his body position continuously and use both hands for manoeuvring, acceleration and braking to maintain the vehicle’s balance, the driving of Prowler is more like driving the car.
However, it does not matter whether Prowler, Gator, MV850, or some other concept or UTV, each of them has a similar field of use.
And it is clear that, in circumstances where defence costs are widely reduced and where, instead of a large conventional war, small - sized, targeted sushi are practiced, light -weight and fast vehicles are joined by the army in order to remain in service.
As a result of the department's plethora, sensitive data on vulnerable children under care were published
As a result of a worrying infringement of the information, the mother of one child was wrongly provided with the personal data of the dependent children, including information on whether they are sexually active.
A table was sent to the mother by e-mail containing the names, dates of birth, locations and specific concerns and points of attention of all children under the care of a large service provider in Victoria.
The e-mail revealed every child's residence.
The list states that a 13-year-old boy is released from bail and shows sexual behavior, that a 15-year-old girl who has problems with self injury, abuse and running away from certain substances is "out with a boyfriend" and "not coming back tonight", and that a 14-year-old boy needs help with "caring for himself" and is verbally aggressive and physically threatening.
The table appears to be a transfer document intended to be sent to the night shift supervisor.
The document contains notes as to when there will be a child waiting for his or her home or whether they may contact the staff to follow him or her.
A worrying number of details have been provided for some children.
As regards a 15-year-old boy, it has been written with caution: "If staff contact to obtain permission to search the room and/or review the laptop/USB device due to the suspicion of inappropriate sexual material, this shall be authorised."
The document also announces that a 17-year-old girl who receives only three months' time and is released from the care facility is so at risk of suicide that the staff must call the emergency services immediately upon her escape.
As for a 16-year-old paroled boy, it was noted that he was out and "to contact the staff later to follow him".
Although only the name of the accommodation unit in which the children are kept, and not the addresses thereof, is mentioned in the lists, however, there are sufficient details to enable them to be found.
The 2015 data leak came out when Mother shared her experience with Fairfax Media in communication with the Ministry of Health and Services and Child Protection since her daughter was taken over four years ago.
He agreed to share his concerns now that his daughter had become 18 and left the system.
The heartbreaking decision to hand over her daughter to child protection was reduced after a violent incident at home. This case is one of the more and more complaints about domestic violence that parents are making against their children.
For example, within six months of leaving home, her daughter was able to get seven criminal charges, she was moved hundreds of miles away from home, and she seemed to be able to cope successfully, but then moved back without informing her parents, and she was accepted and facilitated by the guardians of her daughter in two relationships between her daughter and her older husband.
The relationship with the first of these boyfriends, 17-year-olds, with whom the nursing institutions allowed the wife to regularly stay in a local hotel at the time of the 15-year-old, ended when a young man was charged with having sexual intercourse with the child a few days after he was 18 years old.
"Why did she leave the system in a worse situation than when she entered it?" asks her mother.
"And does this happen to all the children under care?"
It is in favour of setting up an institution that would allow the Ministry of Health and Services to monitor children during the first few weeks after they have been taken into their care before they are moved to their homes.
This would allow them to better understand how children communicate with others and what the risks and their needs are, especially educationally.
The state government is looking for new ways to reduce the need for children to be placed in home care, including by seeking to better support their parents.
Targeted aid packages, financed by $62 million over four years, are designed to help move children from home to better-organised situations.
In addition, a two - year experiment of 5,6 million dollars, published last October, will allow professional carers to be offered to at least 28 children to help them get out of their care or to avoid getting into it.
According to the department’s representative, the information leak was not officially reported when it happened, although the mother claims that she informed two department staff within a few months of the incident.
The department is now working with the service provider to analyse the case.
"Every alleged leak of private data is taken very seriously, and we are working to ensure that it has not had a negative impact on the young people concerned."
Last July, Jenny Mikakos, Minister of Families and Children, commissioned an independent review of the sample of child protection privacy incidents during the five-year period.
As a result, the Department agreed to the seven recommendations made and has updated the Child Protection Guide to ensure that staff clearly understood their roles and privacy-related activities, changed IT systems to prohibit the automatic aggregation of certain personal data, and formally reviewed the function of the Department's privacy.

On Thursday, the Government of Australia brought charges against the State’s largest mortgage to the Borrower Commonwealth Bank for large-scale violations of the rules on money laundering and terrorist financing.
The Financial Intelligence Agency AUSTRAC disclosed that they have initiated civil punishment proceedings against Commbank in the Federal Court for "serious and systematic non-conformity" in the largest case in Australia and in the first case where a large bank is accused.
"CommBank's conduct in this matter has left Australian society unprotected against serious and lasting financial crime," said AUSTRAC in the court document.
In his statement, the Commonwealth Bank said that they would investigate the charges closely and say, "When the time is right".
The largest mortgage lender in Australia did not report "at the right time or at all" suspicious circumstances concerning transactions of more than USD 77 million (US$ 61 million) in total," reported AUSTRAC.
According to the Agency, the Bank has committed an infringement of 53 700 anti-money laundering and terrorist financing acts, in particular in relation to so-called ‘smart input machines’.
The previous largest case of this type was previously linked to Tabcorp Holdings, the most popular betting intermediary in Australia, who had only 108 alleged infringements.
Tabcorp was fined $45 million and is the largest civilian punishment in Australian corporate history.
AUSTRAC’s representative refused to comment on the possible punishment of Commbank or whether the Agency’s line of origin may have other banks.
The maximum penalty for non-compliance with the law against money laundering and terrorist financing is USD 18 million per infringement.
Intelligent cash-in machines are a specific type of ATMs that accept both cash and check-in payments and facilitate anonymous cash deposits.
According to AUSTRAC, the use of smart input machines by Commbank has increased significantly since their introduction in May 2012.
Cash contributions amounted to USD 5.8 billion in the six months preceding June 2016 compared to USD 89 million in the first six months following the introduction of the Commbank ATMs.
AUSTRAC argues in the case-law that cash contributions were made under fake names, so that the proceeds were received on syndicates importing drugs.
"Even after Commbank's attention was drawn to suspected money laundering or "smurfing" in Commbank's accounts, Commbank did not start to monitor its customers to make money laundering and terrorist financing difficult," the court documents show.
AUSTRAC added that CommBank's accounts were also used as a "coupling", a form of money laundering involving transfers between countries, without the money actually having to cross international borders.
Nordea and DNB combined bank will become reality at the end of the year
The merger of DNB and Nordea Baltic entities into Luminor will only take place in the last quarter of this year, says Business Day.
The opening of doors in the common legal body has been delayed.
Following the publication of the merger plans last summer, banks indicated that the completion of the transaction could remain in the second quarter.
In April, however, the DNB's communications manager said that it would be postponed to the third quarter.
In particular, the Swedish Financial Inspectorate gave further instructions to Luminor to comply with the regional importance of the joint bank.
Trump called New Hampshire it "narcourka", making the state politicians angry.
"The President is wrong," said New Hampshire Republican Governor Chris Sununu.
It is disappointing that his misdescription of the epidemic ignores everything the state has to offer.
Senator Maggie Hassan, a New Hampshire i Democrat, called the comments "rejective" and said on Twitter that his state is no different from any other that fights widespread opioid abuse.
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, as well as a Democrat, agreed.
"It's totally unacceptable for the president to talk about NH this way," he wrote on Twitter.
This is a completely wrong picture of NH and the epidemic.
Opioid dependence - the category of drugs that includes heroin and fentanyl - is the most deadly drug epidemic in American history.
In 2016, the overdose of drugs killed more people than weapons or car accidents - based on the data analysed by The New York Times, it is estimated that 59 000 people - and is now the main cause of death for Americans under the age of 50.
In 2015, more than 97 million people in the United States consumed prescription painkillers, according to the Agency for the Abuse of Substances and Mental Health.
It is estimated that 12 million of these people did so in a way that was not determined by a doctor.
New Hampshire has been hit hard and its residents repeatedly raised the problem during the 2016 campaign to presidential candidates.
New Hampshire was also estimated to have 470 overdose-related deaths in 2016 compared to 439 cases in 2015.
In 2012, they were New Hampshire i according to statistics of the Ministry of Health and Service of 163.
On Thursday Sununu described the opioid epidemic as "one of the worst health crises the state has ever faced".
He said that the government has doubled the resources devoted to prevention, treatment and recovery.
According to him, the state has also spent millions of dollars on child prevention programmes, legal protection to end drug trafficking and initiatives aimed at making the naloxone used in the treatment of overdose more accessible.
A call to find drivers in connection with the rape of two girls in Witton
The police are trying to find two drivers in connection with the investigation of the rape of a 14-year-old girl.
A teenager was attacked in the Witton area in Birmingham on 26 July at about 02:00 (BST).
Before that attack, he was raped at Witton Station.
One man has been charged with the first case.
The British Transport Police want to speak to two drivers as part of the investigation.
According to the police, the first car is a light-colored shaman.
Detective Chief Inspector Tony Fitzpatrick said: "We have reason to believe that the driver of this vehicle spoke to the victim at the station before the other person picked him up and then raped him in the car.
We would like to know what was said during this conversation. In addition, the manager may know important details that would help us to investigate."
According to the police, the driver of the second vehicle, described as the red VW sharan, probably took the victim home after being raped for the second time.

Take time to enjoy each other’s company in some charming, romantic place.
When you talk about an exciting subject, you're going to burn, you're going to make big plans, maybe you're going to make promises... which one minute later you're going to think of.
The other party, however, will remember your words.
Must be a bit restless. It's hard to focus on some kind of activity.
Your feeling may not depend on what is happening, but on what has happened in the past.

Why are dogs chewing grass?
Sometimes it's thought that a dog eats medicine when he's not feeling well and wants to throw up.
In fact, most dogs that eat grass are perfectly healthy.
Only less than 10 percent of dogs who eat grass do it because of a disease.
One reason why a dog may suddenly start eating grass may be a poor table for nutrients.
Those dogs with worms may also become more interested in chewing grass.
Thus, if a dog who has not chewed the grass before has suddenly become hungry by the grass and often eats it, it is worth checking with the doctor to find out, for example, if there is a possible problem with the digestive system.
It is worth mentioning that the dog may also eat grass because he likes it or is just bored.
If a health problem is excluded, it should be established that the family’s favorite activity is still sufficiently developed and entertaining.
From the west, thunder clouds are coming to Estonia.
In Northern Estonia, there have already been noises and individual flashes in many parts.
This afternoon, the weather service also issued a lightning warning.
Today, mainly in Northern Estonia, there are several parts of the thunder.
The clouds are moving rapidly westward.
"The southwest wind outbreaks range from inland to 15 m/s on islands and on the coast of 18 m/s, but the lightning can be accompanied by stronger winds," stands on the weather service website.
However, a much larger thunderstorm in south-eastern Finland and Russia on the east side of St Petersburg.
Fortunately, however, the winds in Estonia are blowing from the west and from the southwest, so there is no risk at least for the larger storms to turn on Estonia at first.
Sylvester Stallone will step up in the guest role in the second season of "Our Life" series
The leading producer, Dan Fogelman, announced on Thursday at the TV Critics Association press conference in the framework of a series-related forum that Sylvester Stallone will appear in the upcoming second season of NBC’s popular drama series.
As a guest, the actor takes up the role of Kevin (Justin Hartley) in the films that take place at the beginning of the season.
"Kevin plays in the big movie and we needed a big co-star," said Fogelman.
At the end of last season, Kevin was hired to play an important role in a film staged by Ron Howard.
This season, we'll see how the character is involved in the project and also warm up the relationship with his ex, who is played by Alexandra Breckenridge.
Fogelman says that Stallone plays in "the movie Kevin's in".
The star Milo Ventimiglia, who plays the series in the past pictures of Hartley's father, played as a coincidence in 2006 in the film Rocky Balboa's son Stallone.
Fogelman said that the still flowering friendship of Ventimiglia with Stallone was probably what helped the show attract a big star as a guest actor.
"We have an excellent scenario for him.
I think it's gonna be really exciting," said Fogelman.
Our life will return to the TV screens on September 26.
Two elite university employees were arrested in the United States after the national hunt.
42-year-old Northwestern Professor Wyndham Lathem turned himself in to the police in California after the police had been looking for him.
Andrew Warren, a 56-year-old employee of Oxford University, was captured by the police in San Francisco.
Men are suspected of being stabbed cruelly by 26-year-old Trenton Cornell-Duranleau.
He was found dead in Lathem's apartment in Chicago at the end of the month.
A few days later, suspects made a large donation to a library in cash under the name of the dead.
Before he was handed over to the police, Latham, a member of the Chicago police force, said that he sent a video to friends and family members about the biggest mistake of his life.
CNN didn't see the video and the police won't publish it.
According to the police, it was a brutal murder, and his body was transformed because of the wounds.
Warren had recently arrived in Chicago from Britain, but the investigators have not yet determined whether or not he was familiar with the victim.
Before the arrest, both suspects fled the state.
Elise Christie is talking about how she got over Sochi's horrors and cyber-bullying to skate again in the name of gold.
Compared to this fragile young woman who recently considered saying goodbye to the Uusitadium forever, the age of 26 has changed to Christie's unknown.
Evil insults struck him down, especially because he was also a pain in the ass when he was a kid at West Lothian school.
At the moment, he is packing up his confidence and believes that the trial can go back to the beginning of the cycle, bringing with him at least one gold in Pyeongchang.
"I would undoubtedly like to come out as an Olympic winner," he says, without fear, of specifying the purpose.
"I feel like I'm both physically and spiritually at the right point to do it."
At one point, he had a dream of a career as an ice skater, until aesthetic elements began to diminish his interest.
"I was a very good jumper, but I had trouble with the party seeking artisticism," he said laughing.
"I wasn't very good at elegance, decentness.
It was a reasonable choice, because short-circuiting is best suited to my personality."
A woman walks around the world: my daily budget is $5!
To give the truth, I have also had such experience, true for 40 days, where I decided to live the life of "a multitude" in southern France, just to be free and live the day at a time.
She spent the night in a tent, in the woods, in small town stations, etc.
The second week I joined a French "homeless", 44-year-old man.
Oh, don't think about some fags or something: We just stayed in the same park in Mentones and became friends, although he was 15 years older than me, he was a good socialist.
Turns out he's from a good family, Paris, ex-French Navy officer.
You don't drink, you don't do, you don't do, you know, you're a decent person, you're intelligent, you're a nice communicator, you've seen life.
In a word, I joined him, and the next three weeks we wandered together, from town to town, and also about 5€ a day for food money.
The money still came, so much for you to live.
The man taught how to provide help in the terraces and on the roads of closed hotels and restaurants in the evenings.
We did just as much work as we could for the next 2-3 days, and then...
At some point, I got a fever and decided I couldn't take it anymore.
I took a flight to Helsinki, from there to home.
And by the way, I still regret it.
These 40 days must have been the best in my life.
In Indonesia, a man who stole three amps from the mosque was burned alive, the Hungarian news agency MTI.
The 30-year-old thief sneaked out of the mosque of the city of Bekas near Jakarta on August 1st, but the pilgrim noticed him and shouted, "Take the thief!"
They came to help, and they immediately started tracking the thief.
He escaped on a motorcycle and even swam across the river.
The chase lasted a few miles, then one of the stone cast by the pursuers hit the back of the head, causing serious injury.
An angry chaser caught the thief and beat him up.
A chaser poured a thief with petrol and set him on fire.
The innocent died of burn wounds at the scene.
The body was transferred to the East Jakarta Police Hospital.
The police took possession of both the dead motorcycle and the stolen amps.
At first, reports appeared in the local press, as if it were not a thief, but rather an electric converter, who claimed to want to repair the amps.
The police, however, firmly ignored these claims.
The estates of the deceased reported that they did not make a statement about what happened.
According to the German news agency dpa, this step is due to the fact that Indonesians do not trust the police or judicial authorities much.
Indonesia is the largest Islamic country in the world.
Of the 255 million inhabitants, up to 87.2% are Muslims.
Australian kitchen: from fingering to school garden.
From the indigenous aboriginals, today’s Australian cuisine has inherited fingertips and kangaroo meat.
British roots have also had a great impact on the table - for example, the Vegems, dark brown, salty beers' butter, which is stained with butter on the bread or on the Greek, reminds of the British Marmite.
Meat pies, i.e. meat pies, which are served with boiled potatoes and sauce, also come from the British.
The British are also BBQ Snags, or raw sausages, which are cooked by Australians on the grill, while the British are more in the oven.
One local sweetstar is Pavlova’s beseetor, although it is also called their invention by New Zealanders.
Sweets are also loved with coconut and oatmeal crisps Anzac cookies and coconuts with chocolate coatings.
Honey Joys, that's what they call honey-maize balls.
Australian cooking celebrity Stephanie Alexander and her life's work, the home cook kitchen Bible "Cooker's Companion", which is at least half a million Australian homes. / Blake Storey, Prime Creative Media
This autumn Stephanie is celebrating her 77th birthday.
His father was a civil servant, and his mother Mary loved food very much.
Stephanie studied the library at the university, and, as Australian youths could possibly do, she went to Europe after her studies.
In France, Stephanie’s food love was just a property and developed.
In London, however, he met his first wife, Monty, who, when they returned to Australia, opened a simple dining place in Melbourne in 1964, in The Jamaican House.
Ten years later, marriage collapsed, and the restaurant closed the doors.
In 1976, he opened a restaurant for a more prosperous people, Stephanie's Restaurant, which was one of Melbourne's most prized restaurants for the next 21 years.
We are still talking about a restaurant of importance for brands as the first fine dining place in Melbourne, which really was able to value fresh raw materials and served seasonal food - a fact that now seems to be an abbott, but at the end of the last century it was not yet.
Since his withdrawal from the restaurant in 1997, Stephanie has focused on writing cook books, they have appeared from his feathers 15 years ago.
There are even more productive food writers in Estonia, but in his case, no book was simply a recipe collection.
For Australian chefs, different Stephanie Alexander’s cook books have been indispensable.
However, the lady has a fifth cookbook, The Cook's Companion, for her life's work, which is now at least half a million Australian homes.
The book was first published in 1996, supplemented in 2004 and the latest version in 2014.
It is in my bookcase that the 2004 release takes quite a lot of space, because there are about a thousand recipes on 1126 pages in an impromptu book!
The latest option, however, is even more extensive.

This is a true cooking Bible, where, in addition to recipes, the purchase and storage of different raw materials are discussed, cooking technologies are presented and recommendations are made for the purchase of kitchen supplies.
Foods are in alphabetical order, and there are many cross-references in the work - obviously the library education did not run down the side of the cooker.
Stephanie herself points out that it was this book that changed her life and gave her a new direction to future activities.
The popularity of the book makes it feel like he has something to give people, led to the next big, kitchen garden project, which, under our circumstances, is comparable to school gardens.
The fourth person in Estonia got a heart in Finland.
According to doctors, cardio surgeon Günter Tali and cardiologist Pentti Põdra, who participated in the surgery together with Finnish medics, the postoperative period has been expected.
"It's very hard to say how long a patient could have lived without a new heart," Põder said.
According to doctors, the world has now lived with a heart pump for a maximum of eight years.
The man himself is not ready to talk about it.
He was first diagnosed with heart failure two years ago, and the disease had already reached its final stage, and heart failure was caused by ischaemic disease.
"For this patient, transplantation was the only option," Tal added.
Cardiosurgeon says that after the transplant, the patient will no longer have the batteries or cord accompanying the heart pump.
All he's got is a scar and a drug that suppresses immunity.
The patient can do sports and generally live on as a normal person," he said.
The first year is the most dangerous.
Põder added that it will take three to six months for complete recovery.
According to both physicians, the patient should be closely monitored for medication on a regular basis; however, the medicines also have side effects.
In addition, the patient should check to avoid organ rejection.
The most dangerous is the first year, but according to ISHLT, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, more than 50 per cent of patients live for more than 10 years.
He stated that the results were better in Helsinki and that the longest lived with a transplanted heart for 25 years.
Cardiosurgeon explained that since the patient had poor blood circulation due to the disease, he was given a heart pump a year ago that helped to recover from surgery.
When a man’s pulmonary artery pressure dropped, he became a suitable candidate for transplantation.
The transplant operation is not considered to be a very difficult operation, according to Tal: the right timing is very important.
"It took a lot more time to get the pump and then get the heart when you put a new heart in," he said.
In addition, a cardiosurgeon brought out extra-body blood flow as a complex part of the surgery.
Rather, he said that heart transplanting is rare, as it is the least needed by Estonians.
Renal, hepatic and lung transplants are more frequent.
I mean, a rare operation still involves excitement, but we've been practicing this job for many years.
Learning about yourself and your nervous system is one of the art of this profession," Tal added.
The body needs four more people.
According to Tali, the patient was given a heart because none of the other patients living in Scandiatranspland’s country were eligible for the body.
Scandia transplant is an organ exchange organisation composed of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Estonia.
There are currently four other people in Estonia on the heart transplant list.
"They are still numbered patients," emphasised Põder.
According to Tali, big men with a 0-positive blood group are waiting for the heart.
"In Finland, there is a line for it for about six months," he stated.
To get a heart, there's also a set of conditions.
"The heart of a woman is usually not suitable for a man, the heart of a great man for a small and so on", listed the cardiosurgeon.
How to finance company vehicles?
In a changing consumption society, the financing opportunities for companies' vehicles have been expanded - more and more companies are also using full-service leasing or more non-compulsory long-term car rental.
The leasing and leasing of a vehicle are two clearly different financial transactions, which involve different obligations and expectations, but which often cause confusion.
According to Villi Translation, Estonian sales and marketing manager of the international car rental company AVIS Estonia, companies are increasingly moving towards full-service leasing and are increasingly being used for long-term rental.
The translation highlighted the main questions for which it is possible to choose a suitable way of using the vehicle when looking for answers.
How long to use the vehicle?
The biggest difference between car rental and leasing is the time of use.
"It is worth giving preference to the addition for longer-term use of a vehicle if the company plans to use commercial vehicles for a longer period of time", Translation explained, adding that it is worth deciding in favour of the normal addition to have a vehicle, full-service lease or long-term rental if the vehicle is to be used as a service, i.e. daily use of the car, but leaving the maintenance obligations to the service provider and so-called abandoning the property.
"The car has a much shorter operating period than the leasing period, but many larger car rental companies also offer long-term car rentals, where car rental takes place without complex contracts and free return", Translation introduced various car rental options.
Who will be the owner of the vehicle?
At the end of the regular lease, the tenant will become the owner of the car.
"In the case of full-service leasing, it is possible to continue with leasing payments under the same or better conditions at the end of the leasing period, replacing a new vehicle that is equivalent to the needs of the company", he said, stressing that, as the consumer society is increasingly moving towards a service-oriented consumption, the ownership of the vehicle is an additional obligation for the company.
In addition, full-service leasing offers the possibility to buy a car on the basis of a wish and agreed terms.
However, the possibility of renting is not available and is paid only for the period of use.
The rental of a car is usually carried out in the offices of the car companies and the rental of a car from the rental agency of the rental companies.
Although car companies’ representations are primarily involved in the sale of vehicles, they also offer the possibility of leasing and, in some cases, car rental.
The rental companies, however, have the sole purpose of renting cars.
The translation said that the reasons for the use of the rental service are different - many companies rent professional vehicles, in addition, it is convenient to use the service when on duty or on leave, or when their own car is repaired.
"In the case of official vehicles, there is an increasing shift to full-service leasing, which provides the customer with transparency of costs, time savings in the purchase, use and return process of vehicles and greater comfort", the sales and marketing manager introduced a growing leasing trend.
Every year, more and more companies use a full-service lease in their car park, thus optimising their costs and focusing on their main business.
What is the coverage of service-based insurance?
In the case of a leased car, if there is a mandatory insurance policy, then the rental car is mostly covered by basic insurance, and it is also necessary to decide whether to include, for example, accident insurance, theft insurance or full-time insurance. "If you compare the normal lease with a full-time lease, the customer will receive more at an equivalent monthly payment, as in addition to the vehicle and insurance, the monthly payment will also be covered by regular car maintenance, 24-hour assistance, tyre change and other agreed services," explained the Translation.
"If any new vehicle can be included in the standard lease, the service provider will help to select a vehicle corresponding to the wishes and needs of the company, which also takes into account the operation functions", he compared it with stressing that the full lease will certainly help to optimise the costs associated with the company's car parks.
"The choice of motor vehicles, however, depends on the car park of the service provider: different rental companies offer both small and economic vehicles for urban use in their car parks and luxury ones for business meetings," said Translation.
Of course, during a tight rental period, the desired car has already been rented, but early booking of the desired vehicle will help.
When choosing between leasing or leasing, it should first be made clear how long it is to want to use the vehicle and what long-term plans are in relation to the car.
It is certainly worth taking a careful look at the different conditions and obligations for services.
At the press conference yesterday, Olga Ivanova, a member of the Riigikogu that joined Edgar Savisaari's electoral union, said that the Savisaare electoral association would offer the Central Party a whole competition in Tallinn during the autumn elections.
How likely, however, is Edgar Savisaar's cooperation with Urmas Sõrumaa Electoral Union "Tugus Tallinn"?
The U.S. Navy veteran was ordered to remove the American flag from the mailbox in an envelope.
The difference between a U.S. veteran and a Florida homeowner's union is at the heart of a rolling dispute.
Erus U.S. Navy officer John Ackert says that he received a letter from Tallahassee Southwood's House Community last week asking him to remove or face punishment in a envelope representing the State flag from the mailbox.
He told WCTV he wasn't going to give up without a fight and he's filed an appeal.
"I deal with it honestly as a bully," said Ackert.
And I think people should fight any form of bullying, especially that.
Ackert said that the association of home owners claimed that its mailbox was not in line with Southwood's aesthetic values.
U.S. Navy veteran John Ackert said he was ordered to remove the American flag in a envelope covering his mailbox.
"Because of the approach to the end of the holiday season, we ask you to remove the envelope of the American flag from the mailbox," forwarded the letter.
The decorations may be out 30 days before and must be removed within 15 days at the latest.
He said the envelope's been out for four years.
It was placed there 30 days after moving into the house.
Messages to the Southwood Housing Association did not receive an immediate response on Thursday morning.
Some Ackert neighbours told WCTV that the letter was a bit harsh, and they were not particularly surprised by the activities of the Homeowners' Union.
"They do these things all the time," said Mike Stephenson.
I think it's ridiculous.
Why can't you be patriotic in your country?
Mike Patel said, "This is a veteran who served our country.
It's just a mailbox with a flag.
I don't think that's right.
The house belongs to him, at least you can afford it.
The letter from the association of home owners states that Ackert has 15 days to remove the envelope, otherwise he will be fined.
He has not received an answer to his appeal.
Vietnam "repents regret" for the German kidnapping charge
Vietnam stated on Thursday that it regrets the comments of the German Foreign Ministry that accused Vietnam's intelligence service of being kidnapped by a former Vietnamese oil company, which is wanted in the country due to ownership charges.
The German authorities believe that Trinh Xuan Thanh was involved in Berlin, which left Vietnam's intelligence stations on Wednesday for 48 hours to leave the country.
▪ faces the charges of ingestion, with the death penalty in case of conviction.
He was looking for azyl in Germany, but his statement had not yet been processed when the Vietnamese authorities called for his release.
Le Thi Thu Hang, a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Vietnam, told reporters that these comments were "extremely regrettable" and Thanh turned himself in to the police in Vietnam on 31 July.
"Vietnam always considers it important and wants to develop strategic relations with Germany," he said without going into the details.
Thanh, 51, disappeared in July last year after being originally charged with unfair management of the subsidiary company PetroVietnam, a national oil and gas gig, which resulted in losses of around USD 150 million.
The Vietnamese police issued an arrest warrant in September.
In March, a police investigation was initiated to investigate the ownership of its alleged participation in the real estate development project.
Thanh was the chairman of PetroVietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation until 2013, when he was appointed to several senior positions in the government, including the vice-chairman of Hau Giangi Province in the southern Mekong Delta.
He was elected to the National Assembly in May 2016, but was released from the legislative body pre-supposed by the Communists in the month following its first session.
He was also expelled from the Communist Party.
The Vietnamese Ambassador in Germany was invited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday and informed that Germany would require Thanh to be returned in order to carry out its procedures properly.
The bus driver saved eight puppies from the driveway, not knowing that the dogs actually have the owner.
"Where I put these eight puppies, a woman would have thrown me out of the apartment with the dogs," said Oleg, the bus driver, who saved the dogs who had no watch on the road, and handed them over to the asylum worker.
Soon, however, the owner of the dogs in the shelter showed up, for whom it became unclear why the puppies were taken away from his home.
The bus driver in Harjumaa Oleg said that he had worked as a bus driver since the early 1990s, but such a case has never taken place in his career before."I took the number 146 on my usual route.
Near the Harju-Rist, I noticed there was something small running along the road.
I thought it was a wuss, but it turns out it was four puppies," said the bus driver.
At the time, his heart got sore, and he stopped the passengers on a bus full of passengers to pick up the puppies.
"It was bad, cars would have run over them, and the dogs would have been crushed," said Oleg.
He added that the passengers were reasonable, and they also enjoyed the joy of soft dogs.
The puppies were a little scared at first, but then they got fun.
The puppies on board, the bus driver took a new tour because the schedule needed to be followed.
Once again, he saw four other little dogs there.
This was a matter of German sheepdogs.
They were so good and immediately saw that they had been taken care of.
The dogs were beautiful, they were amazing.
The first thought was, of course, that someone wanted to get rid of them for some reason," said the bus driver, that for this reason he decided to carry the puppies.
"I also picked up those four puppies and called the police," Oleg reminded me.
The organizers contacted the shelter of Tallinn animals, whose workers came to the pups after the Baltic station.
But wasn't the bus driver tempted to take the furballs?
That's the idea.
A dog boy was so beautiful and so calm.
He sat nicely like an adult dog," Oleg said.
But where do I put these eight puppies?
A woman would have thrown me out of the apartment with the dogs.
We still have a little kid.
It's early for the dog," he added.
Eve Tobias, the head of Tallinn’s shelter, confirmed that 8 German sheepdogs, two and a half months old, were actually brought to the shelter.
But the same day the owner came for the puppy family.
"We didn't even shape those puppies in and we just gave them back," he said.
"The dog owner wasn't very upset, but he said they had the only house in sight and the bus driver could have come to ask if the puppies belonged to them," said Tobias.
However, the head of the shelter added that it is good that the bus driver picked up the youngsters on the road and did not have an accident with them.
In fact, it was really good for the bus driver to react!
The Jordanian Court enforced a life sentence for the killing of three U.S. military officers
The Jordan military appeal court last year sentenced the Jordanian soldier to life sentence for the shooting of three United States military trainers.
Last month, senior Sergeant Marik al-Tuwayhale assigned a life sentence for killing Americans at the entrance to the South-Jordan air base with hard work.
Al-Tuwayha opened fire on the American caravan, claiming he was afraid of attacking the base.
After the decision, however, the video of the security camera showed that he continued to shoot even when two Americans were shadowing and waving their hands to stop shooting.
On Thursday, Hala Akhbar, who is involved in the Jordanian army, announced that a military court of appeal with five judges confirmed the sentence of al-Tuwayha.
James Harrison spends around $300,000 a year to keep his body in play.
Every NFL player depends on his body to make a living.
Therefore, many other athletes also invest a lot of money in the care and restoration of the body to stay in peak shape.
Jeremy Fowler from ESPN.com examined how far some veterans are ready to go to extend their careers.
However, no case is as extreme as the 39-year-old James Harrison, the player of the rear line of Pittsburgh Steelers, preparing for the 14th season.
According to Fowler, Harrison spends 300 000 dollars a year on needle therapy, massage therapy, chiropractors, and cups.
Most of the costs are related to travel across the country to meet specialists.
"I don't have to account for such things," said Harrison.
"If you compare the amounts earned with my expenses, payments are worth it, considering how I feel."
Mike Mitchell, Harrison's training partner and teammate at Stelers, estimated $200,000 a year to take care of his body.
30-year-old Mitchell has tested body relaxation described by Fowler as "55 kilos of metal as a massage roll".
"They roll it on you instead of rolling it on you," Mitchell said.
"If you have a tight spot on your leg and they start moving this thing around, it hurts sometimes.
But when you get up, the voltage's gone.
It just beats the tension out."
They're ready to make an additional effort, but former NFL players, Barry Cofield and Ryan Harris, spend an average of $50,000 a year on recovery.
Cofield, who played 10 seasons in the New York Giants and Washington Redskins lines, has regretted that he didn't spend any more.
"If I could go back, I'd invest even more," said Cofield Fowler.
"I'd probably use at least twice as much.
I was in good health for the first eight years of my career.
More procedures might have been helpful towards the end."
Ryan Shazier, a 24-year-old defense line player, expressed his willingness to follow his veteran teammates.
"If you pay $100,000 and make another $3 million playing, this decision is quite simple," said Shazier.
As far as long-term careers are concerned, investing in the recovery of players is much smarter than spending money on cars and villas.
An average NFL player is lucky if he can play longer than 30 years of age, the more the Harrison successes should convince his colleagues to direct their expenses to another place.
But maybe they can just find some local specialists.
Weekend Festival Baltic boss Gunnar Message tells the evening paper that the festival was received years ago from Finland and its owners visited the beach strip under Riga to expand, while the festival was stopped in Pärnu on its way back, and so it was sold to Estonia.
Gunnar says that they have targeted 25 000 visitors a day, but the chicks are only counted when the festival is over.
Preparation for this party began last September.
"We had information from the city that construction was beginning in the last place, and that's where the hotel is coming," says Gunnar, telling us about the change they had to face this year.
Now you can't see any of that stuff in there, but you'll think that if the knock didn't go down this year, it's gonna go down next.
So maybe we should have moved out of there sometime," he explains why the festival area has moved this year.
They've been running the festival for a year.
People work on the Weekly between a thousand and a half thousand - policemen, command team, volunteers, traders, security team and so on.
According to Message, the most difficult thing was to get the duet The Chainsmokers to perform for the Weekly.
After all, men are now the undisputed number of pop music worlds.
Why The Chainsmokers was hard to get to the Weekly and how Gunnar commented that two artists cancelled their performances, see already in the video.
In reply to Ansip, the bike: we have done a lot for Estonia's success.
Andrus Ansip, Vice-President of the European Commission, said that he was sad to look at Estonia's everyday policy, because the government of Jüri Ratas has turned the head of a simple and predictable tax system.
You took the opportunity of asking me what I have done for Estonia's success and what I can be proud of.
I am pleased that we have been a good team in the government and have made many important decisions over the past few months, many of which have been expected in Estonia for more than ten years," wrote Ratas today in social media.
According to the ratas, these decisions include a tax reform to increase people's incomes, a pension reform to ensure a decent retirement age for the elderly, a municipal reform to balance Estonia's development, an increase in agricultural subsidies for rural recovery and, of course, a health reform to provide available and high-quality medical care.
"I wish you a good holiday!" wrote the bike turning to Ansip.
Talents on Pärnu Weekly: drunk man climbed into a foreign car to sleep
Last night at 3:00 p.m., the police got a little bit of a challenge.
One of the Audi's owners reported that in a tank near Port Artur, a strange man climbed into his car and fell asleep.
The patrol that reacted to the event found a man who was alarmed when the guards arrived.
In fact, he was tired on his journey for a while and found a place in the back of a strange man’s car.
"The man returned on his way home after the wake of the law enforcement," describes the Western prefecture on Facebook.
It's the end of it, it's all the way!
There is no need to look for a good outdoor cinema from a distance - until 7-12 August it will last in the centre of Tartu, right on the Town Hall Square, the film festival tARTUFF.
It's a special focus on love movies.
The program also includes films that represent the darker side of love, seeing both new linens and old classics.
Numerous events in many places make the campus a film town for a week.
All the films are free of charge for visitors, up to 1500 seats, and this year there is an area covered directly in front of the screen, which temporarily creates the atmosphere of the park on the city's central square.
Eight thousand visitors can enjoy the film at the same time in the largest outdoor cinema in Europe in Switzerland.
The heart of the Locarno Film Festival will be the middle square Piazza Grande, or the Great Square, between 2 and 12 August.
Many premieres will take place during the festival and will be launched by recognised directors and participants.
At the arrival of the evening call, a ticket of 15-20 euros has to be redeemed to enjoy a single film.
Pula Film Festival in Rome-time amphitheater, Croatia
Gladiators, blood, screaming crowd, the mud arena - such a picture was opened 2000 years ago in the Pula amphitheater in Croatia, where now the July summer night enjoys films from international audiences.
For the first time, the outdoor screen was set up in the Roman-era building in 1953, making Pula one of the oldest cinemas in Europe.
Under the festivities are enjoyed by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, John Malkovich and Ben Kingsley.
The price is symbolic: the evening in the Mediterranean with high-quality films means about EUR three.
Secret Montjuïc Open Air Cinema, Spain
Next to the film, Sala Montjuïc's open-air cinema offers a wonderful view.
It operates above Barcelona on Mount Montjuïc, or the Jews.
In the dark of the evening in southern Europe, the wall of the fortress on the mountain appears to be full of firestorms, which is the visibility of itself.
In July, the organisers set up a large screen with famous films from La La Land to Manhattan in 1979.
The cinema can accommodate up to 2500 people at a time, and the entrance fee is 6.50 euros.
The ticket price includes an open-air concert just before the film, which is allowed to enjoy next to your picnic basket.
Those who do not want to sit on the lawn or have forgotten their picnics can be rented for three euros.
Under the stars of cinema, Italy
A true nostalgic Italian soul can be experienced in the central square of Bologna, where the local film archives are shown on summer evenings.
By the size of the tenth church in the world, the San Petronio Basilica can accommodate 3000 5000 people to watch old films.
Mostly in the 15th century, northern Italy, with summer evening heat and good company, creates a romantic atmosphere in which every rough Nordicman melts.
From 19 June to 15 August, there is a new film in front of the audience every evening, and all this is free of charge.
Bologna Film Archive Festival under the stars.
Vienna Town Hall Place Film Festival, Austria
Vienna is a mecca in the music world and even shows it: concert recordings and music films are exclusively scheduled for the Wiener Rathausplatz Film Festival, which takes place in the Town Hall Square of Austria.
5,000 free seats are filled from June 30 to September 3 every evening as a miracle.
After the concerts of classical music stars - Placido Domingo and Vienna Philharmonic - the festival offers jazz music recordings in the morning.
The film summer in Vienna makes it special to love good food – in addition to world-class music, you can enjoy the best restaurant dishes.
Every day from 11 a.m. to midnight, there is an open food and drink area offering traditional Austrian tastes, as well as delicate Asian, Greek, Italian, Mexican and Indian cuisine.
The stupidest questions to ask the bartender.
Huffington Post deals with the questions that have come to the ears of the bartenders, which they prefer not to hear.
What kind of drink do you do best?
Some drinks do have more ingredients than others, but they require the same skills and skill.
Often bar servants interpret this question as "What is the easiest/fastest thing to do right now?", which gives them a signal that the customer has no matter what he drinks, whether it is difficult or not to do it for the bartender.
What kind of drink do you like the most?
This question is equally interpreted so that what cocktail would be the easiest way to get from a bartender right now.
It's not a job for a bar servant to say, it's up to the client to make his own decisions about the thickness of his wallet.
Rather, the bartenders would like to ask if there are any special offers at the moment.
What's the good news?
Perhaps it is a heartfelt desire to find out whether a bar distinguishes itself from other offers, but it could also be asked otherwise.
Neither can the bartender predict what the client would prefer.
Can I have a drink that won't be very sweet?
It is similar to the previous rule that the bartender is not familiar with your taste and preferences and that what is sweet for one may not be so for the others.
Yet, he is willing to listen to what flavor - desirable cocktails might contain.
Does this drink give me a headache?
A bartender is neither a medic nor a fortune teller, so he can afford it on his heart.
The cold summer has driven Estonians abroad to travel so much that package travel is not only expensive, but sold out regardless of the price.
Also, cheap air tickets and last-minute tickets should not be expected; it is wiser to think about next year's travel plans.
The man hostage the model with a plan to sell it in the dark web.
A Polish citizen took a British hostage model in Italy.
The man was planning to auction a 20-year-old woman in a dark web, or encrypted internet, and Guardian announced.
According to the police, by July 11, a woman was lured to Milan with a promise that she would get a job at a photo shoot.
Instead, he was drugged and taken to a villa near Turin.
The prisoners allegedly tried to sell a woman in the dark web for £230,000 and filed a ransom claim with her model agency.
However, on 17 July she was taken to the British consulate.
According to the police, the suspect is the Polish citizen Lukasz Herba, who lives in Britain.
According to the newspaper Corriere della Sera, a man discovered that a kidnapped woman had a small child and did not want to be sold as a sex slave.
Such attempts are binding on people.
It would be a good thing if we were to continue to think and draw conclusions.
The recommendation to spend a little more time studying the background of those who want to be friends is obvious.
More generally, however, there could be a strategy for everyone to share in social media.
At national level, however, it must be asked whether civil servants and politicians are sufficiently aware of the threats in social media.
The lifetime of the werewolves created under controlled conditions ended with summer school, but certainly not with the real devils.
Sometimes you have to go into the woods for whatever reason.
But if it's cool between the skin, it's time to make a hot cup of tea.
There are enough resources in the forest to do that.
Defense Home!
The reason we talk about tea is that coffee and real tea contain caffeine, which, to a certain extent, has a refreshing effect, but is not the best for our health.
Using plants in free nature, you always have to be ready for testing, because both recipes and flavors are different.
Some plants need not be boiled for a long time. All they need is hot water, while others need to be drawn for hours.
Of course, it must also be noted that water and plants are clean enough.
Also, much depends on the season and place of picking.
Let us now take a closer look at how to make some simple tea drinks and how they can affect us.
Pineapples
Pine cover can be calm for a year.
If it is good to drink 2 litres of water per day, this tea is good enough to meet the need for vitamin C and also to provide some extra energy.
As with all plants, it is possible to obtain useful elements from pine trees by using alternative methods, for example, by crushing the thorns - not having to cook for long, to lift up hot water and for a few hours to pull.
A half litre of water takes 0.4 litres of thorns to be boiled for 15 minutes.
The result is a drink containing approximately 25 mg vitamin C, a lot of potassium and zinc.
In addition, the drink contains about 1.5 sugar cubes, or approximately 20 kcal sugar.
Lemon and honey can always be added to improve the taste.
And when the drink gets ugly, it can be diluted with water like syrup.
It's the same way to make a cube, but the drink itself tastes a little different.
Grandpa's drink is great and helps with a lot of troubles, from rheumatism to the hive.
Raspberry helps to overcome fatigue, has a painful effect and helps to relieve both cough and fever in case of cold diseases.
Consequently, it would not be worth more than half a litre a day.
Grandpa’s drink also makes you sweat, which is why you should find a more peaceful moment to enjoy it in winter.
To make a drink in winter, take fresh raspberry stalks, use leaves, berries or berries during summertime.
For half a litre of drink, you need a small piece of right - length branches, which you need to boil until the water acquires a reddish tone.
You can also create an image of the Raspberry bars.
To do that, crush the stalks and keep them in warm water for a few hours.
Longer and more thorough treatment also makes the drink stronger.
The finished raspberry drink can also be added to the pine pomegranate.
Blackberries
Mustard is a tree that looks like a piece of black-burned wood in nature.
Most of the time, it's on the sauces, but also elsewhere.
The fungus is a very wide area of use, as a hot drink, as a fire, instead of a violin, etc.
You can wash very well with ash.
Blackberries are a kind of super-drunk that can be used to treat a large number of diseases, even cancer or relieve them, to increase tone, to reduce stress, to prolong life.
The fungus contains a number of unique compounds and many vitamins B, as well as antioxidants and some minerals and proteins.
Tea made from mushrooms can be drank daily, there is no risk of over-consumption.
To make a drink, about 3 x 3 cm fungus pieces are sufficient, which should be cooked in 2 to 3 litres of water for 5 to 15 minutes.
Today, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas visited Estonia’s fourth largest island, Vorms, where he met local leaders and residents to discuss topical topics of island life.
The tour of the island of Vorms began at the port of Sviby, where the Prime Minister Ratas was welcomed by the municipality of Vorms, Tanel Viks, and Ivo Sarapuu, chairman of the rural council.
The first visit was to the historic St. Olavi Church and the adjacent cemetery, which is unique in Estonia for its hard stone and sandstone ring Christians.
The meeting followed with Vormsi Kindergarten-Põhikoulu, where Director Age Hälvin spoke with the Prime Minister about the state of life of the school and the organisation of studies according to which part of the school students are in distance learning.
In the morning, the Prime Minister opened a new and modern operational service building in 2015, where a meeting with the island people took place.
The debate addressed important issues for citizens, such as the development of shipping and air routes between small islands and the mainland.
The state has committed itself to ensuring regular transport connections in the small islands of permanent residence, but increasing traffic, for example during the summer period, also makes it more difficult for the local population to travel significantly.
These are places where the country can take local wishes and needs into account in the planning process early on," said the Prime Minister.
In addition, the issues of the construction, interest education, safety on the island and rescue capacity of small vessels were discussed.
Today's visit to Vorms was the last part of the Prime Minister's tour of the small islands, to explore the living environment of the islands and to discuss issues pending the settlement of local residents and local government leaders.
In July, the Head of Government Ratas Saaremaa, Kihnu, Ruhnu, Abruka and Vilsandi, and Manilaidu, have visited Naissaart, Pranglit and Aegna.
For the first time, the Central Party will go to the elections without the founding and ideological cornerstone of the party.
So far, we've said the Central Party and we've been thinking of Savisaar or the other way around.
Now the Central Party has to find a way without him.
In doing so, they also need to flinch between the party's colorful, sometimes criminal and embarrassing past, the supporters of the Savisaari party and the electorate's expectations.
The departure of the Savisaari puts the Centre Party in the most difficult situation in ideological terms.
On the basis of current political practice and ideology, it can be said that the old rhino will play them firmly.
Several cards that used to work in drums may not come true this time.
The populism card does not work for the Central Party, as Savisaar can always be allowed more than the Prime Minister's Party.
Playing on the Russian map is difficult, both because of the central party's position in the government and because we see here too how the so-called Savinova electoral union is pushing the gas down.
The card of the sufferer is already in Savisaari's pocket due to the ongoing trial.
For the Middle Party, a map of the People's Front and the poor are also missing.
The first of these is the low value of its creation and the more powerful playing of the second is hindered by the coalition partners in the government.
However, one card may be even more of a weight.
All the last elections have confirmed that the parties that can formulate and then implement the main electoral conflict are successful.
The main conflict has always been around the Savisaari.
If a party has a thought to inflate life into a well-functioning opposition, another drumstick in the Central Party card package is missing.
So what's it gonna be for the Central Party?
They still have a strong party apparatus and a considerable resource.
There will also be enough recordings before the elections.
Most of the shameless self-promotion made four years ago by the taxpayer's money has now, hopefully, been repaid to the Tallinians.
Tallinn City Media remains, but the cultivation of the political guerrilla and press has been reduced there too.
Besides, the party has voice magnets.
Their role will be to get the chestnuts out of the fire this time, because the image of the power party is not enough to motivate the voters in considerable terms.
In ideological terms, the Jüri Bike must find its way, because the journey with the clay was over this week.
Three U.S. Marines disappeared in Australian waters in an air accident.
The U.S. Navy and the Navy completed the search operation, reported the Marine Base Camp Butler in Japan in a statement, in principle confirming that the military is no longer expected to find the missing alive.
The accident took place on a Marine Airplane Osprey MV-22 that launched USS Bonhomme on board Richard.
There were 26 people on board, 23 of whom managed to find and save.
The plane that crashed into the sea took part last month in joint exercises between the United States and Australia in Shoalwater Bay, Queensland.
Australian Minister of Defence Marise Payne said that a Saturday incident took place near the coast of Shoalwater Bay.
The woman found a strange wedding ring in the washing machine. Who could it belong to?
"I started to take my laundry out of the machine when the light in between the rubber seal of the washing machine got in my eye," she says how she found a strange wedding ring in her washing machine.
In fact, Karin did not pay attention to the shine at the door of the washing machine in the first shot.
I've rebooted the machine.
"At the side of two little children, this dirty laundry is coming right now," she's sulking.
When I got through the second laundry and started to take out the laundry, I still got this light between the rubber seal of the washing machine and then I found that ring.
The name of the man who was married 14 years ago - Tomi.
Since someone in a family named a man or a woman who could be married to a Tom doesn't know, the ring is a complete mystery.
Karin studied with his older child that he might have found a ring in his yard, put it in his pocket, and that the ring had come into the washing machine, but the child confirmed that he had not brought the ring home.
Karin and his partner have lived in the flat of Madala Street in Tallinn for a year.
They used to rent it out, and the washing machine came from that time.
But if the ring had anything to do with the tenants, how did it get into the machine?
"Now I'm inquisitive and I can't figure out which way the ring went into the washing machine," she laughs.
Since the pace of life next to two young children is quite rapid, you forgot to go home at first.
"At the last time, there have been posts looking for the owner of the wedding ring, and now it seemed that it was time to look for the owner of the ring he found", Karin refers to the case in social media where the wedding ring found on Puhang Street in Tallinn found the owner happily last week.
"When they find and look for different things on Facebook, I thought first to try luck there," says Karin, whose post has already been shared by nearly 4,000 people.
"Posting has received all kinds of feedback, and not all is good," she boasts, suggesting that the first comments suggested that she take her husband to the list.
That's when I felt like I needed this shit.
That my husband has become the biggest fraud I've ever heard of.
To be honest, it made me worried at first, but later, when you came in to the comments that maybe I've been hacking the ring with the owner, it made me laugh.
The commentators also suggested that suddenly the ring reached the woman in the pocket of the second round of clothing.
"Well, the last time somewhere about six months ago, one of the second-round pants bought for work, which flew into a washing machine without a more in-depth investigation, but really?" she's discussing herself.
All right, but my life mate and I agreed that we're gonna have to find the owner of the ring now for the principle.
Whatever the reason this ring disappeared.
Divorce, family crisis, whatever.
I think it's the only thing that's going to happen, because if I ever lost a wedding ring, I know I'd be grateful to a person who'd try to find me and return a valuable asset.
Karin has also approached the family position office for help in finding the owner.
I received the answer, however, that at such a date in Estonia, and with a name like this, the gentleman has not married.
One ring has been found by the owner
Recently, the wedding ring found in Pelguranna, Tallinn, on July 21, arrived happily at the owner’s hand, whose engraving promised that it would belong to an elderly woman.
"I walked with dogs this morning, and I noticed Puhungu behind 53 houses, trapped inside the track, a golden ring," Gerli says that the engraving promised to assume that it belonged to an elderly woman.
Gerli posted a photo of the ring (on the picture) on her Facebook page and in the group "Remarked in Tallinn", shared information with the North Tallinn district and the North Prefecture.
Two weeks later, the police contacted Gerl and reported that the ring bearer had been identified.
"I got the contact of the owner's daughter, and on Monday evening she took possession of her daughter." The ring was gone, for the old lady had injured her hand and put the other finger on the ring, where it had slipped off.
"He lost it the day I walked my dog in the morning," says Gerli.
Although media attention has been focused mainly on Pärnu and the Weekly taking place there, it is not the only music festival of this weekend.
The Intikurmu festival in Põlvamaa also has loyal fans.
One of them writes on Twitter, for example, "I sold the Weekly ticket so I could go to the Instinct."
And why not?
In addition to domestic artists, performers from America, Finland, Lithuania, Hungary, England and elsewhere will also appear.
The festival in the magical forest surprises the artists that appear there due to their charming location.
One of them, Lucy Rose, was not surprised at how beautiful Estonia is this morning on Twitter.
But the visitors have not been the goats to share great things either.
To be a part of the Intsikurmu festival magic yourself, see also the galleries!
The U18 of Estonia recognized the best in the semifinal and the A division could not get away.
The match began very quickly, and in the first quarter of which the British won five points (18:23) many baskets were thrown.
During the second quarter, the gap increased further, and the guest’s nine-point progress was taken to rest (31:40).
Estonia was able to win the third quarterback, but only with one point.
The state of the Estonians' defeat before the last ten minutes was eight points (46:54).
In the fourth quarter, the game broke down completely, and ultimately the loss of 61:75 had to be accepted.
The loss destroyed the Estonians' hopes of reaching Division A, because only two of the best singles can get there.
In the third place tomorrow, Estonia will face the loser of the game between Croatia and Israel.

The Australian Leagues are on the crossroads
Professional sport stands on the crossroads in Australia: some areas have traveled so far by corporate means that they are too business-oriented to categorise sport;
Others return to the amateur world, which is too sport-oriented to consider it a business.
This confusion is evidenced by the painful delays of Cricket Australia (CA) in reaching a pay agreement with players, the indeterminate firing of the team of the Australian Ragbi Union (ARU), the rise of stakeholders from the Australian Football Federation (FFA), the difficulties of the ragbili in the assembly of an independent commission to function and the inalienable efforts of the Australian Football League (AFL) to be the flag of social justice among the people.
The investment banker and the chairman of the Australian Sports Commission, John Wylie, have tried to actively lead the Olympics to the same path as the professional leagues by placing businessmen who do not have an elite experience in sport.
The mining gigant Rio Tinto, who has a reputation for the use of trade-union tactics, was seen in the problems of collina CA in reaching an agreement with the Australian Crickets Association (ACA).
The President of the CA, David Peever, is former CEO of Rio Tinto Australia and he has hired the Head of Rio Tinto and Adviser to assist the CA in the wage negotiations.
However, it would be mistaken to believe that elite men whose approach is ruthless in their dealings with cricket players do not love this sport.
Peever was, for example, a regular visitor to Storm’s home games until he moved to another state.
Nevertheless, the harsh negotiations between CA and ACA and the extremely high wages have given the impression that Australia's summer favourites now belong more to business than to sport.
On the contrary, ARU's incompetent leader, former NAB CEO Cameron Clyde, has been unable to pick up Australian Super Rugby's team too far back to its roots.
The people of the Ragbi Union now prefer to hover to the suburban stadium to watch the game between amateur teams while drinking beer and eating hot dogs.
The Ragbilit says they have the most corporately qualified and diverse board in Australia, but too many failures in meeting the requirements of international partners show that it is still too much sport to be a business.
Both radical and football have problems with management, as stakeholders demand more power.
The chairmen of both leagues, John Grant from ARLC and Steven Lowy from FFA, have shown that their business skills have not been enough to achieve corporate stability.
Grant, former Kangaroo, ran a successful IT company, but was 20 years away from the game.
It became a value when the newly formed ARLC needed an independent chairman.
Too many stakeholders who did not trust each other decided that no one who has been involved in the Commission's work in the last three years could participate in the rag industry in any way, except as a passive fan.
Pendel, on the other hand, moved too far to the business side, and too many fans have been looking for a rescuer ever since, someone with a history in sports.
Westfield's Foreign Investment Executive Director Lowy's real FFA chairman's role from his father, Frank, one of the richest people in Australia.
The A-league Clubs want to be better represented at the Congress that elects the board.
Their owners lose money, but believe they're as valuable as Manchester United.
Ironically, FIFA is sending out ambassadors to end the civil war in sport.
The AFL has its own links with Rio Tinto through the financial manager of the recently retired Chairman, Mike Fitzpatrick and the former AFL Commissioner, Chris Lynch, the mining gigand.
The League is proud of the role of the national leader in promoting gender equality, indigenous and refugee activities and gay rights.
Some cynics might suggest that this is done in the face of government grants.
Richard Goyder, Chairman of the AFL, said, when he took over Fitzpatrick, "AFL is more than a business, considering how it helps all these communities."
Goyder will be Wesfarmers' soon-to-be CEO and AFL's first chairman, who has not played at the game's elite level.
Former Wesfarmers Chairman Bob Every is an active member of the board of Cricket Australia.
The cross-referencing of members of the Board of Directors of Professional Sports is often the importance of independence over competence.
In the tumultuous recruitment of business people, they have forgotten something that could be called affection and passion for sport.
Moreover, many corporate heavyweights are not accustomed to the intensive and sometimes personal monitoring of the media.
Something that works in a corporate world may not transfer to sport.
Flynn submitted a report on the disclosure of the corrected information showing additional payments.
Michael Flynn, who served for a short time as President Trump's National Security Adviser, submitted on Thursday a corrected report on the disclosure of federal financial information containing new details of Flynn's contracts with regard to the transfer of Trump to the President's Office, the company linked to the Iranian-American businessman and the company that worked for Trump's campaign with the company's parent company.
In a letter which sent out the information with the corrections, Flynn noted that its original disclosure reports were submitted under urgent circumstances without the regular consultation and examination provided by the White House lawyers and the Government Ethics Office.
According to the letter, Flynn did not receive any attention from others since he was no longer a White House employee at the time.
Flynn resigned from his post just 24 days after his appointment in the middle of the rumors that he had provided Vice-President Pence with misleading information on his post-election ties with the Russian ambassador in the United States.
Flynn also received criticism of the cross-border payments made to him during his private activity following the resignation of the Director of the Defence Intelligence Agency in 2014.
In the information previously published to the investigators of the Chamber of Representatives, Flynn declared that in 2015 the related entities received around $68 000 of fees and payments.
In addition to Russia-related income, the information submitted on Thursday revealed that Flynn received at least $5,000 for the consultant service for the construction project for nuclear power plants in the Middle East.
Flynn's work on the project was already made public, but it was not known that he was paid for it.
The updated information also confirms that Flynn had agreed to cooperate with the SCL Group - at the time Cambridge Analytica British parent company - that is, with the information company hired under Donald Trump's campaign.
Cambridge is one of the main donors of hedge fund magnate Robert L. Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah is a influential financial supporter of conservatives.
In February, the Washington Post announced that Flynn was hired to advise the SCL Group.
According to the persons with his role, Flynn’s aim was to help SCL’s American subsidiary to win new public contracts with the United States.
SCL also hired one of Flynn’s former colleagues to lead the efforts to award public contracts from the National Intelligence Director’s office.
Flynn claimed that he did not receive any compensation or actual work from SCL by any person known to him or her.
With the new information, it became clear that Flynn received around 28 000 dollars in connection with the transition to the Trump Presidential Office.
The largest publicised source of revenue is USD 140 000 for Flynn's work as a consultant and consultant to NJK Holding Corp in Minneapolis. This company is run by Nasser Kazeminy, a businessman born in Iran and currently living in the United States.
The Associated Press announced on Thursday evening NJK's statement that "said Flynn NJK Holdings about the interest in investing in the company's securities".
NJK finances the technology company GreenZone Systems, which is vice-chaired by Flynn.
GreenZone i runs Tuden Kian, Flynn’s business partner in Flynn Intel, which is currently under investigation because of its role in lobbying on behalf of a Dutch company linked to the Turkish Government.
Earlier on Thursday, Elijah E. Cummings (Md.) asked Kian to provide information on Flynn's foreign business contacts and travels.
During Flynn's earlier security check, Kian told military investigators that his partner had several foreign business contacts.
Cummings said that Flynn told the same investigators nothing about such contacts.
However, according to a familiar person, Flynn did undergo a security check at that time.
The main performer was revived on the stage in August, and the singer was taken to Tallinn with an ambulance.
Ivan was able to finish playing the set when he was hit by a health disorder.
An ambulance was called in, who massaged his heart for several decades," says Indrek Ditmann to Life24.
"There was a delay in the plan, but the festival goes on," he says and adds, "The public has been informed, of course they saw everything that happened on the stage."
At the moment, Ivan is on his way to Tallinn with an ambulance and it is not known whether he will survive or not.
Of course we hope for the best," says Ditmann in the end.
The eyewitness told Western life that he had a medical disorder during the performance of Denisenko.
First the man stopped singing, then the instrument went by, and the man fell on the stage.
The stage was presented by Jan Newfield, who asked if there was a doctor among the audience.
A little later, he asked me to pray for Denisenko.
Ivan Denisenko / August ibus
Ivan Denisenko, or Ivan Blues, is a well-known Ukrainian artist and cultural figure.
Ivan’s musicians began in parallel with art studies in the Ukrainian National Academy of Art and Architecture.
At the university, they were immediately inspired by his incredibly deep bass and invited to sing the nationwide folk choir of the Golden Gate.
In the choir, he became friends with people who introduced him to the blues and later became his bandmates.
The first concert of the Ivan Blues & Friends band took place on December 31, 2007 at the Kiev Bar, called Rag-Time.
Since then, the band has been operating regularly, performing in clubs, concert halls and schools across Ukraine.
English author publishes a book in the back of the book
"The Helping Hand" is the first book of Michaels, the former editor of the BBC and the mother of two children. He has previously written to Singapore Tatler.
It took three years to complete the book, and it is dedicated to his Filipino assistants Maricon Espirittu and Ginalyn Narag, who help in cooking and keeping his son, Joseph, a four-year-old, and daughter, Florence, an eight-year-old.
The assistants he describes as "family members" helped to test recipes during the writing of the book. This is the first such book in Singapore, published in both English and in the back language.
"A Helping Hand" is available in bookshops all over Singapore at 39.90 SGD and also in emigration centres abroad, including Hong Kong, Dubai, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines.
He thought he had a stomach virus from a colleague.
But why were his symptoms so different?
At the trauma point, he was given a high dose of acetaminophen to reduce fever.
For the rest of the day, he was constantly questioned, stabbed, stabbed, and investigated.
No tests showed anything, but they didn't want to send him home.
He understood the reason.
For the last two years, he had taken a medicine called etanercept to treat Sjogren’s syndrome.
The medicine reduces the ability of the immune system and limits its ability to fight infections.
Sjogren is an autoimmune disorder - a rather mysterious disease in which the body’s own white blood cells attack normal tissue, as if it were an intruder organism that sowed chaos in the glands that produce tears and saliva as well as in some joints.
Weekly injections of etanercept had been helpful by reducing joint pain.
But he knew that because of this medicine, he was quite helpless when he had a serious infection.
When acetaminophen started to work, the patient felt much better.
The doctors at the trauma station decided to leave him at the hospital for the night.
If it's a virus, as the doctors suspected, he'll be fine the next day and they'll let him go home.
When Girard first heard about his new patient, he developed a course of infections that people who were given etanercept are susceptible to.
That list was long.
The virus cannot be treated before the diagnosis, therefore it focused on bacterial infections.
One bacteria that attacks immunocompromised people is a food-borne lister.
This is often found in unpasterated milk and cheese, causing terrible nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea that he did not experience.
Legion-trade disease is another infection that is common among those taking this medicine, but has no cough or shortness of breath.
Even more common bacteria in Staphylococcus aureus can cause joint infections, but, again, he did not have joint complaints.
Nevertheless, the doctor planned to start extensive antibiotic therapy to cover all these risks.
However, when meeting the patient, it did not seem that he could suffer from a serious infection.
The doctors at the trauma site had not given him antibiotics.
The doctor had the opportunity to delay treatment with antibiotics and simply monitor and wait, but if the patient had one of the infections he had read about, the treatment could have been delayed even a few hours after death.
The fact that the patient thought he was allergic to penicillin, although he did not remember what happened when he took it, made the situation even more difficult.
It created a risk-benefit ratio shift.
A decision with generally low contributions, whether or not to start antibiotic therapy, will change if its consequences can be so dangerous.
He asked a colleague, another resident, to evaluate the patient.
Girard didn't tell his colleague that he was going to have an antibiotic treatment.
My colleague met the patient and agreed.
Although he looked good, he'd be practically vulnerable to infection.
The doctor should give the patient antibiotics.
Since the patient has a history of penicillin allergy, Girard should be allowed to test to see if he tolerates a medicine that is not penicillin but a close relative.
Girard asked me to give him a test dose.
If he had had had a serious reaction to the medicine, he would have had a rash or a fall in his blood pressure.
Neither of them happened.
Therefore, he was given the entire dose.
A few hours later, Girard got a call.
The patient's body temperature had risen to 39 degrees.
He was in a hurry to see the patient.
The patient's face shined from a thin sweat layer and his cheeks were pink.
Although he seemed uncomfortable, his heart and blood pressure were fine.
The doctor thanked himself for giving the patient antibiotics.
He asked to take another dose of Tylenol, and when his patient came over for the last time, he slept deeply.
The fever had receded.
The sweaty rubber and pink cheeks were gone.
The next night, when Girard returned to the hospital for a night shift, he first visited the patient.
She had also accepted five other patients, but Girard was most concerned about this patient at home after his daily transfer to the team.
During the hours he didn't see her, her blood system had grown in the lab.
It was too early to say exactly what it was.
It was clear, however, that this is a bacteria that is powerful enough to allow Petri to grow rapidly, and that it is not Staphylococcus aureus or legionary disease.
The list of other options was long and none of them actually saw the right one.
It took two more days before they could finally identify the bacteria.
It was a list of bacteria.
Girard, like everyone else who cared for the patient, was surprised.
As a doctor, you have images of the diseases in your head.
For Girard, the listeriosis was a disease caused by unpasteurised milk and soft cheeses, causing nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
He worked on this unusual infection further through the material and found that although people with a normal immune system may experience these symptoms, they usually recover quickly as a patient’s colleague.
However, in pregnant women, older than 65 years of age and in people with a damaged immune system, infection may develop outside the gastrointestinal tract, sometimes without showing normal symptoms, and enter the bloodstream.
From there, it can spread all over the body like a fire.
An infection of this type, called invasive listeriosis, may result in death in up to 30% of patients with this type of infection.
Indeed, although it is not as widespread as botulism, listeriosis can be just as deadly.
Early antibiotic therapy can save your life.
When it comes to food - transmitted disease, what did the food carry this bacteria?
Although the patient and his colleague had not consumed unpasteurised milk or soft cheese on the trip, this summer’s internet search in Scotland identified a list of cases related to smoked beef.
Neither of them had eaten smoked beef, but they ate some smoked salmon.
The exact source where they picked up the bacteria remained a secret.
Once the doctor’s team had learned what was wrong with the patient, they were able to adjust the antibiotics.
His three-week treatment ended in July.
The doctors advised him to take it easy until the end of the summer, but by now he feels quite well and has returned to the museum and his beloved work.
He was praised for preventing a global cyber attack.
And then he was arrested.
When the malware were first advertised in Russian underground forums in 2014 from Krono, the questionable price of $7,000 indicated that the sale of the malware was a profitable undertaking.
Kronos was advertised as a hacking tool capable of obtaining data, including usernames and passwords, PIN codes for ATMs and personal information useful in breaking security issues.
Motherboard announced on Thursday that Hutchins was held at Las Vegas Airport following a weekly visit to the security conferences Black Hat and Defcon.
He was planning to fly back to his home in Britain.
The security community reacted to the arrest of its prized star with wonder and scepticism.
Some warned that the requirements against Hutchins could harm the relationship between "white" hackers - researchers who are looking for weaknesses in the software to identify and solve problems, not to commit crimes or sow chaos - and law enforcement authorities.
Others were reluctant to believe that Hutchins could have created such software for the attack.
In July 2014, he asked on Twitter, and no one has an example of Kronos, which seems to be a strange request when he himself was the author of the malware.
Although the exact details of Hutchins’ connection to the chronicles are not clear, security investigators have often ignored legal problems by searching for vulnerable areas in their computer code.
In recent years, large tech companies have proposed "the trouble money of error" to formalise the process of reporting problems and compensating for their work for researchers.
The Defcon conference, without restrictions on the gathering of security experts from all over the world, has also had a tense relationship with law enforcement agencies.
In 2002, the FBI, for example, arrested a Russian encryption expert in a hotel room in Las Vegas after publishing software that, according to the authorities, could harm the security of certain types of e-books.
In his statement, the Digital Rights Organisation stated that he was concerned about the arrest of Hutchins and was looking into it.
WannaCry's ransomware infected computers with Microsoft Windows older versions.
After spreading, encrypted software from computers and locked user files, folders and disks.
When the infected device was connected to the network, other devices in the network could also be infected.
The attackers demanded that the victims pay hundreds of dollars to the bitcoin address.
Hutchins became a so-called random hero.
The interview to The Guardian in May told Hutchins that he registered a web domain after discovering that malicious software was trying to connect with it.
By registering the domain for $10.69, he launched a so-called kill switch that stopped the software from spreading.
His original intention was not to stop the attack, but to monitor its spread.
Hutchins, who works as a researcher at Kryptos Logic, a cyber security company in Los Angeles, said in an interview that he did not go to college and has learned to write his own software.
The company did not make any comments.
Hutchins tried to remain anonymous by communicating with the media through his length of MalwareTech, but the British tabloids revealed his identity.
He was praised in the cybersecurity community for this achievement and received special recognition at the SC Awards Europe Industry event.
The Senate confirmed Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets ambassador in Britain.
Johnson was Trump's largest financial supporter during the presidential campaign and was appointed financial manager of his Inauguration Committee in November.
The long-term Republican donor Johnson also helped raise money for George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney when they were party candidates.
He used to be a financial manager of Jeb Bush during the 2016 campaign.
Johnson’s grandfather set up a company that produces medical supplies, Johnson & Johnson.
In the past, Matthew Barzun was the ambassador of the United States of America in Britain.
Barzuni appointed Barack Obama in 2013 and he resigned from his post in January of this year before Trump's oath.
Belgian officials already knew about egg contamination in June
"We knew at the beginning of June about possible problems with insecticide fipronil," said Katrie Stragier, the Belgian Food Safety Press Officer, in the VRT religion.
We started the investigation immediately and talked to the D.A.'s office about it, because it may have been a fraud.
From there, the investigation became a secret.
We understand that people have health issues and we try to answer them," Stagier added.
The news agency AFP has been trying to get information from the D.A.'s office in the last few days, but he didn't say anything because the investigating judge banned the publication of the information.
Eggs have been withdrawn as a precautionary measure in Belgium until the results of the analyses have been established.
Millions of Dutch eggs withdrawn from sale in the Netherlands and Germany.
The German Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt has called on the Dutch and Belgian authorities to bring the matter to light quickly.
"No one has obviously contaminated eggs with a criminally banned product," said Schmidt to the German newspaper Bild.
According to the Estonian Veterinary and Food Administration (VTA), eggs contaminated with pesticides produced in the Netherlands are unlikely to exist in Estonia.
"There are no Dutch eggs in Estonia according to us," said VTA pressman Martin Altaja BNS.
He added that there are no other products produced from Dutch eggs in Estonia either.
According to Statistics Estonia, eggs have not been imported from the Netherlands in the last 10 years.
The last eggs were imported from the Netherlands into Estonia in 2006.
The Dutch authorities suspect that the plague fipronil reached the canals due to the attempt by the Dutch company Chickfriend to treat the hens that suffered.
The Dutch and Belgian media reports that the substance containing the pesticide reached Chickfrienden via the Belgian company have not yet been confirmed.
In larger quantities, fipronil is reported by the World Health Organization to be moderately dangerous and may have adverse effects on human populations, especially children, kidneys, liver and thyroid glands.
Is there finally a solution to the problem of tedious robot calls?
For Michael Rizzo, answering the phone is often a waste of time.
His Sports City Pizza Pub in Buffalo, New York, depends on customers calling and ordering chicken wings, pizza and potato pilots.
But most of the time, it's automatic messages trying to push fraud through.
"It's getting to the point that it doesn't allow other callers to catch us," said the 24-year-old bar owner.
Help is on its way, though slowly.
During the last year, new tools have been added to mobile phones, with the inspiration of the government, to prevent unwanted "robot calls".
The Federal Communications Commission has proposed enabling telephone companies to block more spam calls and hopes to scare fraud with large fines.
According to the experts, these steps are not the final solution, but they are a good start.
Federal and state-owned non-voting lists should protect people from unwanted calls from distance distributors.
But the traitors don't care that they break the law.
The traitors reach people cheaply and easily, using "auto-choicers", which automatically make many calls at a time.
It is estimated that Americans receive tens of millions of robot calls a day.
Of course, not all of them are fraudulent.
Pharmacies send, for example, automated messages on how to execute prescriptions.
But all too often, you owe money to the tax administration; Microsoft calls to fix your computer; free cruise is offered!
In addition, garbage speakers use complex technology that shows a local or important-looking number on the phone, such as the Tax Administration.
The implementation of appropriate measures for "reflecting" numbers would make fraud more difficult and help consumers in the United States to save millions of dollars, as claimed by the FCC group of state prosecutors.
Telephone companies and independent applications can screen or block unwanted calls compared to known database of problem numbers and analyse suspicious behaviours such as a number that calls many people in non-speakable lists.
Wireless service providers also have tools that add such warnings to incoming calls as "Possibly fraud", but they are not available on all phones and to many customers with prepaid cards.
They can be ordered from Verizon and Sprint for an extra fee.
Some Android phones, including Google Pixel, screen spam calls for free.
Multimedia producer Jen Vargas (39) from Orlando, Florida, said that his AT&T app labeled and blocked certain fraud calls on his cell phone, but he has abandoned his phone lines.
"I rarely receive calls from numbers I don't know," said Vargas.
Applications such as YouMail and Nomorobo offer home phones free of charge but with limited relief.
In the case of YouMail, the operator must allow "conditional call guidance", which will pass the calls on if the line is not answered or busy.
Nomorobo is not available for all home telephone service providers and does not work on older copper-based telephone lines.
It is also possible to buy gadgets, some of which are rather congested, which block calls on home phones.
Verizon will also test the display of warnings about suspicious calls on home phones.
Telephone companies are already able to block certain calls that are fraudulent.
The FCC has proposed rules to formalise such practices and allow for the blocking of other suspected fraud calls.
This means that Verizon can block a tax-free number that receives calls for payment, but never initiates any.
Operators would also be able to block calls where they know that they are not legitimate, e.g. 911 direction numbers.
These rules still need to be finalised.
Maureen Mahoney, a public policy aspirant in a non-profit-making consumer union, said that these developments are 'probative', but do not protect consumers from all unwanted calls.
Firstly, non-voting-lists do not apply to certain types of callers, such as debt collectors and political campaigns.
Moreover, according to Mahoney, FCC rules would cover only counterfeit numbers.
Not all robot calls are meant to be cheated.
The Consumers' Union would like telephone companies to make voice blocking tools available free of charge to all consumers.
In the longer term, the FCC supports the efforts of the industry to confirm that the caller is indeed who he claims to be.
Perhaps one day you can see a green bird on your smartphone screen if the caller is right.
The U.S. Telecom lobby says it may take several years to put it into practice, but it would be a powerful tool against robot speakers.
The FCC is also looking for ways to stop tedious calls to consumers who exchange numbers.
If you register now in the non-voting list, but obtain a new number later, the distributor may not know it and may start to bother with the new line.
"Robot speakers are not going anywhere," said Aaron Foss of Nomorobos, a service for blocking calls for mobile phones and home phones.
"They're criminals and find a new way to bypass any system.
But our job is to make it as complicated as possible for them."
There are a number of logical measures that consumers should take.
Don't answer the phone if you don't know the number.
Yeah, unfortunately, it's not practical for corporate phone calls like Sports City.
Abort unwanted calls.
Do not speak up or press any buttons.
If you communicate with them, they may record you as someone who responds and bury you in more calls.
If possible, block the number after the call.
Use calls blocking applications.
If you have concerns about privacy, check the application rules to see if they share your voice or contact information with distributors.
Do not provide telephone calls with personal data such as a bank account or social security number.
Mount Rasmus: preparation has not gone quite the way I saw it in my eyes
"Not everything has been exactly the way I saw it in my eyes," said Mägi of the previous trainings to MM.
On Friday-Saturday, there are important moments that show how the body is exactly.
And the competition will show us what we're doing here anyway.
Today, I believe that my preparations have been high-quality, both this year and in previous years, so that it is possible to run from it normally.
On Sunday, according to Estonian time, Mägi, who started the 13.05 pre-runs, has not dealt with anything special since the home championships.
In recent weeks, workouts are often hurt.
I should have a freshie, and it might be very useful that the last week before the M.M.I. was a little easier.
The days left on the physical side are like this: yesterday the hurdler rested, today makes a warm exercise.
However, he does not want to go into his spiritual preparation: "I have developed my own routines over time.
There's a lot of silence and peace, and I'm not gonna put any rock music on my ears.
I don't need to watch any motivating videos or read self-help lessons, but be here and at this point assess the possibility that athletes from all over the world have come together to compare their abilities in one place.
It's a special thing in itself.
The MM has, of course, been the top event of the year for every lightweight player, and the Mägi has taken the test of every previous start, including competitions in the Diamond League - tried some technical nuances, compared to some competitors.
The title contests are no longer available for experimentation.
"The goal here is simply to run quickly", says Mägi, but adds that if the pre-run and potentially also the semi-final succeed in leaving even a percent or a few of the energy in reserve, they will certainly benefit from the next run.
The Finns had a dance for their men.
When the first men's dance was held in Rakvere 11 years ago, the organisers probably never dreamed of the northern neighbours setting an example for a small town in Estonia.
Today, however, the first Finnish men's dance is held in Lappua, Western Finland.
"The representatives of the town of Lapua were so excited with the dance of the men in Rakvere that you wanted to arrange something similar," said Kairit Pihlak, Deputy Mayor of Rakvere.
"This is how 2 performances of Man-Dance Festival will take place today at the Lapua baseball stadium in Finland in the framework of Finland's 100 parties, including 100 men from Virumaa," said Pihlak.
According to Pihlaku, this is an excellent example of good cooperation between the two twin cities of friendship.
It also celebrates the anniversary years of the Republics of Estonia and Finland.
Among the hundreds of dancers are the Rocket 69 winner of the previous season in Karl Remmeubya.
"I have the honour of being one of the 100 men who, with their participation in Finland, show what Viru's men are capable of," he said.
"The men dancing in Rakvere have put all their joints in order to show proper levels to the northern neighbours in preparation for the dance of Finnish men," commented Ain Suurkaev, member of Rakvere City Government.
Virumaa’s men’s performance has been set by the dance band Tarvanpää artistic director Tiiu Poison with the well-known choir leader Elo Yliojak.
Estonian choreography is based on Estonian choir music.
The first dance of Estonian men was held in 2006, and so far the latter was held in Rakvere in 2015.
In anticipation of the evening's disc emissions final: Does Gerd Kanter make MM's history?
The current MM is the eighth for Kanter, none of his competitors in London have achieved this.
In addition, Kanter is the only disk thrower through history who has won a full set of medals (gold, two silver and two bronze) from MMi.
As of today (5 August 2017), Kanter is 38 years old and 92 days old.
If an Estonian throws himself as a double world champion, he will be the oldest disc player in the World Cup who has won the gold medal.
A similar opportunity exists for the Polish violent Pjotr Malachowski (at 34 and 60 days of age).
More exciting facts:
More than once, only two national athletes have become the world champion of disk emissions.
Germany has nine gold medals, two in Lithuania.
The World Championship record belongs to Virgilijus Alekna’s title, which was issued in Helsinki (in 2005) 70.17.
The lowest result that has been won is 66.20 - it was done on Riedel (1991).
The results of the study show that the beetles also spread seeds
Like birds and mammals, cockroaches spread seeds.
These insects are mainly known as breakers that help to break down substances that rot under the forest into pieces.
The cockroaches, however, also help to spread seeds.
Japanese scientists discovered that cockroachs play an important role in the distribution of seeds to the hum of the forest species Monotropastrum.
It's an unusual plant.
It does not contain chlorophylle and is therefore not capable of photosynthesis.
Instead, the species receives its nutrients from underground mushrooms.
The plant will plant small, odourless and pale white fruits on the forestbed.
The grains have very little or no taste, and Japanese researchers found that the species of birds and mammals are not interested in them as a food source.
Only a handful of vertebrates consumed by the fruit and forested cockroach Blattella nipponica was the only species that regularly visited the fruits.
The researchers checked the stools of the cockroaches to determine whether these insects would help to spread plant seed.
Scientists found that each fecal sample after eating the fruit contained an average of three seeds.
Further tests confirmed that most of the indigestioned seeds were viable.
Scientists assume that this unique plant species is likely to have learned to exploit the ability to spread the seeds of rosaceans during evolution.
The fruits of the plants hang close to the ground and are produced at the same time as the cockroaches leave their larvae.
Researchers published their findings this week in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.
"In view of the fact that about 4600 cockroach species have been identified so far, the distribution of seeds through cockroaches can be a much more extensive and still undocumented mechanism, not just the unique ability of a particular plant species to exploit cockroaches," said NATO Sugiura, co- Professor at the University of Kumamoto in the press release.
"It is expected that revealed findings will encourage people to pay more attention to the relationship between plants and cockroaches and to look for further examples of how the cockroaches distribute seeds."
The Duchess of Cambridge's childhood should have had the right to die.
Her mother said that a child friend with the deadly disease of the Duchess Cambridge should have been allowed to end her life.
Isobel Kennerley, a member of the Duchess's Gadget Group, begged after three years of struggle with a brain tumor that caused him "extreme pain, suffering and loss of dignity" to be allowed to die.
In a 34-year-old woman with cerebral paralysis, a brain tumor was diagnosed in 2014, but according to her mother, she suffered terribly before she died in May.
Christine Eley, 65, from Newbury, Berks, has called for the amendment of the law that would enable people suffering from a deadly disease and with mental competence to "control their death" in a way and timing.
He said that his daughter's painful death caused a "serious trauma" in her and wished that the law had allowed her to put in place a plan that would have enabled her to die with dignity when her condition deteriorated.
Chinese online sensors play a complicated cat and mouse game
According to the experts, the shift, which could affect a large number of users from researchers to companies, suggests that China is increasingly concerned about the power of the Internet.
"It seems that restrictions are getting more intense, but at the same time the Internet is more powerful than ever," said Emily Parker, who has written the book "Now I Know Who My Comrades Are" on Internet influence in China, Cuba and Russia.
The restrictions on the Beijing Internet are proportionate to the influence of the Internet in China.
According to experts, Chinese control has not yet been fully strengthened and in many cases the game of cat and mouse continues.
One day after Apple's move last week, people started spreading in Chinese social media a way to get access to tools that were so simple that even a technical stranger could do it.
This included the registration of a human app store in another country where VPN applications are still available.
However, the Thursday test shows that China wants to change the game in favour of the cat.
Several Chinese Internet Service Providers stated on Thursday in their social media accounts, websites or emails that Chinese security officials are testing a new way to find internet addresses for services that host or use illegal content.
Once they have been found, the authorities will, according to these companies, ask the internet service providers to require their customers to cease such activities.
Where customers continue, the service providers and the Chinese officials shall interrupt their connection within minutes.
The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a faxed request to comment on the matter.
Research suggests that tens of millions to hundreds of millions of people in China use VPN and other types of software to get past the Great Fire Wall.
Although blockades on foreign television programmes and pornography put a lot of people away, they pose only small challenges to the enormously large community of online users in China.
China’s President Xi Jinping has been responsible for new internet control elements over the years, but has also highlighted technology and the Internet as critical factors for China’s future economic development.
Since cyberspace has begun to play a more central role in the whole of China, the control elements of the government have developed.
It is difficult to identify the scope of the new efforts, since many users and companies do not discuss them publicly, fearing to become a party to the abuse of the Chinese government.
However, some frequent users have said that getting past restrictions is becoming increasingly difficult.
One student who studies in the United States and returned to China for a summer vacation said that his local VPN was blocked.
According to her, she took this period away from social media as a certain type of meditation, and she left a message to her friends to explain why she had sunk.
A Ph.D. student at one of the universities of China said that without Google research has become more difficult, although the university has found alternative publications that students would not always need the Internet.
According to him, he has now found a new way to pass through the Great Fire Wall without disclosing what is at stake.
According to Chinese internet observers, some VPNs are still working and China could do much more to intensify the restrictions.
"We believe that if the government had decided to do so, it would have stopped the use of VPN much more by now," said VPNDada, a website created in 2015 to help Chinese users find VPNs, a representative.
"If the government had sent out more cats, it would be much more difficult for mice," said the representative, who refused to mention himself because of the delicateness of the group's work in China.
"They obviously didn't do it because they have to leave people or businesses some breathing space."
China's online restrictions are often cyclical.
The current climate is partly due to the important meeting of the Chinese Communist Party, which will be the 19th Congress of the Party in autumn.
Five years ago, VPN was hit by unforeseen interruptions before such a meeting.
Like economic policy or foreign affairs, the central part of China is a complex and often incomplete political process.
According to analysts, government ministries are under pressure before the Party Congress to show that they are effective and able to intervene in the event of a problem.
"This is certainly not the Apocalypse of the VPNs," said Paul Triolo, head of the Global Technology Department of the Eurasia Group.
"A more complex environment and new opportunities and approaches for users enable China to simply switch off certain parts of the use of VPN at the selected time and place in Beijing," he said.
The Chinese population is learning to cope with these difficulties at an early age.
Earlier this summer the Chinese Internet giant Tencent began to limit the time during which younger than 18 are allowed to play the popular online game "Honor of Kings", allowing it to be done an hour a day for those who are younger than 12 and two hours for those who are 12-18 years old.
Therefore, Chinese young people have begun using the ancient solution - fake documents.
Is your Honor of Kings game time limited?
Are you interested in obtaining a document that shows that you are older than 18?" asked a recent advertisement in Chinese social media.
"No problem.
Contact me to get a cheap document."
Estonian heavy-duty horses will be evaluated in the Museum of Agriculture tomorrow
On this Saturday, August 5, the Estonian Day of Heavy Horses will take place at the Estonian Agricultural Museum.
The Estonian heavy-duty horse is one of the three Estonian horse breeds next to the Estonian horse and tori horse.
This year, the day of heavy-duty horses will take place 23rd time, and 17 heavy-duty horses from all over Estonia will arrive at the event of the year of work horses.
On that day, young Estonian heavy-duty horses, seals and mares will be compared and evaluated.
In addition, the work carried out by the best breeders is recognised.
There are more than 350 Estonian heavy-duty horses at risk.
The conservation of the breed and the use of the horses are also introduced in Ülenurme.
On the same day, it is possible to visit the exhibitions of the Estonian Agricultural Museum, get to know EV100 cereal and rye fields and participate in thematic workshops.
The activities are available to visitors of all ages.
There are exciting games for children, the opportunity to ride a pony or a horse, participate in a drawing competition and visit the Science Theatre of the Three Piglets.
There is also a summer hall offering Estonian food and craft goods.
Estonia’s heavy-duty horses day is organised jointly with the Estonian Horse Breeders’ Society, the Estonian Heavy-duty Horse Breeders’ Association and the Estonian Agricultural Museum.
Breeders are supported by the Estonian Association of Tõululomatuksen.
The cancer nurse cat Genie was named a cat for a year.
The rescued cat, who was a supporter of its owner during treatment for bone cancer, was designated a cat for the year of the state.
Genie was recognized for comforting her owner, Evie Henderson (11), from Lincoln during the six chemotherapy sessions.
Evie was diagnosed with bone cancer in March 2016 and Genie’s company was able to cope with several painful surgery and long-term hospital time.
Cats was recognised by Cats Protection at a ceremony in London.
Image signature: Evie said the cat was there for her when she lost her long brown hair because of chemical therapy.
"I think he's the best.
He deserves it.
He's always been there for me," Evie said.
"He came to my cast and sat next to my feet.
He smelled a cast and then jumped on the couch to pat on my knee with his paws.
When I was too sick to visit or go out, and I had to sit at home, he came to me, and it made me so much happier, offering great comfort."
According to Evie, she has a special connection with her pet, which was a tremendous support when she lost her hair because of her exhausting treatment.
"It made me very upset because I had long brown hair.
But since it was spring, Genie had the same hair, and the fact that I lost my hair and Genie's own, relieved the whole shock a little."
Evie's father, Chris Henderson, said that the cat has been a "excellent attention distributor" and described how Evie used to watch her beloved favorite videos in a hospital bed.
"Evie was in the hospital for over 300 days, so we spent a lot of time there, and it offered her something to look forward to when she got home for a valuable day."
11-year-old said, "I missed him every day when I was in the hospital, and my family said that he missed me too.
He's my best friend, and I really don't know what I'd do without him."
Report: Mueller convened the jury in Russia's investigation
The Wall Street Journal announced on Thursday that a jury of jury officers has been convened by a special prosecutor investigating possible links between the Presidential campaign of Russia and Donald Trump.
The newspaper reports that the jury is a new and significant step forward in the investigation of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller as regards whether Trump or his main advisors have been holding a conspiracy with Moscow to promote the 2016 presidential campaign of the Republicans.
NBC News has previously announced that before Mueller, a former FBI director, who is now in charge of this critical investigation, the state prosecutors had used the jury collections as part of the investigation of former State Security Advisor Michael Flynn and Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort.
One of the president's personal lawyers, John Dowd, told NBC News that he wasn't aware that Mueller had started using the jury.
"We've been working with Bob Mueller and his team since June 1st because we want to get over it," he said.
"In the light of the news of the convening of the federal jury, we have no reason to believe President Trump is under investigation."
NBC News has not independently verified the Journal data.
The use of the jury is a normal part of a complex investigation, and it is not a tool aimed only at listening to testimony but also at obtaining information and obtaining data from individuals or companies.
It's a powerful tool that prosecutors can use to press charges and court-martials, and it may indicate that Mueller's work has not been done at all.
Trump has denied that he or one of his team members was planning a campaign with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Moscow officials have also denied the role of playing Trump's surprising victory last November.
The President's Special Adviser, Ty Cobb, said that he was not aware that Mr Mueller had started using the new jury.
"The body of seniors is usually secret," said Cobb in the statement.
The White House is in favour of anything that speeds up the completion of his work fairly.
The White House is fully committed to working with Mueller.
Former FBI director Jim Comey has said three times that the president is not under investigation, and we have no reason to believe that things have changed."
"A flying American" under a black sail
Of course I've heard of flying ships.
Who wouldn't?
After all, the tigers go between Tallinn and Helsinki several times a day.
It's nothing special.
The Swiss company Supramar brought the first "foiliva" boat, Frecca d'Oro or Golden Arrow to the market in 1952.
The technology was there before, but now I'm standing in front of a wind-moving base.
A catamaran, but still a sailboat.
What formula is that supposed to take off?
However, let us save ourselves from the formula (it is not difficult to find) and take a look at the concept of "foiling" by a simple peasant.
Why do the planes stay in the air?
The shape of the wing is that when the plane moves forward at high speed, the air under and above the wing generates aerodynamic lifting force due to the difference in pressure at different speeds, at one point it exceeds the mass of the aeroplane and lifts the whole machine into the air.
The process is essentially the same in water.
A wing with the right shape generates lifting force as it moves forward at high speed, and that, in turn, lifts the "wrong" base out of the water.
It's easy, isn't it?
It's complicated when you get to the numbers.
The plane needs a minimum speed of 150-250 km/h to take off; the world record of sailing speed is currently "only" 121.1 km/h.
But let us not get stuck in high school physics.
Today I've come to see a flying catamaran called NACRAF20 Carbon FCS.
NACRA will meet with the leading stars of the North American Catamaran Racing Association.
FCS is a short flight control system.
It's a system that allows the crew to configure the base also in the middle of a "flight", and 20 shows the length of the sail in the legs.
As soon as the catamaran is released from the roof, it is clear that this is not a gentleman's Sunday sail.
Dr. Monokkel and Captain Sameves are on the dock today.
The pipe and the glasses couldn't fit on board.
This is hardcore.
It's the Speed Cube.
"This is a carbon fibre?" I ask, pointing to the sail.
Yeah, it's all a carbon fibre.
I don't really get it.
"No, the whole boat," sounds like a weak answer.
170 kilos - the three of us who are going on board will certainly weigh more than 170 kilos.
I'm gonna compare everything from the washroom to the cars until the nightfall, and I'm not gonna get around it here either.
Damn Zonda R or Ferrari FXX.
Built with one specific objective - to drive well-frequently in controlled conditions.
An expert hobby sailor would also be shocked by the amount of security equipment that must be put on before going to sea.
Waterproof suit, interlocks, special-cuffed beans, sail gloves, harnesses, special life jacket, helmet.
In battle equipment, it seems that the oxygen cylinder, in addition and as well as the sea, could go colonizing Mars.
"Is there a great chance of going around?" I ask in a funny tone.
"Yes," sounds like a short answer.
"You've been around a lot?" I'm still on the surface.
Okay, it's not gonna be a joke.
I'll fasten my seat belt.
The fact that Nacra F20 FCS needs an auxiliary boat and a minimum of two crew members to get to sea also highlights the purpose.
Three maximum, so there's not a lot of room.
It's starting to wonder why it's not a Sunday cruiser.
Leili forest history " Blog Archive " Renovation of land and roads
Once in a while, I am bound to see all kinds of land repair work, whether in the forest or in the field.
Machines and the quality of works have improved considerably and everything is going to happen more strongly than in its own time.
Currently, land improvement sites are mainly reconstructed, errors and congestion are sought and corrected.
More stringent environmental requirements have been added, which were not addressed decades ago.
Construction materials have been upgraded, for example, plastic tubes are now being used to build screws instead of the old concrete pipes, and fabric, known as geotextile, is being used to secure ditches in addition to stones.
In the past, kisses and trusts were secured with cast concrete plates (MP, VKP) and rottings.
In order to protect the environment, sediments should be excavated to the natural streams or rivers prior to the arrival of drainage waters (sub-ground discharges, ditches) which should clear the water of potential residues of arable fertilisers and toxins.
In the bottom of new sediment pools or ponds, wolves are often planted, or they begin to grow themselves from the seeds that have flown there.
The wolves have the ability to filter toxic substances out of the water.
The pond in the picture was dug last year and this week the surface of the silhouette was flat, a well of concrete rings was built to take firewater.
And so that some of the machines wouldn't hit the pond, they probably had big rock noises on the ground.
In the surrounding area, the improvement of forest roads is also under way in addition to the cleaning of arable crops.
The interforest road section in the picture should be part of the open road, which will also receive additional gravel cover.
The state forest will be left to the right, the road to be reconstructed will immediately continue from the skull to the right and will soon be ready.
There's a private forest on the left.
The water road is moving on and so is the renewal of the arable crayons and roads and the correction of the drought faults that have become apparent.
