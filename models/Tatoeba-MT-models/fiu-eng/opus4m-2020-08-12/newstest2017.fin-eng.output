The 28-year-old chef was found dead at the mall in San Francisco.
The 28-year-old chef who just moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of the local shopping center this week.
But the victim's brother says that he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him and says, "His business was finally going well."
The body found in the Westfield Mall Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Franciscoan Frank Galicia, a San Francisco coroner's office.
San Francisco Police Department said that death was a homicide and that an investigation is under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the KGO of the ABC channel that Frank, who had previously served as a bus stop in Boston, had received his dream job as a liner at the Sanfrancisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
Sons & Daughters' representative said they were "astonished and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that works like a tight family, and we will miss him very much," said the representative.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank spent the night in the hostel, but that recently "his business was finally going well".
"He found an apartment and dated a girl," Louis Galicia told the KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind enough to have a big heart.
His way of feeling cohesion with the family was to cook us, make dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was a brother who drove with the power.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a unsanded diamond that shined brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with information will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Department hotline number 415-575-444.
Doctoral trainees strike: Requirements for new work-fighting measures
The representatives of the doctors have asked their trade union to adopt new work-related measures in their dispute regarding the new agreement.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) invites the Council as a whole to support new labour-fighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC says that the ministers have failed to address concerns about the agreement.
In July, doctors and doctor students voted to reject the agreement that had been agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of the members who voted.
In his letter to the members of the JDC President Ellen McCourt, published on Thursday evening via Twitter, said that the government had kept "self-sufficiently silent" on issues which he said led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said, "In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject the proposed new agreement completely and to call for formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain authorisation for the progressive and expanding work-fighting programme starting early in September.
The dispute has resulted in doctors participating in six strikes this year, including the first complete work stop in the history of the NHS health care system.
The director of BMA medical practitioners, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote had been rejected the terms recommended by BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before 54 000 doctoral interns and students voted that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Jeremy Hunt, Minister of Health, said that the agreement would be imposed on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an external association?
Ele, who ended up in a crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met to shake hands and declare the battle for words and economic sanctions lasting eight months officially concluded.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of the Palace of St. Petersburg, I got the clear impression that Ankara is more desired than this reconciliation.
Yes, the event was handled.
But Putin’s smile seemed violent, and he did not boast much of the heat, even according to his own restrained standards.
On the other hand, Recep Tayip Erdogan kept talking about his "loved friend" Putin five times, according to a report.
I lost count.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even to a better level.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan's behavior as if nothing bad ever happened.
In my opinion, his zeal was a reflection of the opposite.
But the glow of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the reason for the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabbed Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from an assumed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led to an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were guilty of everything.
The most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade from the Syrian territories controlled by Isis.
He's been emphatically denying this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia has gained some kind of victory.
The benefits of agreeing to a strict weapon are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all his potential friends after he was almost expelled from power in the failed coup last month.
He has also been clearly shaken by the continued terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which generally carry several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved as flights finally continue.
They're hoping for a late-season storm.
And already this week, state television has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables since the re-entry of agricultural products from Turkey.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as described in the report of the newspaper "Vademosti".
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
The harsh ones are angry at the West for what is considered to be a weak response to the attempted coup.
Adding to it a long-lasting resentment from the advanced EU membership negotiations, Putin, who is eager to exploit the coolness and break the ties of Turkey to the West, will emerge.
I am sure the Russian leader got a break from Ankara, where he called after the revolution attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a survival for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of the change of power.
So this meeting in the prameic seaport allowed Russia and Turkey to introduce a 'external alliance', as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries who experience the Western countries abandoned them and treated them wrongly, combining their forces.
However, these two have major differences, despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of the peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be much to say that after almost three hours of initial discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with the matter.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question in relation to their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear agreement on where they can look for a common ground with regard to Syria.
After months of open hostilities, and given the possibility of a full disaster, the NATO member when he shoots down a Russian combat plane, it is certainly better that the two leaders are back in touch.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to the back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s international objectives.
Since the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved, it has abandoned these objectives.
During this time, the Bank's strategies have used the 'RBS' brand to protect other consumer financing brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used to sponsor international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it is considered right to let more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is used with Scottish customers, but it will not start again.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except the headquarters and stock exchanges are converted into NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a customer and staff tour in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will become our investor brand and our employees' employer because we will now become a much more brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local targets.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is now time for us to move towards the brand bank, because basically (we have been asking questions) it is about how we can concentrate on this to make it a better bank for our customers," said the CEO.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we have done focused on the needs of our customers, not ours, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins in Newmarket with Predilection and wins 3,000
Detori sprays champagne after he has a total of 3000 winnings after the double win.
Competitor Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3,000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved a milestone in his second victory in his home career in competition with John Gosden’s trained Predilection.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this milestone in racing.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey detori, who used to win at Ghayár, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional, because my family's here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori absorbs cheers when he catches Predilection up after victory.
Two racers have achieved this milestone in the obstacle competitions... champion jockey Richard Johnson... and a retired 20-time champion, Sir Anthony McCoy, who has recorded more than 4300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9 times Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racers of the present age, and it is not surprising that he has achieved this milestone, which few have achieved before him.
He's elegant and strong, but his tactical abyss separates him from the others in the weighing room.
He's a great ambassador for competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the species for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have rode with 6,000 winners if he wasn't just the jockey of the weekend and the big race!
Seriously, Frankie has been riding the winners in Britain for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is a good thing for the British competition, but in addition to being an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a drone landing from the saddle.
To fly from endings to drone landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of a British race racer for two decades.
This has been a mountain trail.
A lot of profits in the big games, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' victory in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and suffered from a ban on competition due to drugs.
Three years ago, it was difficult for him to return after a six - month ban, but he showed considerable strength in challenging suspects and returning to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time, but Dettor has said earlier that he would like to continue to compete for at least 50 years.
Russian Putin to be separated by Sergei Ivanov, Chief of Staff
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly dismissed Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The age of 63 has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
The Kreml opinion said that Putin has "ordinated Ivanov to move away from the role of the leader of the Russian presidential regime", but this was not justified.
Since 2012, the Deputy Director of Ivanov, Anton Vaino, has been appointed his successor.
He's a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, Estonia in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the president's protocol and government staff, says the Kremlin website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State, as regards the drafting of laws and the management of the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be left and recommended that He should be replaced.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served as a Soviet security service in the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on state television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite smiling at the cameras, only a few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is just some kind of power struggle after all?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been accepted with real suspicion.
In his comments to Putin on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that early in 2012 I asked you to give me this very complicated task, I could even say, in the debate for four years.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He used to be Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service at the KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the State Security Service in FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed vice-president of the KGB.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second period, as Putin's third period would have been against the Constitution.
However, this assignment went to another ally close to Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he returned to President only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson got fired after beating a producer.
Last month, Gibson was involved in a physical dispute at the scene of the series in Los Angeles.
A series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his resignation in the joint opinion.
A special agent named Aaron Hotchner, Gibson, made an apology on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
There were creative differences and disputes at the scene.
I regret that it happened," he said in his statement.
According to the statement by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character will be removed from a series of FBI agents' team will be expected later.
Previously, 54-year-olds who have starred Dharma & Greg have been in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it everything I have done for the last 12 years," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I'd hoped I'd been with you to the end, but that's not possible right now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible working group and, above all, the best fans that the series can have.
The start of the twelfth production period of the series is planned for 28 September.
Mysterious fish ended up in the garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windfish left behind by a water cycle.
Bain, who lives 500 feet [500 m] from the sea, published film material in Periscope, hoping that someone would bring clarity to the appearance of fish of two inches [2 inches].
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends to Fife
The €1.35 billion project is now expected to be ready by May 2017.
Engineers have combined the northern deck of the Queensferry crossing and the ground bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It's the first of the four brackets between the "cans", which are now finishing the bridge around each of the three pillars.
The bridge share of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 gauze ropes.
The €1.35 billion project is now expected to be ready by May 2017.
The Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from country to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing.
We are witnessing all the really impressive engineering work in this project, using more than 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel alone to build this section of the bridge."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the finalisation of the bridge between the ground bridge and the bridge is a demanding operation in which the extremes must be compatible.
Overall, almost 79% of the bridge is now in place and your last piece of concrete is lying in Rosyth today, which means that the entire deck is ready to be placed on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Head of Fort Crossing Bridge Constructions, said: "The first lock in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the top of construction technology.
After the last part of the road cover had been installed and combined with the expanding northern column of the road cover, we had to close the remaining part of the northern side, i.e. the inland side.
This was done by drawing the northern route’s land bridge 700 millimeters southward.
This was a huge and, at the same time, very demanding measure.
It is huge because it is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and was to be pulled at an angle of approximately 3%.
It is demanding because the allowed deviations that the team was working on were tiny, only a few millimetres in each direction.
I'm glad everything went well, though.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy when they're alive"
Three men are "happy when they're alive" after they fall off of their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station alarmed at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event take place in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim safely as their boat went on to itself.
"We saw the boat roaming closer to the men and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, the man on the rescue boat of Moelfre.
Fortunately, the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got there, he added.
A local fishing boat saved two of the men, and a third, 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging out of a boy without a life jacket.
The men were taken to the coastal rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
In the boat's engine there was a stop sign, but somehow it had broken off the boat from the person who was driving it when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunting for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather spend their free time looking at the screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and participate in some activity.
The display time was originally limited to television, then video games, and now to smartphones recently.
So it is wonderful to see that technology and outdoor activity do not rule out each other.
I am referring, of course, to the wildness called Pokémon Go. The app is based on characters originally developed for video games in the 1990s (later they became a series of drawings, playing cards and other follow-up products).
Like many of the phenomena of pop culture, its popularity had somewhat diluted before this new game was published in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
Then the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
Only days Pokémon Gola had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
As explained in the nutshell, players use their smartphones when searching for Pokémons, which are traced by GPS, and which can be "photographed" after being found (by using a screenshot of the phone) or "caught".
The generation that played the game when they were younger has joined the wildness and jumped up from the couch to search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "average person".
The Apple Watch app, following 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the release of the game, the number of people moving from 45% to 53% of the users following the Cardiogram jumped from 30 minutes a day.
The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Gota, it only sees the training level data.
Many public health campaigns' calls for "find 30", "rise on the couch" and "be active every day" have not produced any results because most public health warnings are boring and cared for by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical activity cannot be underestimated.
Regularly mobile persons are at a lower risk of cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, and diabetes, and its benefits are too diverse to be listed here.
The fineness of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air, sunshine, and fun.
Some people even get new friends when they hunt.
As usual, disgruntled harlots look for things to complain about here.
Yes, someone can walk towards the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there were applications like Fitbit in the past that could monitor activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The novelty will be lost and the use will be reduced in time.
However, due to the success of Pokémon there will be other games that combine applications and virtual reality with the real world's activity, helping many hunters to be more active, in better condition and healthier.

Simone Bales caught gold in a women's gymnastics multi-game.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity court.
Simone Bales is immune to everything.
Energy in jumps.
Swallowing at the boom.
I can't believe it with a permony.
Great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast reached the multi-game championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics’ reflection.
He scored his overall score, 62.198, clearly better than the silver medalist and the final Five teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Alya Mustafina.
Simone Biles in the U.S. Balancing at the finals of the women's multiple match at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman who has won the multi-game championship in a row, and the fifth American champion in all, and at the same time strengthened her reputation for her generation, and perhaps for the best of all time.
He burst into tears when his final score was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement brings him to the same category as the other best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
Bales has ruled his race for the last three years, winning 15 World Championships, including 10 gold, with programmes whose mixture of ambition and accuracy has been so amazing that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I see."
The final test waited in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of excessive expectations.
Returning home to Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
Simone Biles, on the left of the United States, and Aly Raisman hugging after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) at the finals of the women's multiple match in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, August.
Bales reached the first medal on Tuesday when he served as a climax at the launch of the lively national team coordinator, Martha Karoly.
Although Bales claimed that he had never thought about the future as he walked a long way to the top, it is not entirely truthful.
Some of his permanto program, including his trademark's voltio-shit, has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also be ideally suited to the street next to the Rio Olympic arena.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents, and found by Coach Aimee Boorman’s mother when she was on a study trip to the gym where Boorman was coached, has become a force factor.
He has not lost in the multi-game since the summer of 2013, and this victory pipeline will continue for as long as Bales wants.
Even though Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just a delusion.
The balance boom and the perm, where Bales is the world champion, waited.
He rose to the top at the boom points at 15.433 and crossed them by getting 15.933 permanella.
Raisman hugged him well when they were waiting for the final points - just formality - and tears rose to the eyes of Bales with glitter red, white and blue, when the dream he once wrote about in his cutbook became true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of a revantage from four years ago when he was in a divided third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafia in the recurrence.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader that the Americans call "grandmother" was clearly in charge.
He sent flying kisses to the public after his permanent performance in emotional danger a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as Bales is concerned, this 19-year-old's widespread tweet from earlier this week will have a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial murder were shot listening to music in the car
In the most deadly attack in Phoenix's first decade of a serial killer, two women died and a 12-year-old girl sat in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot, as reported in a police release published on Thursday.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis’ daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the road on 12 June.
The press reports that the shooter standing on the passenger side of the car fired up to eight times and then escaped with another vehicle.
According to the police, the triple death did not appear to have been the result of the robbery, for the attacker did not take the handbags or the other adult victim had $2900.
Phoenix Police Representative, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting led the investigators to see if it was connected to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks over four months, mainly in two parts of the Latin American city.
"This is what happens in the residential area in front of the home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS's subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as the brown Nissan in the late 1990s, the black BMW in the late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers have refused to disclose evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are related and made by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of his injuries, where he died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The Witness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police bulletin, which took place only half an hour before the death of the triple, and which was targeted at an empty open van, which is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Researchers found bullet casings, bullet in the seat and bullet fragments in the engine room.
A 6-year-old mother with microcephalia: "Your account is getting easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-headed, which is the result of a genetic disorder his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise anything like this.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund would never learn to recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was, "I didn't know people were still doing it," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with his walking tent.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth will show you how to use the unmarked sign you invented by Edmund to "sing to me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not the usual sign language, he tells me that Edmund has come up with some of his own signs.
Microcephalitis may be due to a number of different causes: genetics, such as Edmund’s case, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I'm just asking what's gonna happen.
What's going to happen?
He still doesn't know.
In fact, I haven't asked for a prognosis in a long time because I don't expect anyone to actually give me one.
But Picciu has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defects due to Zika.
It'll make things easier.
You can believe it'll make things easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
The heavy rain and floods caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi.
The heavy rainfall and widespread floods in Louisiana caused the governor to declare the emergency on Friday, and more rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded over their grains and caused a major flood due to extremely heavy rainfall.
Governor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said that the state authorities are constantly in contact with local authorities and that help is already coming into the districts that need it.
Mike Steele, a representative of the Governor's security and emergency office, said that they would receive requests for water transport, boats and sandfalls.
Steele said that the whole region of Tangihaha was the only one that asked for tens of thousands of sand bags.
The flood guard is in force until Saturday in a large part of the southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in the opinion that a further three to five cents of rain would be expected in the region.
In southern Alabama, the flood guard was in force on Friday as the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana and are predicted to set a flood record during the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood into several houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that there is a threat of flooding the Ascension District along the river, as flooding rivers slowly descend to Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the state border of Mississippi in Liverpool, was on the highest level of all time on Friday morning at 9 a.m.
Saviours are still picking people up from floodwater in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and grandson were close to Gloster on Friday.
62-year-old Hansford says that normally over 400 feet from his house the water of Beaver Creek rose rapidly during the night.
He says that the other half of the boy who lived nearby warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising," Hansford said.
It went all the way to my waist.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she has not seen the water of the stream so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family had injuries and that he was the only swimmer.
Hansford said that the rescue workers saved three in a large army-style truck and took them to Gloster's fire station, where the saved ones stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that the floods are rapidly spreading as heavy rains continue, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that a witness near Livingston reports 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country had been completely fed up with the heavy rain since Wednesday.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets led to the rescue of the residents of Tangihahoa County from their homes and the withdrawal of lessons in five school districts, the authorities told.
CBS’s subsidiary WWL reported that a member of the City Council in Tangihaho said 200 homes were flooded.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, but they are now under flood.
The president of the district, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets who had remained encircled by the tide.
The cities of Amite and Hammond have been protected for those who have been evacuated.
"They can go back to their homes when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the city of Hammond, a few dozen streets were closed in the district of Tangi Evil because of the tide, and the residents were able to pick up sand cubes to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
"The last great flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city administration.
This is becoming a similar case.
Rupert Lacy, the head of emergency in Harrison County, in Mississippi, said that even rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday, a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded, but no floods have been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, director of the Shopper Value Foods, has lived in the region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and the rain continues."
The six-year-old Mahah Brown, full of bullets, survives the shooting of Philadelphia.
The police report that a six - year - old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six - year - old shooting in the city this week.
His grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name is Mahah Brown.
Grandparents say Brown had multiple gunshot wounds, including to the groin, leg, hand, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
At the hospital, the boy’s condition has been recorded as critical and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the station he's expected to recover.
The boy was starting his first grade at a local secondary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were stable according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car together with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
The investigators will inform CBS Philadelphia that it appears that there was a cross between several shooters.
The type of shells that came from various weapons of attack filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a constant struggle.
There were casings on the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
"It seems, therefore, that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were active in the fight," said Anthony Ginaldi, Chief of Police of Philadelphia, who told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and according to the information received, the police are investigating surveillance tapes.
Another six-year-old, a girl, got hit by a delusion on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That is how I call this year's Women's Olympic Gym team, for more than one reason.
Firstly, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Bales, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, will make everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin American women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised me as an Olympic winner, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they present unexpected but masterly gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American woman who has repeatedly won individual gold in a women’s multistudent.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation does not look like this in the gyms around the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all walked the same path Aly and Madison reached the Olympics team.
They are "Final Five" (the last five), because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnastics, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is an expensive type, and gymnastics mainly practice in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for training, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for trainers and their gymnastics and families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous suburban neighbourhoods that can support the species.
In these clubs, gymnasts get all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Bales, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must bring cheaper and available gymnastics training to communities where numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organisation, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15 000 urban youth (mainly black and Latin) and we have trained national and international masters.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide a high level of gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic race.
The gymnastics develop the strength, flexibility, and coordination of the body, as well as the hardness, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination offers life-long benefits for good health and school and work success.
This team's inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and it's great.
Participation in sport is so important, especially for girls.
We're living in an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing a serious "girl's power" by winning the Olympic team ball, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road towards healthy, strong and successful young women.
Doctor interns organising new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff, but 58% of the doctor's trainee who took part in the 37 000 votes rejected it.
In July Hunt revealed plans to force the agreement, saying that NHS was on an unknown soil, and that even minor additional delays harm staff and patients.
The first doctors will be transferred to a new agreement that includes changes in night and weekend working habits in order to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Last night, Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee of Doctors, said in the opinion: "Doctor trainees still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, in particular that it will accelerate the existing labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors equally."
As long as there are only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress must be made and the time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced the government's reluctance to participate and sometimes deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his doors are always open.
"Jeremy Hunt should act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of doctors.
If he does not, doctors will be ready to continue the fight.
The latest strike at the end of April meant a delay of nearly 13,000 routine surgery and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consultants were recruited to serve as a substitute for doctors on strike watch.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54 000 doctors under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to doctors to stop them from going on strike.
Mortimer said, "The fights achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services in a very demanding situation and cause anxiety, anxiety and disturbances for patients, carers and their families."
During the last two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of surveillance (Guardian Role) and the reports (Whistleblowing).
Employers were hopeful that a continuous positive debate on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from the Sabbath leave, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay differences in medicine - would be a sign of the seriousness of employers, the Health Education England training organisation and the Ministry of Health's respect for the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds a day may reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from two pounds a day after the authorities recommended that they be given longer.
A medicine that prevents blood clotting, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of renewable seizures in people with heart disease.
It is already given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another seizure.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to humans for four years in order to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to continue to calculate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140 000 people have a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of them have another seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are due to fatty material accumulated in the wall of the artery, which forms a solid state.
If it breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the circulation of blood to the heart causing a heart attack.
If the clot goes off, it can go with the blood and cut the bloodstream into the brain causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by AstraZeneca, a company in Great Britain and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
The draft NICE guidelines published today recommend that humans be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "In spite of the availability of effective prevention treatments, even a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
Fear of renewal can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When initially recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to add available treatment options to several thousand people who may benefit from them.
As data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular as regards the risk of bleeding, are limited over periods of more than three years, treatment with ticagrelor is not recommended for longer than this period.
A culture of political correctness allows for the flourishing of electoral fraud in Muslim regions
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year because of corruption, giving impetus to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has resulted in the widespread fraud of votes in Muslim communities being ignored, and today's shocking government report reveals.
Former Minister of Government Sir Eric Pickles provides police, electoral supervisors and city councils for ignoring evidence of electoral fraud because of "racial and religious hypersensitivity".
The former Secretary of the Community, the current Emperor of anti-corruption, said that it was so serious to intimidate voters on religious grounds that the police should be allowed to set up guard chains to protect the scared voters outside the polling stations.
He recommends that voters present an identity card when voting to prove who they are.
Today, only a voter must say his name and address.
The report even proposes that an indelible ink be placed on the finger of the voting person so that no one can vote twice.
We should better protect the whistle-trayers, Sir Eric says.
He called on the press to have more access to the documents and decisions of the Board of Governors taken by the informal committees or by the working group.
"This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but would protect local government from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud, which goes hand in hand with the electoral fraud," he said.
The government ordered a report following the voting scandal of the Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court decided that the sitting mayor, Mr Rahman, should be removed from office following numerous charges of corruption and illegal acts.
The Court found Rahman's "creatively distorted" Muslim community's religious feelings and silenced his critic by accusations of racism and Islamic fear.
Rahman is said to have led his election campaign on the basis of the religious obligation of loyal Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were dubious, or the result was that the person would vote in a different way.
Sir Eric said there was false evidence in the whole country.
He expressed particular concern at the post-election vote on the electoral fraud, in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community said that they were pressuring people to vote on the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including proof of identity on the ID card
He said in his report: 'The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote at the will of the elders, especially in those communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that...the state institutions had ignored such conduct due to 'politically correct' racial and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals for cleaning up the system, including a ban on allowing political activists to deal with postal voting tickets so as to stop the "collection of votes".
The report, which Ms Theresa May is looking at, also calls for stricter amendments to the registrations in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options to prove the identity of voters before voting.
Use an indelible ink on the finger of the person voting so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic national checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a limit of three years for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prevent political activists from handling the ready-made voice through the mail and envelopes in which the votes are sent.
Let the police set up security chains around the polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to blame people for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at polling stations.
Require that only English is used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that the staff adheres to the rule that the voter should go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric is running the Great London police force to say it's "astounding" that no criminal charges have been filed since the Tower Hamlets case.
"The electoral court was left behind by Lutfur Rahman and his civil servant as a result of numerous acts of corruption and illegality," he said.
On the basis of a number of reasons, he was found guilty without any doubt, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticised the ineffective "circuit checks" in the electoral offices of city councils.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets sentence was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as the birth of parliaments, but this worrying and mysterious spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Crazy to Kate's cyclists and other famous pictures at the Rio Olympics
This week, the fans at the 2016 Olympics in Rio have gone crazy about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be an impressive double of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic MP is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast of his own famous double being, at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has drawn up a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison, member of the U.S. men's archery team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s double being found on the bicycle track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the star of Leonardo DiCaprio’s twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men’s archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter since his images surfaced, in which he appears to be intimidatingly the same as the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, when he became aware of the passion of social media, the archer admitted that he had heard that he had shown Leo since he was a child.
"I don't see a lot of similarity, except maybe for the beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons in London from 2012 will certainly also emerge this year: the shocking similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina and her obvious eyes have been said to be the double being of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghi has been comparing Glee to Matthew Morrison for years.
Bigger eye shift: This user thinks Nathan is the "sportsman" version of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both with similar strong eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has the same actor as Annalynne McCord's tan skin and pale hair, while the United States team Nathan Adrian reminds its fans of "the sports version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Hard Women: Football Star Hope Solo, Left, and Dexter Actress Jennifer Carpenter, Right, Share the same face shape and eyes
Not only: one Twitter user was very pleased that others saw similarities too
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a couple of similarities
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the website that "other people on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American football star and Dexter actress really have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and his smile, which is almost identical to the actress Laura Linney's smile, as well as the gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, whose own beautiful wide smile matches the smile of the Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
The Olympic Commander of the CBC apologizes after saying the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the 4th-year-old Ai Yanhan's women's 4x200-metre free swimmer, instead of the 14th-year-old Ai Yanhan's, on Wednesday, upset CBC's direct Olympic audience.
The Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize after one of its reporters said during the race a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "has lost the smell of evil" and "dead as a pig".
Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the women’s 4x200 - meter free swimming message final.
MacDonaldi, who came to CBC's reporting team to bring "color", was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China was muttering, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14 swims the message at the second part 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to catch China.
The viewers across Canada react quickly after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer 'has died like a pig?"?
The idiot didn't realize he was still live."
Chinese Ai Yanhan was described as the women's free swimming in the 4x200-metre message final as follows: "That little 14-year-old from China was muttered, baby."
The review against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was heroic and quick, while many challenged him.
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how indifferent Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist group.
Soon thereafter, Scott Russell, who ran the CBC broadcast, apologized live to MacDonald's comment, saying: "We regret that the comment on swimming performance was sent.
We had to complain about the choice of words, we regret that this happened."
CBC decided to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Mr. Scott Russel, the reporter, had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
Then CBC copied and added an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and published a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and sent live.
We quickly took action last night and, on live, we apologized to our viewers and our followers in social media.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and regrettable choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live and tried to define his comment by stating that he did not mean to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize at this moment for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said in the Olympic broadcast at the CBC.
"I referred to the swimmer's performance, not to him as a person."
"It is unnecessary to say that I did not mean it as disrespectful and that I am truly sorry."
Primark's client is stunned by a woman who embellished in her underwear in the middle of the store.
Customers didn't know where to look when a woman took off in the middle of Primark's store to try her underwear.
The fact that, having assessed what she looked like in her pants, she peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and eventually adjusted four underpants in a store located at the Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkeston.
Primark's shop at Bouverie Place's mall in Folkestone, where she put her underwear on and then put them back on the shelf.
At the same time, the mother of two children in the shop, Jenny Davidson, said that after experimenting with underwear, the mysterious woman "redressed and walked out of the store without buying anything".
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took a couple of underwear, undressed her own tights and underwear, and put on her shoes to fit.
"He didn't even try to find a secluded place to make amends, he just stood there in shameless."
"They all stared at me while he was taking off his underwear and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before he finally decided not to like anything he saw, dressed again, and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking of a person who would end up buying underwear that he made up."
A 33-year-old Davidson in Kent's town said, "It's disgusting to think that someone's taking their underwear home, which someone else has tried, but they haven't been cleaned."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I told you that the staff apparently tried to remove the pieces of clothing from the sale after she left, which is fine."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find that another woman put them on and took them off, and they haven't been washed."
Primark's representative said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place at Folkestone's movement on Tuesday 9 August.
All the products in question have been withdrawn from sale."
This will allow you to defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to the New York City Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation, Rhon Mizrach, to find out how to deal with gun-wring robbers at a close distance.
Either in front or behind, this video shows you how you can pay the attacker the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn around so you can see your assailant and clear the line of fire.
Then you grab the gun between your elbow and your shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue with the knee to the groin, and when the attacker goes from pain to pain, pull the gun out of his hands, strike him in the back of the gun, and retreat, holding the gun against him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the weapon and turn it around so that the criminal cannot fire.
At the same time, put weight on the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon from his grip, retreat and point the gun at him.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video on how Mizrachi exactly does this.
But remember, if you're not the grand master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
The British traveler has put a serious challenge on his immune system and on his vomiting reflex by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most obsessive places.
The host from Suffolk and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, licked the euro banknote, the rail in Piccadilly Circus, the wash key for the train toilet and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was in.
However, the experiment, which was made with a film called Internal Power, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the spraying device used by thousands of people may seem completely obnoxious, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On her way across Europe, Wright continued to talk to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening the intestinal bacteria and her own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with any other bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became a well-known tester of the endurance of his intestines as he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task from the public rail stations to the toilet ventilator did indeed test his immune system.
In a movie he said, "Since I was a kid, I've been rather careless about my health, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth, starting with soil, worms and dung water."
He did confirm his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His sample contained over 4,000 units in the photometer.
For comparison purposes, the reading of the opposite hands should be less than 60.
But in a public toilet in Russia, he refused to lick when the result of the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the opposite hand was less than 60.
Wright has produced a tourist’s film, the trail of inner strength, together with the Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything 'cause there's something to eat in here.
After inner strength, the Finnish dairy, Valio, was produced together.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, which help to enhance people’s intestinal bacteria and immune systems.
Niko Vuorenmaa, head of snacks, juice and new categories of Valio, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the interests of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up with the idea of "let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary picture we can tell consumers more about it in an interesting way.
I also think the document shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The documentary director Tom Hakala added: "Let's say this now: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him, like the night-old Russian toilet shown in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of the licking things were easier for Ian, while others were rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows recorded."
In a survey carried out in 2015, 84% of respondents combined lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the abdomen and intestine, and 58% said that at least sometimes they use products with added lactic acid bacteria.
The belt family destroyed the rental house at Cornwall's Saltash, before he left town.
The belt family caused 50 000 pounds of damage to their rental house after they were deported for terrorizing their neighbours.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after being complained about several times.
After being forcefully removed from the property, the employees of the upset housing company found that the property was in a bad condition.
The walls were filled with bulging holes, the floor boards were torn, the waste was spread to the floor, and the walls were buried with graffiti.
The family has now moved and they are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the manager of Cornwall Houston, said she was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said: "This has been a nightmare for the inhabitants, and I do not think that people should have to live like this.
There are many things to consider here, as this property is likely to be known through less comfortable groups of Cornwall.
This family is infamous, and their names are infamous."
The couple had three boys who sometimes lived in a real estate, and the police say that family terror contained street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of close residents, drug abuse, drug sales, and excessive screaming, quarreling, and cursing.
In June, Skeldon, 47 years old, whose name was in the lease, received a decision on non-social behaviour.
Many of the rooms in the house under the threat of disintegration found old waste.
The properties from which drugs have been used in the past had been pulled up.
The neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street and that the police were called regularly.
Cornwall Houston forcefully removed a woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks, to change the time voluntarily.
Easier neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become one hell.
Someone said, "They didn't care about anybody."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here incredibly many times.
"This morning, we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here, we're not used to it!
I love it now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, Executive Director of Cornwall Houston, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the property.
Trash and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the rental house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his own behaviour and for the conduct of his family, for eviction is always the last procedure considered by Cornwall Houston.
This was a very difficult case, for behavior was extreme, and their actions must have terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate everything the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the brave members of the community who informed us.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to our neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys were all living in the property at different times, but they were all in the 20s.
After the wedding, a dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom
The workers of the housing company now have to clean the wastes surrounding the house
In 2014, the police raided the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis as well as balance, supplies and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined for his guilt for possession of a class b drug as a plan to pass it on.
He claimed that the money was meant for the tombstone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partners live homeless after being frozen in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house's rooms had been mutilated with graffiti.
The police say they're trying to get rid of the residents who are mocking the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police said that eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who would continue to mock the rules.
"This is a message for those who think that their conduct is without sanctions, and for those who suffer from such behaviour," he said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew down the beach.
Sun - worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced the shock of their lives
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane would wipe by really low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
Right now, horrified tourists began to panic when a low - flying jet wiped over a full beach.
Dramatic recording shows how the military plane came almost to touch the sun’s servants on the sand lane in Aveiro, North Portugal.
The holidayers stood up when, understandably, they began to worry about the noise from the jet, even though they did not at first see what was coming toward them from behind the clouds.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the many holidayers who published videos of a dramatic bypass in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It passed twice really low, and one point seemed like it was going to crash into the ground."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and really felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane appeared out of darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast and had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown considerably lower than usual because of the bad visibility caused by the smoke from nearby areas, but the air force assured that nobody’s safety was in danger.
This summer, land fires have destroyed parts of continental Portugal, and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
Today, the Portuguese Air Force said that the pilot had to fly due to low visibility conditions, smoke from the ground areas and thick fog.
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats.
Excite the result of the first half of the year better than expected
The Social and Health District of South Karelia (Eksote) achieved a better result than planned in January-June.
The result of the extremism was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where preventive services have been developed to help defuse institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, the Exote aims to shorten the sequences of measures.
The extremism covers the deficit previously incurred by the surplus.
The remaining part may be used to shorten queues and to buy measures for patients.
The result of the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Government will discuss the six-monthly review at its meeting next Wednesday.
Seventy Special Borders Jägers swore a military whale in Immola
Of the 70 guards at the border and maritime security schools, they swore a military oath on Friday.
A military election was held in Immola on Friday.
The Tenth Special Border Jäger Course whale was held in the army’s sports field.
The military oath was sworn by 70 backup men.
Special border guards are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special border ice-cream.
They were invited to the selection tests of 250 of them.
Special border icers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans from the border forces during the war were involved in the assembly of the veterans.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans took part in the event were born in 1918.
A lot of looters ahead of us - criminal intelligence helps solve crime and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 police departments in Finland has been an RTA unit, i.e. a criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible outwards.
At Häme police station, the unit consists of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's towed by a sergeant stationed in Lahti.
The Chief Chief of Staff is Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and need, see Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various reports to the other police.
Among other things, it has obtained information from asylum seekers.
Recent work practices reform
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police working practices.
The aim was to prevent crime, which means that the police would not go to the mouths until they received the alarm.
The information collected and analysed by the Unit is used to target daily police activities where it is needed most.
With the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre was set up in the country, with less than three national units, and a criminal intelligence unit for each police station.
The PTR centre in Vantaa, in connection with the Central Criminal Police, manages the activities nationally.
In PTR units, people from the police, Customs and Border Guard.
RTAs, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police agencies and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond its territory
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to the RTA unit to know what is going on throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the borders of its own institution, because crime does.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
Through registers, an alert mission database and observations, the unit is seeking to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialisation, and it is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it's honest or criminal.
Based on the method of action, the author is a certain kind of image.
The selection can be done on the basis of an act or person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not carry the collars up in the city, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by criminals, as well as their own, are not reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities, thereby preventing police crime prevention attempts.
The police report on the methods publicly if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
For example, this case was reported from the beginning of the summer, the method of marking empty dwellings used in housebreaks.
It was where the authors put the external door stick, the second needle, or a tape piece that they were trying to see if the residents were really travelling.
The preliminary investigation material shall be public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals are learning from the mistakes they have made.
The smartest order the district court protocol, for example, which shows that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time, they're going to steal gloves in their hands.
Deputy Police Commissioner Tero Seppus from Hämee Police Department, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Department, Detective Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Crime Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police Department.
The police collect and analyse information to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in labour and financial resources.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside its own institution and Finland's borders.
A schoolgirl who joined fathers in London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the Isis, is rumored to have died in Syria.
A lawyer named Tasname Akunjee said that the girl's family heard her dead in the Syrian Raqqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian air strike at Raqqa, a base for the organization in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she was planning a escape from a war-treated country and returning to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and a will to others, that there are real risks of leaving the war zone - that it could cause people to give up making such a decision," said Akunyee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other Eastern Italian schoolgirls flew to Turkey, where they took the bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she had married an Isis fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow only after a few months.
Reid says Clinton will consider Garland the Supreme Court candidate if he is elected.
President-in-Office of the Senate, Harry Reid, says that he is convinced that Mr Hillary Clinton will be appointed to the Supreme Court of Judge Merrick Garland if he is elected President.
The Senate Republicans have prevented Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Mr McConnell, head of the majority of the Senate, says that the next President will elect the person who has passed to replace Mr. Antoni Scalia.
On Thursday, at the telephone conference, Reid said that he would predict, with some degree of certainty, that Clinton would choose Garland.
Mr Reid's representative later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton as to whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He complimented Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "wring a boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans that hinder Garland's appointment are the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "daughters" and "opportunists".
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treats says the nude calendar is for women as well as for men.
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pirrell in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked fames, they intend to find the next top-of-the-line generation in their 2017 NU Mus calendar.
Steve Shaw, President of the Treats, told us earlier this year that his magazine, which contains a lot of naked photos, is different from the old school playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he thinks that the calendar is for them too.
"We must start to introduce the timeless and classic nakedness where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these naked images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release where the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful art.
Models can leave pictures online or in personal open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: who actually buys records?
Solo, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you rush to fill in the comment with irritable insults, written by the NoAll IndividualsMen of Middle Ages, you will find that this argument is based on real information.
According to YouGov, the new arrival of much-spoken albums is not because more and more people born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but about the spell of the Middle Ages.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl plate are most likely 45-54 years old.
In fact, all those who are most likely to buy records are among the age group aged 18-24.
It is also not just a question of collecting a hobby, but it includes emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings within themselves (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But is the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me when I'm walking in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I'd be very busy before I stop, forming a cup of my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's look at this more closely."
Let's take a closer look at this.
At the same time as Soho's charm and dirt are being slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops, as well as office supplies are now filled with buildings where there were previously independent movements - a handful of magnificent specialised record shops are still left.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for the moment when I stand very close to different men in some of these shops trying to assess their age and emotional temple.
Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably twenty), spends his afternoon in London for a meeting and tours shops to spend a few hours.
I'm gonna ask him if he's a collector.
"I'm sure," he says.
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, which appear in the picture above (sent the sample by e-mail, did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for obtaining such a huge amount of disks and singles is partly the result of his disposable income: now he can buy discs that he could not afford when they were originally published, and he can buy back those he sold when he was young and broke.
"A large part of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early '70s, records published when there were 11 or 12, which I was probably a little too young to get," he says.
He agrees that the buyers of the discs are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company and adds: "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my bad."
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets fit youGov's profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by media enthusiasm. People who have heard that the records have returned to fashion and who have had the need to buy back their old records.
On the basis of the discussions I have been discussing, people have been getting rid of their collection in general in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs now sell their cds to buy their CDs back," he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl awakeners of certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of the records?
In a trade such as Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer comfort to similar types of community.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the local payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be confused with the digital world and choose to trust the permanence of familiar album covers; objects that raise the memories of the happy days of teen life.
"I think it may sometimes be about filling a hole or some kind of comfort to own the objects," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe that it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" the other employee suddenly said from a pile of records.
The opinion poll carried out by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought a vinyl plate in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a disc player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyls have no disc player.
This is where the news report is likely to look seriously concerned while browsing the stack of bossa nova collections.
This "winning" perspective of the awakening is something that Jonny, 42, who also works at the Sounds of the Universe (the counter: three middle-aged men), has noticed.
"Somebody came in a while ago and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a radiohead album so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
It is not a large part, but it is absolutely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So it's not parents, it's younger people, people my late age, who are just getting excited.
In the Fopp, which now has almost a whole layer reserved for vinyls, there is a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventy-six couples, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previous moves, the loudspeakers are excavated by Wild Beast's latest scapegoat and sex-enhanced pop, and it's not improvisation jazz - it's great to see different customers.
None of them seem very lonely, but it is difficult to prove a fading psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes watching various records on sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make a lot of money, so recording is not really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either by computer or something else, but the beauty of vinyl is..." he sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to look like I'm looking at cocksuckers, I'm picking up a group of teenage girls gathering around Polaroid cameras for a while before their father and daughter are thinking about buying Crosley's CD player.
On the left there is a stairwell with a wall covered with the records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of modern music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one looks at them - maybe because they're just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's purely art vinyls.
But given that even a little attention from these objects can mean more money to industry and send some customers to Soho's shells to pick up more, there is not much to complain about.
It will not come as a surprise that the part of the population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury materials, such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that youGov's results are correct at least in Soho's record stores, they do not rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record shops and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or at the office.
They really don't spend their Thursday mornings playing around Berwick Street's record stores, browsing records and avoiding the eyes of a creepy 30-year-old artificial television drunk who's looking over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker is the longest living vertebrate animal in the world - video report
Researchers say that the holocaust has a longer life span than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied sharks, says that the record is on a female who is believed to be 272 to 512 years of age and is five metres long.
The French court rejects the application for the withdrawal of trade from Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected the Calais authorities' request for tens of temporary shops and restaurants in Jungle's camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court proceedings this week, the Calais authorities argued that the State should be able to break down 72 temporary shops, where people sell goods from cigarettes inside the camp to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea by 50 cents (40 pence), or sell simple food by a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect's Office argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent a tax-free parallel economy and are a risk of fire and cleaning.
The humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by a state-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
The Court of Justice in Lille ruled that there were no legitimate grounds for eviction of 72 people who were engaged in temporary trade, but said that Calais's prefect's concern was "excellently understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than feeding only "the people living in extremely uncertain conditions".
He said that the facilities offered peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the landing threat was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, whose activities are unprofitable and which offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children’s cafe.
The letter sent to the Guardian said that closing the café would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.
Two charities, Help Refuges and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle's camp has risen to 9000 people - the peak number - after the sharp increase in the number of arrivals during the summer.
Food prices in Finland fall clearly faster than in the EU average
Food is greatly cheaper in Finland to the satisfaction of consumers and to the detriment of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by almost five per cent in three years, compared to 0.9 per cent on average in the EU countries.
At the same time, food has become 1% more expensive in Germany and Sweden.
In the last three years, food prices have decreased most in Finland from those EU countries with a level of pay similar to that in Finland.
In Britain alone, food prices have fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are reflected in the article by Ilkka Lehtinen, Development Manager of Statistics Finland, published in Tieto & Trends blog.
The magazine compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June of this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then followed a turn, after which food has become cheaper year after year.
The price is now under pressure from Russia's bans on food imports, which have eliminated food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition between industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in price.
The large trade chains S-Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
Price competition has appeared to the consumer as prominent advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not the place for affordable food, although the price of food has fallen greatly.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with similar wage levels to Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the comparative countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar levels of pay.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the comparative countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to get to the old EU countries at food prices, we need to split VAT to the average level of the EU countries and continue to compete in prices", Lehtinen writes.
The Lehtinen notes that the calculations he has made at the rate of VAT are indicative.
School isn't quite the same anymore.
The person returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all lower schools.
It is a guide that works in all schools in Finland.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells us the official objectives.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old ones in many ways.
Among other things, the study of beauty writing is abandoned, and schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education starts in sixth grade at the latest, and social education starts in fourth grade.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that the teacher was teaching the students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
This is how you try to make school more interesting.
The tallest vertebrae in the world was found - an ice shark can live for up to 400 years
The Greenland halibut (Somniosus microcephalus) known as the icy is only 150 years old.
It can live after 250 years, reports a new study.
The figures make the species the longest vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal, it is only passed by an Icelandic imposter whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507.
Greenland's sharks are swimming down the North Atlantic.
They also hold a second record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
Females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to a height of over five metres.
Because the rate of growth is slow, according to the results, only about one inch [9 cm] a year, adult individuals have lived hard for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen, along with his colleagues, found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks of 28 females who had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon dating of the eye lenses.
The mean age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 cm and 502 cm, were exposed to approximately 335 and 392 years of age.
Since previous studies have shown that the ice sharks only reach sexual maturity in more than four metres, researchers calculated that they were about 150 years old at that time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockman fires almost 300 people - salesmen are not reduced
Almost 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann.
Cooperative companies in a firm in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the match, approximately 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will take the form of layoffs," says Stockmann in his release.
According to it, the number of sellers in the goods sector will not be reduced in order to avoid suffering from customer service.
In addition, around 80 workers in support activities are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann's yt-negotiations concerned some 3,000 workers.
At the start of these, it was estimated that there would be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population aims to achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are due to take place next year.
In the past, Stockmann has launched an efficiency programme designed to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
In the background, Stockmann’s difficulties in making the goods store profitable.
Although the adjusted operating result of the group improved to EUR 11,1 million in the second quarter, the trade in goods still makes a loss.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, Stockmann’s See CEO, sales in the department of goods have not reached the objectives set by the company.
"Unfortunately, staff reductions are necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail has a positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen states in the release.
The result improvement in the second quarter was particularly due to the good success of the chain of clothing Lindex.
Ketju achieved the best sales and results in the second quarter of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s operating result was 4.1 million in losses.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year are shrinking from last year.
The corrected operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees throughout the country
The centre of low pressure on the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rain on Friday, says Ilona Lag, the meteorologist of HS.
There will also be rainfalls in the middle of the country, but the south is the vertebrates.
The temperature is no longer very summer, for the whole country is under 20 degrees of mercury.
In the northern rainy areas, 10-15 degrees are left.
Kenya’s sports team is shaken by a strange explanation of the doping scandal - coach’s pace
The Kenyan sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah was a national team athlete in the doping test.
The news agency AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is a 800 - meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, one of Kenya’s national team leaders, reported that Anzrah’s identity was revealed after he gave a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials came to inform the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he "has committed a crime against Kenya's country team".
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the papers.
We cannot accept such use," Mr Kip Keino, President of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, in turn, told the news agency Reuters.
The Olympics' sport starts on Friday, and Rotich is due to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was ranked fourth in the World Cup last year and has premiered Rio’s winning favorites.
According to Reuters, the source inside the Kenyan sports team claimed that Anzrah was only on the athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the village.
When the antidoping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to a test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid he'd be exposed," the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio's general sport studio is evaporating its emptyness.
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching sports.
In Rio, on Friday, the battle for sports medals began, but the world’s top individuals were able to present their skills to a confusingly empty scene.
Rio’s organizers reported on Friday that only 58 percent of the first day’s morning tickets and 65 percent of the evening’s tickets have been sold.
It was four years ago in London, where the stadium bullied the cheering crowd.
The finale tickets are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympics' loss has attracted attention even before sport.
For example, thousands of empty seats have been seen in the sights of rugby, melon, and riding.
When Brazil’s medalist brains Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the scene was full.
After the Brazilian twin, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the 12,000 were full.
The bad move is at least explained by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic races are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
True, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not have filled the football stadium.
The publicist Mario Andrada told this weekend that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There is still 1.1 million left to sell," said Andrada, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million flags of the London Olympic Games, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost almost half as much as Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around nine euros to over a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than EUR 16.
At the Summer Olympics in London, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but this is not yet allowed in Rio because the organisers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
True, in Rio, organisers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for less well - known species, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty places at the Rio Stadium this morning.
Even on the sands of Copacabana, there's no interest in the public.
Jukka Keskalo competed in London 2012.
I've had enough of the people in the gallery.
New way to protect nature - get a right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
The foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant natural sites.
After that, private, companies and entities can redeem the rights of holders of land with money.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is divided virtually into blocks which the people who wish to acquire against the payment of the right of the holder.
The holder is entitled to veto in its 187 square blocks, which in practice means that no approval by each holder is required if the use of the land is to be changed.
You can also acquire custody rights for several blocks.
Acquisition of the right of administration is something concrete that can be left for inheritance or given as a gift.
You don't have to go carrying banners or chaining yourself up to protect nature," Juha Levíkana, who acquired the right to control the company, justifies.
The holder of the administrative right receives accurate location information from his block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation's website, the names of the holders of the rights are available on the same map as the block data of the land.
The only risk that the work of the Foundation will change from its original idea is that of the Levivate.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest with the aim of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would somehow operate in an ethical or commercial manner, but it should not be possible.
The core idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Holder project is the conservation of natural areas so that they can be intact and in peace.
The Foundation will acquire land either by buying or by making a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of the rights of holders, but the Foundation has obtained its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also targets outside Finnish borders and plans to land in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in pop-up forest at Helsinki Market Square from 13 to 19 August.
Wheel thieves torture Turku the worst of the big cities - see the situation of your municipality
Cycling thieves torture Turku the worst of Finland’s major cities.
This year, more wheels have been stolen in proportion to the population than in the nine other major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat explained to the police the number of bicycles and parts of bicycles stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August of this year, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, there were four to five bike thieves per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, only about two bicycle thieves per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities, double the number of thefts are carried out in proportion to the population," describes Police Inspector Tommi Reen.
Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of threats can be influenced by the number of wheels in the city and the number of wheels in the city at all," says Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen, the police government, will have to expect Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts goes largely according to the number of study and cycling cities.
Turku has a tight center, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
For example, Espoo is a different type of city, where city centres are far apart and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of movement," Reen says.
In all Finland, the police have become aware of slightly less wheel thefts in January to August than in the corresponding period of last year.
Still, there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police report a little more than 20,000 bicycle thefts every year.
It means 50-60 fillers every day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 bikes per year.
"They're big," Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more wheels, for only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to file a report on a bike theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police will be resolved.
Typically solved bike theft is where the police get information about the theft right away and the thief gets caught in blood.
"Even in other investigations, cases can be discovered when, for example, in a drug case, a stolen wheel can be found in the apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the work itself or in police investigations, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, wheels are stolen, for example, from the shopping center’s wheel racks, courtyards, warehouses and cellars, i.e. practically everywhere they are stored.
As in previous years, Jopo is the biggest thief of individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the wheel better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take the bike, for example, for their own short - term use, but a large part of the stolen wheels end up for sale, for example, online.
They stay on the domestic market.
"At least the police didn't find out that stolen wheels would go a lot abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, shoppers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
I'm sure some of them will buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some might have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful as he or she may be guilty of a cover-up or infringement.
"The alarm clocks should ring if a good-quality bike is sold at a clear lower price," Reen says.
Severi, a special library official, carries his colorful Nops for his working day to protect Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He's had five bikes, but no one's been stolen, says the deer. "Never been taken, there's been a good monk."
"This may not be so attractive to thieves, but this may not even have a hipster value," says the H.E.
Siuni Valve, who was a quick customer of the kiosk in Kallio in Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now, the bike is down against the wall, but usually Valve is locking his bike in a solid, like a wheel rack.
"There will be a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I have to own," says the Helsinki student on his white bike, whose body alone cost about five hundred euros.
"The whole time you've heard guys say you've taken the wheels."
"Mostly bad wheels, such scum jocks."
The bike was stolen from the building company's inner yard a year ago.
But the bike had not been locked, so the Watch had been waiting to catch it.
Under the age of 15 responsible for his crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-reviewing teams from the United States
In Helsinki, the so - called peer pressure is being tried to prevent young people from getting into the cycle of crime.
At first, the experiment applies to persons under 15 years of age who are now deprived of criminal liability.
The peer board is involved in the first young man's crime.
The idea is that the peer review team will discuss what happened with the offender and impose sanctions.
A week later, the offender himself can join the peer board to make up for his actions.
For example, a letter to the family explaining what has become done and what has been learned from it can have other consequences.
Tommi Laatio, Director of Youth, tells us that the model is not strict.
We also have other forms of mediation that are used in parallel.
"All are guided in a more responsible direction so that everything does not get ruined by the first mistake," says the Department.
A model of the United States has been taken into account for the peer review team, where it is widely used.
The idea is that, after his first crime, a young person does not have to face an adult panel, but reflects what happened to approximately the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service designer Iikka Lovio of Palmu, who followed the trial, reports that it was an abuse that was successfully resolved.
In particular, the first crimes committed by persons under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It has been a message to continue in the way you choose," says Lovio.
The peer-review team is part of the Helsinki project of the Finnish Immigration Service, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new approaches are being offered to all those in need, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop financing Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was published by Politico, a United States magazine that had received a draft of it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money transferred to the Congressional elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his lack of concern, incompetence and record disapprovals, threaten to bring a sound stream to the Democrats in these elections," says Politico.
Only the immediate targeting of all possible funds to the Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in their necks with a Trump-engraved anchor.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election will fall day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons who organized the letter is apparently Andrew Weinstein, a Republican opposed to Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security stated in an open letter that they did not support Donald Trump as President.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States
In the United States, President Hillary Clinton told about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be president, so that the US economy can do well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy can go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve US infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would partly be financed through increased taxes for the rich, partly through private money.
The building program is a handhold for American dunars who suffer as factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the greatest investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We are a builder nation, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday he sounded like Sanders, stressing that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it's got to pay the starting tax, says Clinton.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"As President, I am opposed to any trade agreement that acts against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticise the financial programme published by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday for "only favouring millionaires of this kind".
The tax deduction proposed by Trump for corporate tax has previously been called "Trump loophole" by Clinton.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was himself the daughter of a small entrepreneur.
He reminded the audience of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of clothes that Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start making his own products in America," Clinton poke.
These are Rio ratings: The competitions have not glued Finns to the squares, but the mobile app is interesting
Typically, sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached extreme numbers.
At one time, 12 per cent of the population have been glued to the squares: on Tuesday night swimming was followed by 615 000 viewers from Yle Olympics channel TV2 at the same time.
As a result of the comparison, almost 800 000 viewers were invited to the TV2 event at the end of the month, and quite a million other players were invited to the EM competitions at football.
The Olympics have so far been most interested in Sunday night cycling and the fifth day of the race was opened by the quay, both of which reached almost half a million viewers at a time on the Olympic Channel.
Panu Pokkinen, Chief of Sports, is pleased with the ratings and recalls that the audiences will be divided into several instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games in Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV audience will choose the Olympic Games in general.
On the television side, the viewers share TV2 and Yle Fem.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions Yle has dedicated an entire channel to.
When the shipment arrives 24 hours a day, and all that time, from 20,000 to 500 000, it is a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's race broadcasts will be in Finland during the night.
Another reason for the shy interest - if someone thinks it is now weak - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken one of the surprise medals from the opening games, the interest would have gone up with it.
In addition, sport is only about to begin, as are other species of interest to Finns: sailing and horse riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of viewers at the beginning has been close to what was expected.
When the sports begin, the audience will explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 Mobile app for the Games, which in the first days of the Games rose to the Apple App Store for the most free app in Finland.
By Monday, the app was loaded 150 000 times.
I'd say we're about to go for 200,000 downloads.
"We don't get the numbers of the network until later," says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not acted as desired for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and that the errors have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been accompanied by a delay and other small technical problems in the early stages.
Applications have been updated to correct errors.
The Rio Olympics will be seen in the Yle Canal and the arena more widely than any other sports event ever before.
Some species can be watched from the Yle Fem channel, and Yle Põe broadcasts games daily on the radio.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the laboriest for Yle at any time, but also the last ones that can only be followed from the channels of Yle.
As of 2018, Olympic sports will be seen on Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is the Sun, whose depth is 95.3 metres on the Crossback.
It may be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical training teacher, found a 20 - square - foot [20 sq m] printing press on the crossback, the bottom of which was shown by a diving computer to be 104 metres deep.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre attempted to confirm the observation by means of a suction.
The method may not find a small depth in 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
More than 80 metres [80 m] from Saimaa, Reisvesi and Main Lake.
They have not been studied as closely as the Sun.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be some unknown depths," Kannela wonders.
If the deepest lake is determined by the centre depth, it is the Great Lake Juka, 23 meters.
From this point of view, your Sun will not enter the ten deepest, and the Suvasvesi is still further from the top.
Correction on August 12th at 14.29: The corrected last paragraph, where the deepest lakes were wrong.
A Fascinating tax sector: The taxation of pensioners continues to tighten up
The taxation of pensioners remains tighter than those of employees.
Ihalainen says that the malpractice appeared under the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to employees.
This is not included in the Government's proposal.
We believe that it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners experienced income reductions that ease taxation.
The matter heated up the opposition representatives in the parliament, who, at the time, polished the Finance Minister Alexander Stubb (see) of the electoral promises.
The purchasing power will be secured, it will not grow
According to the Minister of Finance, Petteri Orpo (see above), tax reductions are mainly about securing and not increasing purchasing power, as next year's wages will not be increased.
He says that tax reductions will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) and Orpo's desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached.
He says that holding to the treaty is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done by the social partners, so it must not be questioned.
It is necessary because the economy is so dependent on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
In a case of persistent unemployment
The Ihanian appeals to the government that it would take long-term unemployment in the budget line, at least to stop its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed persons was approximately 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of persistent unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims in the attacks in Thailand
In the bombings last night and last night in Thailand, at least four people died.
The embassy calls on Finnish residents to be alert and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the guidance of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to go to Thailand should not withdraw because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions should be carefully followed, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The period of travel by Finnish residents to Thailand dates from the end of the year.
The vast majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook since the bombings.
The embassy has tried to reach out to the Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to learn about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be well, says Westphalen.
Not known
According to Westphalen, we don't know who did this yet.
The Ambassador believes that events may relate to the political unrest of a divided society in Thailand and last week's referendum on the Constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law was passed by referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who declared themselves against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, there is a ethnic-national conflict involving the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, previous attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, says Westphalen.
According to him, the city celebrates Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The impact would affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai Police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also excluded, says Thai police according to AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died in 24 hours when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as Phuket and Hua Hin, a popular tourist.
Even in a tourist destination popular with Finns, the holiday island Phuket exploded four bombs in the night, reports the Thai magazine Bangkok Post.
According to the current data, they did not require death victims.
Two of the bombs went off in the newspaper at Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the newspaper.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded in the popular tourist destination in Hua Hin yesterday and today.
At least one of them died in both double-bombs.
In addition, in South Thailand, at the village of Surat Than and in the city of Trang, at least one bomb exploded.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to travel to Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday islands.
No known impactor
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the Thai military junta, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We're not supposed to make people panic any more, he told the reporters.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister for Security Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the purpose of the authors was to destroy tourism in the country, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on Finnish residents to be alert and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to go to Thailand should not withdraw their journey because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions should be carefully followed, says Westphalen.
In wounded Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the night of Finland and their victims.
The attack last night in Hua Hin has had a little bit more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
The wounded include at least Germans, Italians, Dutchers and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in the second attack by Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded in the vicinity of a bell tower known as visibility.
Thai PBS says the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin where they think they've found another bomb.
According to the Governor of the Province, Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower box.
The municipal employee died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded about half an hour apart.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The United States Party won the Women's Square
Alexandra Raisman was the second point 60.098 and Alija Mustafina was the third point at 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still in the Rio Championships for ships with perman, jump and boom.
Bales has controlled women’s gymnastics to an extent for the past few years.
He's got eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-game and permanto championships three times in a row, as well as the boom last and the second year.
In the United States team, Bales has reached two world championships.
The Biles have a jump and a boom.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "The person has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs the real estate agency and the children’s play club in the same property in Phuket, is not concerned about the impact of the bombings in Thailand on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not believe that this will result in anything more wonderful, evaluates Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia, who has worked for about 20 years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of the tragedy that has been experienced in Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then there was a bird flu and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these have not banished the tourists in the past, I don't think this is going to happen.
The office of the Huovila company is located a few hundred meters from the location of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called at about 9 p.m. in local time and said that it was no use coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's festival in Thailand.
Patong had a calm atmosphere, and the main street movements were allowed to open around 10:00 local time.
Many had never even heard of attacks on the beach.
At half past three o’clock, Thailand’s time in Patong was normalized, and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the strike, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila at the scene of the attack.
Later that car was seen in the Kruunupy in Jouxholmie.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol detected two men matching the distinguishing signs hiding in a nearby six.
The other guy got caught right away.
The other one ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of stealing a motor vehicle, theft and gross damage.
The police thank the people who tipped them off.
Research Director on Russia's leadership changes: Clear deportation
On Friday, Russia made the highest change of leadership in the years when President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov, the head of his regime.
Ivanov's successor is a 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's an ex- diplomat and worked as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that Ivanov’s dismissal may be due to Putin’s desire to prevent the strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building up powers independent of the President.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in a relationship with other executives or screwed up.
Drop to Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin’s inner circle, will be transferred to specific environmental and transport tasks.
With the tape put forward by the state media, Putin called the change a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to another assignment and suggested that Heavy replace him, said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear drop in the position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russia's rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but became president of Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old map, such as the governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Katri Pynnöniemi, an older researcher from the Institute for Foreign Policy, says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s place that Putin should switch to a younger neighborhood.
Isis fighters used civilians as human shields when they retreated from Syria.
They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to the city of Jarabulus, so that we would not target them, Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council, said.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters received some 90% of the important city of Manbij.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists stayed in the city at that time.
Adjusted earlier news at 7:30: Earlier, we told wrongly that civilians were running from the city, in fact, the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's public policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on the publicity of documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells the STT that the publication of documents cannot be based on the authority's own policies but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the Minister of Interior’s events to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with the guidance of the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Ministry's Communication Director tells the STT that the Ministry has noted the need to reform practices.
Usai Bolt's final Olympic show begins in Rio
As in the last few years, Bolt's been running against time under the value fairs.
He hurt his way back from the early season and had to skip the Olympics in Jamaica.
This has not been perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, and Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included small - dressed samba dancers and fans.
The bottom line around Poriina Bolt is that the Jamaican star has risen during a period when sport has been struggling with doping scandals and skating interest.
Bolt’s previous defeat at the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he was cut off at the beginning of 200 metres at 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that was slowed down by injuries and loose training.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a time of 100 metres, with which he crushed the world record and his competitors ’ confidence in the final event of 9.69 C.E.
It's harder than that.
One year later, in the Berlin World Cup, Bolt achieved his career by measuring the point of law.
World record in Berlin is still valid at 9.58 a.m. and at 19.19 a.m.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is pursuing a 200 - meter world record and a 19 - second understatement, but no one believes in its creation except Bolt himself.
In Satase, Bolt's great challenger is Justin Gatlin, the winner of the 2004 Olympics in Athens.
Last year at the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredths of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has never lost a single time in the finals of the value fairs, if only he has made his way.
In December 2011, the 100th World Cup final was missed by Bolt because of the fraudulent departure.
Bolt will be up to 30 in a week or so.
He's an old man of young men, and Rio's competitions are his last Olympics.
Bolt will be the last goal of the career next year in London.
These are the Olympics that separate me from each other.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago at an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Detections of Rio: Two athletes suspected of a doping offence
According to Xinhua, a Chinese swimmer named Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyin found traces of banned substances on the doping sample.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping offence.
In addition, the Kenyan sports coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given me a doping sample showing signs of epo hormone.
He was ranked fourth in Rio in the women's 100-metre butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estato, the Chinese swimmer has taken its doping case to the International Court of Appeal CAS.
Xinhua tells us that the sample Xinyi gave on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo hormone.
Kenya, in turn, has sent a sports coach from Rio home for a doping attack.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK reported that the Kenyan coach had become an athlete in the test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, we're talking about a Chinese fast-run coach, John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the Ferguson Rotich race pass of 800 meters in the situation.
Phelps can't be stopped by anything. Historical gold came in a play style.
The most successful athlete in the history of the Olympics, Michael Phelps, swimming in a 200 - meter mix of 22nd Olympics in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach the same species’s Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive competitions.
Phelps' payout was 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino was placed in confusion second before China Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun. Helen Skelton, the BBC Olympic swimming commentator, laughs at the evening magazine's quick interview.
The case of Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read in the evening magazine website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton is not much of a stress if there is a slight noise in the Som or British press about his revealing and special outfits.
I mean, television's a visual media, he's stressing.
Skelton is dressed in high-level shoes and a short dress that certainly has at least enough exposure to the eyes of at least a number of conservative British soys.
There are, however, no back steps.
It's important to look good, and small judges are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to upset you and perhaps startle you, but he insists that you don't want to be in the lead.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter that much how I dress.
Can you imagine the court has reached all the way to Finland?
I can't, but everything that's paying attention to how much these swimmers are doing and how much they're making sacrifices is okay with me, Skelton's grinning.
You know what?
It's a shock from nothing if it comes from the dress of the driver.
I'm a little amused if this thing has hit someone's radar.
The Rio Police Department made two arrests for a terrorist suspicion.
On Thursday, the Rio police reported that they have arrested two people because of a suspected terrorist attack.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the Games.
In the same context, five other arrests were made and two people were questioned before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group as those arrested by the police in July.
The arrested are believed to have connections with the Isis Extremities Organisation.
The detainees were known to have been inciting violence in social media.
Messages calling for violence had been disseminated, among other things, through their recommendations in the WhatsApp.
85,000 police are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
The police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their match in the empty hall in the early part of the Rio basketball tournament on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package of basketball arenas and closed the place down from the audience.
The police let the public in after the controlled explosion of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that the police have carried out a controlled explosion mission.
The police closed down the arena because of the suspicious package found there.
The crowd got in after the police had controlledly blown up the package.
The audience did not record to the audience by the start of the match because the police closed the arena because of the suspicious package found in the hall.
The police didn't blow up the package until after they let the public in.
The drink woke up the Spanish team that started the competition in a dreamy fashion.
Spain, starting with two losses, won Nigerian points 96-87.
In the previous two races, Spain achieved silver.
For the third time during the Rio Summer Games, the police have already carried out a controlled explosion mission.
Last time, the police had to blow up a suspicious discovery near a roadside target last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their match in front of empty views in the early part of the Rio basketball tournament.
The Argentine lady was poking on Petaja-Siren - a Finnish citizen was thinking of protesting
The wind on Petaja-Siren had a colorful day in Rio.
The wind in Petjajah-Sir went through a lot on Thursday.
The Argentinan lady was poking Tuuli Petaja-Siren in Rio on Thursday at the opening of the women's surf day.
There was a clear breach of the wind.
The opponent admitted an offence.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away, Joakim Wilenius, head coach of Finland, told me.
The athlete thought about the protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing, then, because it would have been in vain under the rules of the Olympic Games.
I should have dropped in the water to get credit," said Petjaja-Siren.
The Finn hung on his board until the last, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
With the crash, Finlander remained in place 27.
In the overall situation, the 2012 Olympic silver medalist in London is the eighth.
In terms of the curves, the crash didn't affect much.
Friday is an important day for 10-12 races.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petaja-Siren did not make a protest.
7 special issues that scientificly prolong age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years into a person’s life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life is prolonged.
Sometimes things that a person cannot influence themselves can bring him more years.
These include a tendency to moderate body fat or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong your life.
You don't even have to come around and get the milk can.
The secret of longevity has been sought in many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A study by Harvard University found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to the "lower risk of death", particularly in relation to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, on behalf of alcohol, there are studies that show that reasonable use - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one observed that wine drinkers lived as parents as people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of dental floss can prolong a person’s life for up to six years, says one study.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
On the other hand, they can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study carried out in Norway found out how laughter had an effect on human life.
Over 54 000 people were watched by a project that lasted seven years.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to survive after the experiment.
Sex, when the protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition to everything, it can also prolong the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as it is is not enough.
In order to have more years of life, a person must also have an orgasm.
Of course, mobility will bring more years, it will not be disputed.
However, reaching a long life does not require absolute slatency.
A study at Oxford University found that women with big butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study associated these issues with lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete who got to the Olympic medallions or an actor who won Oscar, he's more likely to live longer than the usual bull.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring his life back for years.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that a long-term age is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, allows for recognitions such as the Nobel Prize to be sought.
A study on shopping behaviour in people over 65 found that a person shopping daily, i.e. a person likely to make shopping less frequently, found that the person shopping daily.
This is due to the fact that running in specific shops reduces loneliness.
Again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may predate death.
So counting the credit card out of your hand... online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
A drunk drunk driver went off towards a truck.
On Friday evening, there was a serious coup between a truck and a passenger car.
The accident took place in Koskella, midday between Koskenten and Sorvastontie at 9 p.m. on Friday.
The truck had been driving towards Forssa, when the passenger car arrived at the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was up and running, but it was on fire.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car went out into the ditch, and then over the ditch to the roof.
The woman, born in 1972, who carried a passenger car, was squeezed into her car.
The rescue unit removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The female's blow test was 2.02 per cent.
He's been suspected of being a heavy drinker.
The mail sent free candy to the wrong city.
There were deficiencies in Salon's range of K-Citymarkets because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to the Seinäjoki River.
On Thursday, Teija Haltia, who lived in Pernio, was buying free candy from Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit the eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the bulk because Posti delivered our load to the Seinäjoki River!
We'll get more when the Post gets the load!
So if you don't get traffic in the lawn, the sign says.
The branding sign of the merchant is linked to the fact that last spring Posti expanded its services to include lawn cutting.
Weed cutting is offered by Post until the end of August.
Haltia felt that the sign was mainly fun and decided to share it in social media.
I was stunned by the popularity of the update.
Media representatives have also been calling all along, and the attention raised by this issue is incredible, and it is a wonder for Halt.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had more than 700 distributions on Facebook.
Haltia got her favorites caught in a bulk bag, even though a few of them were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for the business of the Transport Services of the Posti Enterprises, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three out of the five stage were lost yesterday in the wrong place (Seinajoki), and we no longer went to Saloon with three, but only today we took five stage, and Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
It's the first word in the evening.
Teija Halt wasn't angry with the sign because she found all her favorites in the selection.

The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years from her appearance.
Backlund’s pre- and post-scenario has collected a number of praiseworthy comments from the co-scenarios.
You're amazing, aren't you?
We're on the same road, motivation hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project Do it now.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I'm on the same trip to heaven myself, another tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last pounds of the project We're going to do it now.
At that time he told the evening magazine that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was then ten pounds [10 kg] away.
During the three-month fitness tour, pounds eventually fell to five.
The wish of a woman murdered in Loviisa: The memory of the victim for the benefit of the police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered instead of flowers and addresses with a donation for the benefit of the police dog.
Sipoo Veterinarian station has published a Facebook update, which conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication reports that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Station and also carried out his nursing training there.
The veterinary station remembers a woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, humorous, and fearless of work.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
Facebook updates include an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update states that the total amount of donation money goes to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman in Loviisa Koskenkyla was murdered in her own courtyard.
The woman’s neighbors have told the evening magazine that the victim was very much in love with animals.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and roost.
A 27-year-old man who was suspected of murder didn't know her, and they had no connection.
The killer was followed by a police dog, Börje, who was killed in the arrest.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court ruled against Post for a violation of the Equality Act
The post did not have the right to retain the salary of a worker who refused to become acquainted with the temporary agency worker, and the district court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The District Court obliged Post to pay the employee most of the remuneration he had charged and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Posti could have arrested only part of the inquisitor’s salary, which corresponded to the part of the education throughout the day’s work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity, contrary to the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the decision of the Union for Posti and Logistics to prohibit the introduction of the PAU.
During the postal strike last November, PAU decided that Post’s employees would not be familiar with the renters who broke the strike.
The People's News first told me about it.
Turkey's return to a path that respects human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respective development, written by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In his earlier letter to Sipila and Soin, the Press Union asked Turkey to express its concern for freedom of speech and of the press.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland has repeatedly highlighted to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression.
Putin separated the head of his administration from the Estonian-style Parano
Russian President Vladimir Putin has separated Sergei Ivanov, Head of Presidential Administration, says the Kremlin.
The Soviet-Estonian Communist leader Karl Vayo's grandson, Anton Vaino, will be replaced.
He is a 44-year-old ex- diplomat who has served as Vice-President of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax, a news agency.
Vladimir Putin fired the commander of his administration.
According to the Kreml Bulletin, Ivanov, a member of Putin's close internal circle, will be transferred to specific environmental and transport tasks.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to another assignment and suggested that Heathe be replaced, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union spying on the KGB.
Many thought Ivanov was a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition of the game ban - not seen in the opening of Valoliiga
The world record man of football transfers is not seen in the field when the British Valolia is being kicked out this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed with him to England.
The Manchester United's giant acquisition of Paul Pogba, due to the ban, is being sidelined by ManU on Sunday against Bournemouth, said the BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, the Italian Society of Pogba paid EUR 105 million to Juventus.
However, the English Football Association FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogbale was burdened with the ban on Juventus.
He received two warnings last season at the Italian Cup, and it will be a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is the league's second round on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, the madness of greatness is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally respected event to be attended by the world's top artists.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festarics have typically expressed themselves with their own fashioned clothing.
One of the main stage artists is this year punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stowed, among other things, by artificial grass and art installations.
We have never had enough to have a main stage and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in Summer Bay of Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to the event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The key to success is the simple question: What kind of event would the authors want to go to?
It's kind of different when you take an accident, you think like this.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be here this year to finish the sale.
The aim has been to increase the number of people visiting last year by 5,000.
Even this year, a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists are seen at the festivals.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because it needs to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle guided by huge roads.
That's not what we want.
Over the past 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been enlarged with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in a partly artificial grassed area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller performance platforms, 15,000 people's tents will be the venue this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little bigotry, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If it's lost, it's not our thing anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done for Rock is that even today’s great visions are practically possible.
During the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, activities were highly dependent on the support of approximately 20 000 euros of the City of Helsinki.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was around EUR 6 million.
It's a way to create "creasy things", like building that 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves in their own fashion.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not consciously profiled to be particularly fashionable.
First and foremost, we want to separate ourselves from the content.
However, fashion phenomena also fit Flow's value world: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the top artists is a tick legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at a festival that combines inderock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was beaten, because now is probably the last time this is seen at a concert in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good, and he's been doing some damn good gigs in the last few years.
The bombs of Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in the purses, and the tourists fled in their horrors.
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died and over 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in the flower trap and blown up by cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists began to leave the bars and return to their hotels, said the police representative, Sampoer Yoosumran, according to CNN.
Since 1989, the wild animal protector Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, has taken a large picture of the attacks.
If the TV's not showing properly, you can watch it here.
Of those injured in Hua Hin, at least 11 were foreign tourists.
People ran against me and said that the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest streets of the bar, told Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet by the Swedish secretary.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon thereafter, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, even by the Finns.
No one is known to be dead.
At the same time, a second double-bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police told me they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel troops behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the activities of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken on the activities of criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby team goes first into battle in the war situation
In an acute war situation, military forces are being ordered to fight only several months after the oath of military power, says the Central Finnishman.
According to the Chief of Education of the Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, Brig-Gen Jukka Sonninen, only those who are in the final phase of their training are eligible for battle in war situations, for example, for the five months served by the military.
According to the Head of Training, the first task is to appoint the reserve personnel of the Standby Forces.
None of the backup or reserve personnel are ordered to perform a mission that has not been provided with the required training, says Sonningen.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces are starting to train their guards to the immediate standby units from next year.
The units may be used in military operations, if necessary, as early as the training of the military staff.
Pamela Tola got the huge compensation from the home.
Actor Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey separate house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, the house revealed a serious moisture problem that caused a dangerous microbial growth in health.
The couple had to sell the apartment as a disembarkation in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss for Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and there demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in the district court and court court.
The court ruled on the matter on Wednesday.
It maintained a district court judgment ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for a price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the costs of the couple's trial and settlement.
The court justifies the price reduction slightly, since some of the need to repair the dwelling had already been known to the purchasers when they made the house purchase.
However, according to court law, the errors that occurred were more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home.
In court, Tola told me that the couple had been looking for a good home because they did not want to do any repairs.
He had been given the impression that the building had been renovated and in good condition and that the points mentioned in the health check report were not detrimental.
The fitness check report identified the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rainwaters and melting waters throughout the rock study.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it did not appear that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma thought that some rainwater from the rock should be controlled within a few years.
The transactions were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the housing moisture problems were much more serious than expected.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which according to the Witnesses were due to both rock rainfalls and capillary ground moisture.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector, also reach indoors through the porch.
Homogenous sand or yeast that allows health risk, which exceeds the limit values, was found in the home-care room, the basement stairwell, the living room window and the basement washroom.
Steels were built without permits
The court also contested whether the dwelling had been extended contrary to the building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that the dwelling had been subject to an illegal change.
Among other things, the terraces had been built even though there were no appropriate permits.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Justice, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the sale, the purchasers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for substantial repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma did not consider that there was a particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection.
The purchasers have not failed to comply with their reporting obligations, the Court of Justice states in its judgment.
Horrible Archive: Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for the Nazis - also Finns in the register
In his recent article on Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Andersson writes how microfilm documents have been recorded in the National Archives of Maryland in the United States concerning a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of women are Germans, but they also include Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted Nazi bridesm.
The documents and registration cards come from a racial agency in Nazi Germany.
The Bureau of Racial Affairs was under the leadership of the SS, Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was even more true for women who had to be able to bear up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were carried out in women to find out.
The Bureau of Breeders examined women’s backgrounds, including by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the female family tree.
Women also had to be ready to give up their Swedish citizenship and give life stories and good recommendations to the racial agency.
The Bureau wanted guarantees that women were "loved children", "sustainable" and "good national socialists" who knew very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as bridesmaid of SS men.
The case does not tell us what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
The SS leaders created a state-supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme provided, inter alia, that each SS man should have four children, whether married or not.
Lebensborn homes care for children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not promoted very actively, as the website of the U.S. Holocaust Museum reports.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
A German mother’s honorary cross was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, and the museum's website says.
The sixth of Petjah-Sir, Nirko rose and fell
Tapio Nirko was ranked third in the Finnjolls' first day of the sailing in the Rio Olympic Games, but remained the tailing peak of the entire group on the second day of departure.
In the overall situation, Niko rose eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second departure put him in position 14.
Wind Petjajai-Siren fought for RS:X day slots 17 and 3.
In the overall situation, Petaja-Siren is the sixth.
In the 470s, Jonah and Niklas Lindgren remained in place at the opening of the day 23.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are ranked 19.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so in the canoe"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the favourite Finnish artists for over 20 years.
From the cruiser barmaid to the 1995 Tango King, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of the dance platforms and festivals, the Bridgepää continues to pollinate and is currently in a wild uplift.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen, on the life of the favourite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book The Bridgehead tells of his life and career as good as evil.
The career of the bridgehead rose to a total rise in his victory of the Tango King’s Crown in the Tango Market of the Seinäjoki River in 1995.
In the contest, Bridgehead sang rods, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had, at the request of a man, composed a tango piece that Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in the history of Finnish music.
The book says, however, that recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: The bridgehead sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was in such a mess!
The bridgehead remembers in the book.
You wouldn't think it'd be singing in a hangar.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that all the time I don't have to demand the perfect and the best of myself.
Another incident related to the most popular songs of the man, as reported in the book, took place almost twenty years later.
In 2013, the bridgehead broke up with his partner at the time, and the case eventually ended up in texts of the You deserve gold, which was published as a single copy in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Sara Törmäse were not what the Bridgehead would have wanted.
The bridgehead had imagined that he was making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the distinguishing paragraph were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news in the magazine for 7 days.
In the news of the magazine, the difference between Jari and the ex-lover was explained by Jari’s excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was a full bunny, and it was not true.
According to the book, Jari was angry at the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it, and so it was good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
At the end of the day, 52% of voters voted for the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the polls of the week anticipate the opposite outcome.
British economicists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for the divorce, although a couple of individual researchers were allowed to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The main mantra of Western politics, the theme of the former US President Bill Clinton's earlier election campaign, "It's the economy, towers", flew into a ruin in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when they didn't hear their voice.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important policy issue.
Economic curvature
The Centre for Macroeconomics will respond to the Brexit disaster in its latest monthly survey.
The most typical answer is not to listen to the economists, because this time the voters took a decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the economicians' explanations of the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of employees, thus almost constant.
If the immigrant gets a job, it's from the right British.
Many people also have the impression that a fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing, as it contributes to the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economics Committee, voters did not believe the financial arguments, because the consensus of the economicians was not sufficiently developed.
In particular, it was the neutrality of the BBC, which gave just as much space to economic scientists in favour of the EU's economic difference of only a few per cent, as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU's hateful press was not interested in telling what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR, LSE and other economic power combinations about the consequences of the difference.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both heard and understood, they were ignored because the economists represent an elite with which voters do not think they have common interests.
Academics such as economicians would have stayed in the EU, but the message did not work in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is an economy, too.
The overwhelming winning argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrants take your job, Immigrants rush your hospital, Immigrants take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Each cafe has foreign employees.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British get medical appointments if they weren't there?
Every school has children for immigrants.
How much easier would the children of the true British would be to get a place of school if they were rid of them?
In every municipality, foreigners live.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economicists failed to respond and, if they did, their answers were not visible.
Economists did not succeed in explaining that immigrants have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
The real estate fund in Aberdeen reserved for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments were made by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, the Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
The plan for B, which is the victory of the EU's division, was prepared more precisely a few weeks before the vote in case the result was lost.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
As a rule, real estate funds do not have substantial liquid resources, but could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, the Old One says that Aberdeen's only open daily quote from the real estate fund that was covered by the news.
According to the old man, the normal level would be between 15% and 20%.
At the time, the value of the fund was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is about £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimates that the lowest cash in these funds remained at 10% or even below.
Thus, the real estate funds reserved themselves for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed trade
When the EU-restricted camp won, Europe went nuts.
However, the less than two weeks that followed the vote on the real estate market were quite peaceful, says Olden.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a high risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first real estate fund, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
Together, they robbed the situation and raised the case to the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared immediately with the years 2007 and 2008, says the Old One.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calm, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball began to spin, and the fund had to close its doors after each other.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close down trade, but changed prices downwards.
In practice, the investors were given time to consider whether it is worth pulling the money out in panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't be worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed down the situation, and most of it canceled the announcement.
Since then, it has been quite steady, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks, says the Old One.
He points out that, for example, the continental European funds in Aberdeen did not have any similar shock.
But there were a lot of questions.
disproportionate attention to real estate funds
The old man felt that the closures of the trading of real estate funds received disproportionate attention.
The open funds concerned by the closures account for about 4% of the property in Britain.
Aberdeen’s closure lasted six days and the company sold less than ten properties out of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold on to its fund until the end of 2017.
At present there is uncertainty in the air, and the economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not seem to be 'serious' to Aberdeen.
The major issues now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound and dollar exchange rate is the lowest in 30 years, and the market has a 15% reduction in sales compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar maker can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There's a lot of willing buyers, says the old man.
Brexit brought mines to the London real estate market
At 2 o'clock in the morning, the situation didn't look too bad.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who was responsible for the real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
There's a strong word for it.
I realized this is going to plan B now, says the Old One in his second home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
The City of London was already fully alive despite the night of the morning.
The TV screens that were normally set to be silent at the office provided news, and normally loud people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell about his divorce.
As the market opened up, the screen terminals flashed only red.
It was a morning you never thought you'd be alive, says the Old One.
It is not, therefore, that, in spite of the riot at Aberdeen, one of the biggest real estate funds in Britain, concluded two real estate transactions on the day following the Brexit vote.
It was a mess.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, so the situation was somewhat peaceful, says Olden.
The Brexit vote started with the correction movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership switched.
The market was beginning to anticipate severe fallbacks on the property market in Britain and, in particular, in London.
In the coming years, up to 20% of the mines were projected at London office facilities.
Soon a number of real estate funds in Britain began to freeze their trade one after the other.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it is not visible on the face of the Old Man who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
In his view, it is far too early to say much about what is going on with Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been first reported.
CBRE’s data on price developments cover about one third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, minus 6.1 per cent was collected, says Olden.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, says Olden.
All the equally large falls hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting that Brexit was compared very quickly with Lehman's fall and with the global economic crisis that started on the US real estate market.
The old man feels that the parable is not quite correct, because this is a British crisis.
There's another mood, too.
The real estate market has now seen not a panic sale like that, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Olden.
There's also a standard financial cover.
The repair shop could have been in the front anyway.
In fact, he doesn't think it's a miracle that there could have been such a thing without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen, the prices of London’s and other world’s number one buildings have been too high for years.
For two years now, we have said that City and especially the offices are overpriced, says the Old One.
So the fall started really high.
London's prices have gone up for four reasons, the Old One's list.
The British economy has grown strongly, so has the London population.
Another big trend is that properties are the last ownership class that is globalized, says the Old One.
New players have become markets in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are also looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fed by low interest rates, which have led pension companies, for example, to looking for revenue from new items.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although the debt lever has been used according to the Old Ones now clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, disperse
In London, the price increase stabilised last summer, says the Old One.
Aberdeen also started to lighten its ownership in London, and last year there was a net seller.
There was some kind of turnaround to be expected, and now it's here.
What's from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says the Old One.
Many he dares to judge the future, but says that no ascent is expected.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a descending or steady running ahead.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the holes are going to survive with work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you will be in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, it's too much of a victim.
If you've been disbanded, the risks are also decentralised, the Old One says.
The S-Group will start to register the purchase information more closely than before.
Soon the S-Group will know what you are eating, as today the trading group told us that it is starting to collect more accurate information about its customers' purchases.
Once the information has been collected so far from the total amount of the receipt, the group will start to absorb it from the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S-Group is coming after Kesko here, as data on goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a few years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data shall be collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing on an authorised basis.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, says Riitala to the economic message.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to the S-Group registration change.
Kesko is already classifying its parent client into ten groups according to just grocery stores.
The classification shall be updated on a monthly basis.
Customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money they spend on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from K Group's own chains.
Co-operation partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer program and this is not planned.
Finland's Close Trade has its own 1st Bonus customer program, which can be associated with it in Valitalo, Siwok and Euromarkets.
At the moment we do not collect product or product group information, we stick to the total amount of receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made, and that's the day, and the final amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to that level as K-Group or S-Group, says commercial leader Anu Ora.
According to him, the main customer programme is to be reformed in the future, but the Close Trade will tell you about it later.
However, the Ora does not allow registration of product information.
First try
The customer and customer register of SOK has been relatively extensive to date.
In addition to personal and address data, basic data included occupation, education, form of residence and children's birth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role have also been registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, the total amount of purchases and the method of payment have been recorded in the S-Certificate purchase.
In addition, the data of the S-bonus partners have been obtained from their cash-flow systems.
From the beginning of May, product level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
On the other hand, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains data are currently recorded at product group level.
Customers have long been hoping that marketing could be more targeted, says Marjana Saarikoski, head of the customer and partner activities of SOK.
The S-Group says that they will inform their customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data are stored in the funds anyway, whether they want it or not.
A willing person can check his stored information on the S-Group website.
For example, the cashiers do not have access to the information, says Saarikoski.
Video: The Heila puppy is Customs's newest dog confirmation - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador Puppet is vigourfully sniffing five similar boxes placed in line in the country at Helsinki Airport.
It won't take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio will reward his Heila dog to play it with his favorite toy.
The box next to which Heila sat revealed a jar of smelting casings.
Square gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of Heila.
Security situation and internet commerce access
Heila is Customs's first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports, if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main job because the international security situation has changed as a result of the serious terrorist attacks that have taken place in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in Customs and, after the attacks, control has been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, customs inspector.
The second way to train a weapons and explosives dog is by post through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, up to 40 million mails are sent annually through the airport, which may include arms and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made internet shops at Helsinki Airport, from shopping, passenger baggage and air cargo to about 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their starting materials.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It's going to look into checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is very keen on the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of the Heila pup is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonum.
Suntio is also in training with Heila at the police and Defence Forces experts.
The police have strong experience in dog training and defense expertise in explosives.
Customs will decide together with other authorities what smells Heila will be taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are six drug dogs in Customs, as well as money and drug dogs Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for selecting the dog to be selected at the airport include a snottling and hunting season, and a calming, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion’s home, is a close associate with the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't go anywhere without Heila at home. Suntio's laughing.
Pregnant orders come to Heila from a one-time camp.
The cameraman of the evening-Sanomies loses the camera mike cover for the fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-looking shield immediately from the "get-out" command.
Hard competition from working dogs
Heila's initial education will be completed next year.
There are still standard tests ahead, next in October, which assesses whether training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen in work on the side of Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron the dog on the working vests, similar to Suntio.
The cost of a single working dog is around EUR 60000-70000 per year for customs purposes.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten years, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
Working days may be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active part-times can only last from ten to two hours.
The owner of working dogs is a tough competition in Customs.
Heila's owner was about 20-30 Customs employees.
The luck hit Suntion, which has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in Customs.
The Ministries got their first Olympic medal. People get a day off.
The Olympic gold of Fiji, less than a million inhabitants, in rugby, is so highly appreciated in the country that the government has ordered August 22 to be a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcasting company, the Fijian government confirmed the issue after the championship was resolved.
The day off is the day after the team's return.
There are also festiveities for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team is celebrating the championship.
The Guardian reports that the finals were followed in the capital of Suva, where a screen was set up for the stadium.
Normally, only the native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage it, said Fiji Times reporter to Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish Buyer passed out after a wild performance
Milko Tokola, a printing company, succeeded from 175 kg after a hard battle.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening quality as a lift.
During or immediately after heavy liftings, he has passed out many times.
No one's really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola received 175 kilos of push and 145 kilos of push.
His combined result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get her job at the last 175 kilos, as did one of them.
With the third attempt, the weights rose as a result of the wild roaring.
The body was shaking under the weights until the jury accepted the lift.
The joy of the Finnish collector was expressed by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS has acquired the Estonian instigator Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanaomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, playing in the Men's Football League, has concluded a lasting agreement with the Estonian protagonist Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a team leader who has power and has a small threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi.
Over ten players and I went through more than 50 players from all over the world.
Little by little, Prosa, coach of RoPS, Juha Malinen, reported on a good alternative.
Prosa, 25, comes to RoPS from Tallin, Flora, where she scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played on the Estonian national team.
Prosan is due to be with RoPS already on Saturday in the Seinäjoki River, where the Rovaniemins meet the ruling Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new assailant when last season's secular king Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
A proud Modern Family star once again, the teenage star shorts reveal almost everything.
As a nice Alex Dunphyna introduced to the modern family comedy series, Ariel Winter re-flashes his proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in minisorts that don't leave much to imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also his butt.
Lately, 18-year-old Winter has attracted attention by making his style and behaviour much more courageous.
The star has posed in his social media pictures in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressed in very scarce suits.
Winter, on the verge of adulthood, has recently also published several pictures of himself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked the experts why Winter has changed his image so radically.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter would have a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost all his life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you show the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has annoyed some of his long-term fans with his image transformation.
It is not difficult to guess where he will be in ten years, when the tide is now so hard, says one woman in Winter's Instagram.
Some of her fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge her not to care about the criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what the others say.
You're an inspiration to many women, a young woman.
The Japanese prefer to go from the Nordics to Finland - tourists are attracted to the northern part: In autumn it is possible to see the random mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start their northern northern northern northern northern northern Finland, says Visit Finland in the newsletter.
The main destinations of Japanese northern tourism are Inari and Levi.
The northern lights are the card of our winter travel, and they are strongly connected to the heart winter and the snowy landscapes.
In the winter of Lapland, the northern windmills have a lot of demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
It is rare to know that the reventing season begins early in the autumn and continues far into the spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision two times a fairytale, says Anne Lind, Marketing Manager of Visit Finland.
The main focus of the Revantum campaign of Visit Finland is the wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35, who are living in the city, who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey carried out by Aalto University and researchers from the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like clearer unique sights from Finland, and this northern windmill, according to Lind, has enormous potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown much more in Finland than the other Nordic countries.
Last year they stayed more than twice as long in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finnish tourism as a target group, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain will be satisfied with the rugby silver championship of Fid, leading to gold
The impressive progress of Great Britain in the rugby tournament collapsed to Fidz's final challenge at the Thursday night final when the team experienced a 43-7 crush loss at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi held a master's class in the game, chewing gums, detours, support games, running games, and jubilees in power to win gold... their first Olympic medal.
With the loss came a reasonable comfort from the silver medallion - the third of Britain's day - and they were proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby tournament, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The tough 7-5 win of the semifinal played the same day from South Africa could bother them in the finals.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a top-of-the-line team of 15 in this condition.
Great Britain may be, but it's probably not comforting that at least one of the British have a gold medal on their necks tomorrow: the chief coach of Fid is Ben Ryan, a former English boss from Wimbledon.
Great Britain has been quite a journey.
Eight years ago, coached by Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
This is where they lost only one.
This back-sail hurts, but it's a shocking development.
Fidi started excellently against the British struggles for fun.
To Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like they were running on moving buses, and world champions drove 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived into the finish zone in the corner.
When the clock was four minutes, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right led to a goal.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great tack stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it was only slow for Fid.
At seven minutes Jasa Veremalua scored at the right angle, and Britain was 17-0 at the top.
Nakarawa scored again for a new start, and the clock still had more than a minute left...the first half.
After that Vatemo Ravouvou rushed through the found battles in Great Britain and rushed into the line to score.
After the paint kick, the situation was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Britain was just learning the game.
And that's actually how it is.
The United Kingdom made a series of changes in support which blocked the Fid dam for a total of four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored a goal after Fid's impressive pitch game.
Dan Norton scored a goal for the UK in the left corner of Touchdown and narrowed the situation to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the viewers.
It was difficult not to admire Fid’s joyous approach.
Mata Viliame's last-minute paint was a peeling in Fid's cake that didn't need the peeling.
The whistle was whistled, the Fidinians hugged, and Great Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day Fidi had struck Japan at the semifinal of 20-5, and Great Britain won South Africa at the tight semifinal, where both scored one goal - the British goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with a dazzling footwork and scored under the goals in the second half.
A great late tack from Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the 15th-French-Rugby Team in England, secured victory and finally a silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer led Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to a row victory.
There will be no more emotional gold in these games, and that really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard to the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment in Estacio da Lagola.
Even though they rowed together, there were three votes on the boat, and Coach Robin Williams' echo was there all the time when the two were fighting for their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's doubles, the first women in the history books of British sports to achieve this.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance undefeated, which is also recordable.
This is what we see, two brilliant athletes joining the surface with the sweetness of the swan, not entirely reflecting the nature of victory.
Each row gold has a group of helpful couples who are gradually promoting things that matter, and not one pair of hands was as essential as a coach who didn't know 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer, whether he would live to this day.
Like he said, the situation was pretty tight.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they did the surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your way of thinking a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that his treatment could be started at the beginning of 2014 outside the period when they caused as little disturbance as possible - if that expression could ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I was walking all over the ward, 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said that a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
The rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first couple of ideas was Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Artillery regiment of Afghanistan, said: "I have been a tunnel ruin this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just stresses how important this is to me, how hard I and Helen, and Robin too, we have worked.
For the past three years, Helen and Robin have been great.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't be doing anything, so he's got a lot to thank, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost the competition in five years.
A couple set a tough rhythm that their competitors couldn't reach.
Even at the last 500 metres, as the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in storage.
We were very tight in a moment.
Helen shouted "Stay in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not try to do anything special.
We didn't look for fireworks today, we were just trying to get a good race and win the race, and that's what we did.
A couple of years wait before you decide your future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when he's getting married to TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't mean to say this would be my last competition.
It would have put too much pressure on you.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was the Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed out.
This is where it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland will change the government of the Panaman leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which will be called for by the infuriated protestors of the Panaman data leaks already in spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that many Icelandic politicians were circumventing taxes by means of tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for protestors.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold a new parliamentary election in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
Analysts say that it is difficult to predict how much the people's last - spring rage influences the result of the autumn election.
In June, the presidential election showed clear criticism of the authorities, and Gudni Johnson, a candidate from outside the policy, was elected President.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isis.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump of the United States has withdrawn his latest court-martials.
He said that he was sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organisation Isis and the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would be involved in the establishment of the organisation.
The Democratic Party got angry with speeches and asked Trump to apologize.
As chief of the army, you should never let anyone fall down like that, Clinton's TV.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a masked burkini swimsuit popular by Muslims on the beaches, says, among other things, the British magazine Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for everyone who has no good manners and a bathing suit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which greatly express religious ties, may increase the risk of disorderly conduct in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice, while a 31-year-old man drove to the crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremisms linked to Isis attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the screening - the blue-shoeing drizzle in Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only a blue ling has been observed on Lake Pyykösjärvi's bathing area.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental activity of the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU coasts and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu region.
Apart from the coast of Meriniemi, the concentrations of all bathing waters of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in bathing areas were below the limits of the measures laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E. coli and enterococcals in the shore of the Meriniemi bathing area were confirmed on Wednesday, when the levels of bacteria had fallen below the operational limits.
The blue liquefaction found on the shores of the lake of pyrophagus does not yet make the water unswimable, but under favourable conditions the situation may quickly turn into a blue lush flower, resulting in the formation of a blue green resting mass in the water.
Environmental action will monitor the situation by means of increased inspections.

MTK’s Hakarainen Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The reduction of forest gifts is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generational change of forest holdings.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal for a reduction in forest gifts has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to stimulate the age structure of forest owners, to increase forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry’s aim is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would make a reduction in the clean income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational change of forest holdings is a good one, comments Juha Hakarainen, Director of Forests of the Central Union of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, it is difficult to find a criticism in the proposed tax change.
The reduction of forest gifts is proposed for the forest owner’s clean capital income.
This is the capital income minus any other deductions.
According to MTK and Haharinen, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the result of the sale of wood.
The VM's proposal is based on a reduction in the net income from forestry, which prevents the loss of the income from forestry, which would have to be deducted from other taxes.
Such a person would benefit from tax even if he did not sell the wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner can't see it, says Hakarainen.
In addition, he said that the model concerns only a small part of the forest owners.
The tax reduction threshold linked to the income of the forest is EUR 40 000.
It's been pulled too high in Haharinen's mind.
As such, he said that 82 percent of Finnish forest owners were cut off from the district.
The model would affect about 10% of forest ownership, he says.
The VM considers that the border guarantees the objective of growing the farm size.
In forest policy, the reduction of forest gifts has been taken by Haharinen for decades.
It is due to the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently more than 60 years, and about half of the forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful raid surprised the drivers at Himanga... two cars went down into a ditch and hit each other.
There was a special chase in the Himanga of Kalajoki on Friday morning.
According to the rescue unit, two consecutive cars went down into a ditch, after which they crashed after the driver.
According to the chief firefighter Harri Pyht, the deportation of the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a powerful raid.
There were two people in the back of the car who were both transported to the hospital for treatment.
There's no more detailed information on their injuries.
The driver of the previous car was not injured.
The accident took place on highway 8 from Himanga a few miles to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more effectively.
Professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group’s findings show that the severity of cancer cancer increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer medications may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and the surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results have been published on 4 August in the prestigious Nature Communications magazine in the field of cell biology.
The tree of the Muhos family death continues in the court, the prosecution also demands a murder sentence for the other person who did it.
The tree of Muhos' home death continues in the court for both convicted.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the death of a family home in Muhos.
One received 8 years of 4 months for, among other things, killing and gross robbery as a young person.
One is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder and gross robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of killing was also convicted of a gross endangerment of road safety as a young person and of the right to transport a vehicle as a young person.
The District Court’s judgment was appealed to by the prosecutor, the prosecutors and the man who received the harsher sentence.
The prosecution demands that a man who has been punished for murder as a young person be sentenced to 12 years in prison.
They were at the time of the act in full understanding.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old young people killed a man who worked as a head of a child protection unit in the school home in July of last year.
The 17-year-old who was sentenced to murder attacked the pilot who sat on the couch of the living room behind the verdict.
The director had come out of the grip and dragged a young man into his room, when one of the young ones hit him with a suction tube.
Among other things, the director was strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the mind poll, both convicted were at the time of the act fully understood.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape from a family home at least from the previous day.
The ice shark is the longest-aged spine in the world, growing only at 156 years of age.
The world’s longest living vertebrae is a secure ice shark, reports a study published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, like the ice shark swimming around Greenland, the holler can live up to 400 years of age.
The female is only growing at 156 years of age.
The more life I spent in the ice shark, the only thing growing is a centimetre a year.
Only one species of bivalve molluscs is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Researchers found his age by radiocarbon dating.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950s, there were radioactive residues in some sharks.
They enabled researchers to assess the age of sharks.
The elder was estimated at 392 years for his age, though a throw in the direction or another could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic visa - People's News
The Americas of Donald Trump don't need to change the world.
Even a third of the State's total tax revenue would not be received if the change to the corporate tax imposed by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular with tax relief for the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
Business tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without collection, there would be a huge amount of $1,000 billion a year.
The highest rate of income tax is now 39.6, after the reduction presented by Trump 33.
The inheritance tax would be completely waived.
Trump accused the State of over-regulation of the business and the bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental standards decided on by the emergency must be reformulated and the energy regulation must be decommissioned.
The health reform of Barack Obama must be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed 'experts instead of bureaucrats'.
According to Trump, the 'destroyable' trade policy is one of the major causes of the problems in the United States.
Free trade agreements would be waived.
45% of imports from China and 35% of Mexico would be subject to a penalty tax.
We're offering you a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
The Americas of Donald Trump do not need to change the world:
American cars will drive in the streets, American planes will unite cities, American ships will control the sea, American steel will lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his manners, Trump faithfully read a speech written by his assistants, even though well - organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists, including those close to the Republicans, will see Trump's program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced Finnish time early on Friday.
Attack wave from the past - People's News
The sea is fatally storming, but a real wave of attack strikes in the middle of Madrid's street violet - an account with the past can begin.
That summed up Pedro Almodóvar's novelty story.
Almodovar's previous guidance Travel lovers (2013) were a little fun and a bunch of satirical comedy, the previous skin where I live (2011) the peaks of the Spanish style career.
Similarly, Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It's a love, relationship and family drama of a fit interior with a mother-daughter relationship at the heart of it.
The story is simple and we see a lot of it as a long ass.
Life seems to be on the line with the middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
A new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) may be amazed to the end of the film.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Julieta repeated the stages of her life to her adult daughter.
She begins from the time before the birth of her daughter, from the times when she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, rises to the second main part of the TV series, the time between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta's ageing has been dealt with in a way that can be considered a homicidal, but I would like to say that it is rather a sly and literally one-off.
Almodóvar films often have a fair distance in Julieta to such a typical rumbler.
It is an equally played, controlled, place with good music and a rather sad film with elements for elegance.
On the other hand, the Spanish director’s typical visual color abundance is maintained and so that it begins to look a little quiet in the eye as a pure form rather than as a functioning dramatic means of action.
The people in the film are affected by diseases, deaths or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is particularly true of the costume: in the case of a nominal person, the costumes change from scene to scene, and the same applies to visible ears.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main thing, or the nucleus of each seizure, is not particularly improving.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly breathless.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript based on three novels by Canadian Alice Munro, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2013.
Novellit has been published in Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a bit of equal-fat written literary filmation.
Materials would have been emotionally inextricably steeper for drama, so many big things - especially the fading guilt - the subject matter of the film.
Control and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novels from Alice Munro.
Mainly Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying to do an election game - People's News
No new cuts will be made, the ministers say, so that the basic Finns do not collapse completely.
However, the operations decided on in the spring will be carried out by a huge trade.
There will be no new surgery.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
Thus, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Central Minister of Finance) are convinced under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, as social security cuts were already decided in the spring framework.
Children's pensions, national pensions, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pension Index will be reduced by 0.85%.
The duration of unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
The training is continuing.
The locals haunt
Why are ministers so hard to stress that no new cuts are being made on these?
Because next year's the election year.
The municipal halls will be held in April and they will be the most important heat meter of the parliamentary term, not the gallupes.
It has been seen in the past that the result of the municipal elections in the different directions of the government parties is ruining the government's mood for a long time.
However, the Gallup report that the Government Party's basic Finns are facing a sharp loss, although the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns of Finland received 752 new councillors, most of which will be realised in the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeline of the government of the three parties of the same size depends on the fact that the people of the basic Finns will endure.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those voting in the party have had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group have also come to the surface.
First of all, the rhetoric of the new cuts does not obscure the fact that next year they will be made harshly and, second, try to soften the expectant attack on the basic Finns.
Large surgery in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different if Sipilä's government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of breaking down debt during this parliamentary term, but next year, Petteri Orpo's budget proposal will be owed EUR 5.9 billion, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is not able to follow its own programme: debt is neither protracted nor even slowing down.
One is to hold on to the program.
It means newer cuts to the former ones in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would at least be placed close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring, it will be adopted in the parliamentary elections.
These measures do not give rise to a degree of debt
It is quite clear that the current measures do not tend to lead to debt, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to stimulate a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by the Secretary of State at the awareness of the budget of Martti Hetemäen testify irreconcilably:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimal, i.e. no veto for the international economy.
Since the collapse in 2008, the Finnish economy has not risen much, except during the temporary recovery policy of the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has increased from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
In the curves presented by the Week, government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the mid-term of next decade.
What's responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt relief presented by the Left Union was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
In the coming year, unemployment maintenance will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be fully covered by the new debt.
This is the concept of the centre, the assembly and the basic Finns of what is responsible.
Question: You want to leave a lot of work to the municipalities
Three out of four believe that the organisation of child day care, youth work and physical activity are the responsibility of the municipality, as shown in the study of the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people are also responsible for libraries, culture, civic schools, building supervision, high school education and waste management.
In turn, regional planning, specialised health care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with developmental disabilities are more clearly sought for the responsibility of the region.
There is no wish to transfer any tasks under the authority of the municipalities to the State.
At the end of the chase, a minor drinker ran away from the police.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist in Joensuu drove a police patrol in Ilomansinti, Joensuu, at 6:30 p.m. on Friday night.
Police patrol tried to stop a motorbike without lights, but a young man left to run the police for a fair speed.
The rear drive continued on the Sonkajanranta road, from which to the Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but the quickest cop ran into the fugitive.
The blow test for the driver showed 0.75 per cent.
Nor did he have a driving licence that would justify riding a motorcycle.
The case is examined, inter alia, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the stone cargo fell into a ditch.
The truck in the stone cargo fell into a ditch on Lake Knee in Kaavintie at 21.15 p.m. on Thursday night.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved corner out of the way and fell on its side into a ditch.
The rescue unit lifted the injured driver out of the fallen truck through the door above the car together with the rescue helicopter personnel and first-aid nurses.
It was up to the car owner to pick up the vehicle.
From the crashed truck, there was a spill of hydraulic oil in the road, which was absorbed into the peat by the rescue facility.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The old woman disappeared this afternoon in the Air River.
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Lahtinküla, South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about five feet [ 165 cm] long, thin, and benign, with white hair below her jaw.
The findings and clues of missing movements are requested to call the Nordic Status Centre’s tip number 0295440513.
A major accident in the air - see the photo gallery on Parafest’s destruction
The flooding current that crashed the tents of the Parafest Festivals caused massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafestivities, estimates that the festival will be able to get to its feet economically, and the event can also be held next year.
Kalle Salonen, the last performer of the Parafest, appeared on the market at the end of the Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with the performances to be held at the premises of the city theatre starting at 13.00.
The Art Centre in Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition between 1 p.m. and 3:00 p.m.
The programme will be organised as planned.
When rainwater and its weight trigger a falling air flow, the rush flow is generated in a thunderstorm.
Changes in the state of the thunder cloud water bind heat, so the falling air mass cools down and speeds up toward the earth.
The Department of Aeroscience reports that several flooding flows occur in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the course of the flood currents.
The rush flow struck the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the scene of Parafest, on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents went down, there were about 200 people in the tents.
In an accident, four people were mildly offended.
There was one child in the group who was slightly injured by further treatment.
Air pollution obsolescence in London
According to the study, the skin of the Lontoans is ageing faster than usual.
Air pollution is the cause of skin ageing.
It's the Evening Standard that tells us about the British research.
The British skin care company Caci analyses London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many pensioners in London is two and a half years older than a partner living in rural areas.
The skin - aging small particles are very fine dusty, which comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, almost 9,500 Londoners die every year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early aging is a risk, especially for those in London who walk their journeys around congested streets.
For example, London residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution by different masks, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed the man in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man was not under it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital seriously injured for further examination.
The tractor did not flow any further, as it ran into the stones in front of it.
Rising with the latest force for the coming season
The League-Riento, playing in the volleyball Championship, starts in October from a better starting point than the male memory.
The team's been together for three weeks.
The common song can be found with certainty better than in the previous seasons, when the start of the series has been darker for Rienno.
Jani Siäisä, who continues as the main coach of the cheer, commends the new team as entrepreneurship and unity.
Out of the three foreigners, Fred Musoni will begin his second season in Riento.
The new face is 23 years old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson on Rwanda's country team is a 205-inch hacker.
Garchet, like, is a passer, and the Brazilian has a gauge of 198 cents.
Josban, Kataja and the River Boys to the US National Team
Anne Jopartneren has played in almost all the hallband World Cups since 2003.
Now Tampere is in the sixth race, only 2013 was missed out on Canada’s better cutbacks in North America.
I was working in Turku and playing with the women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a country team for the Salibandy.
I was interested, and here we are, Partner, 48, says.
The partner was born in 1967 near New York City of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987, the Partner got to the University of Joensuu to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, that kind of game was not yet played at the MS level as a salibandy.
It's just that they used to play the show at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja, and later in Jokipoji I played hockey in the MS series.
The partner played with the university in the Salibandy's MS series for the 1991-92 season, and the following three took place in Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the A-girls of the club for the championship.
The women's SM-series career peaked in silver in 1995.
In total, the Partner played in the women's marker series through 10, with a balance of 169 in the match 51+34=85.
The most recent MS period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Vänänen were appointed to the country team
The Joensuu Salibandy Association was raised by Perttu Puska and the Enoli-based Tatu Vänänen was selected for the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech Brnon EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, an attacking 25-year-old in Helsinki, has played this game before six men's field matches, where he has accumulated total power points 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old Swiss defenseman, Tatu Vänänen, has recovered from the femur and is part of the country team's standard equipment with 117 ground fighting experiences.
Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in the Finnish shirt last time in the World Cup last December, was also appointed to the national team.
The main coach of the Salibandy County team is Petri Kettunen, a Contiolahtian.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes to Kouvola - marker gold is missing from the award box
Essi Hasu is about to end up as a beach volley player, at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish championships for Beach Volley will be awarded at Kouvola Sports Park at the weekend.
In three days, the medals will be played in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volleyballers and the Finnish Volleyball Association, six of the best pairs of each series's rankings are eligible for the MS finals.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Elimäe's NMKY raised by Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volley peaks for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many as possible get to the scene this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for the pesis stadium.
I haven't played in adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, funny mood.
The Kouvola region lit Hasu’s spark for sport and gave good food for a fine hobby.
There are well memories of childhood.
I started the volleyball at the age of nine in the E-girls of Elimäe's NMKY.
The top is too big a toy shirt in the mind, kneecaps in the ankles, and huge ass screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small locality, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group's spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone's families were very active. The father of a teammate trained us, and our mother was the chairman of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasulle a beach volley was already a natural species selection for the inner balloon during the junior age.
Since the 1990s, there has been a bit of a game on the beach.
The action has always been active.
I also went myself to watch the semi-finals of the J.M. tour, thinking that one day I'd be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays the weekend together with Anniina Parkkinen of the Peksämäki in the SM finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked double in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We're still missing the award box, Hasu throws a mystery.
The appearance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last in front of the familiar audience for Hasu.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civilian work await.
Yes, the international career is over after the tournament.
Otherwise, the toes will be nailed at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon Koli left bravely for the farmer.
As an entrepreneur, agriculture means taking risks, sweating and vigour.
The young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he also believes in a positive future in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli and his little brother Valtter Kol began acting as a continuation of their home space.
Their father, Mark Koli, helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come to hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to be on the farm, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think we have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we left to build a driveway, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
However, I was very bravely involved in the project myself, and I have been fully involved in it, Solomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would turn out well.
The goal of Solomon Kol, who grows meat cars, is to invest in an even bigger nave.
The work has produced results because Solomon Koli has been selected as the top ten in the competition of the young food producer in the future of rural areas.
At the moment, he's competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the website of the magazine until 21 August.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest figure for years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero after October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
The annual average inflation, measured by the cost of living index, was -0.8% (August 2015 - July 2016) over the last 12 months compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The life cost index of July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate has been -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, the price of the following consumer goods showed an increase: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
The "anime" effect of Snapchat is considered as the Asian cartoon type
According to Snapchat, anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables some 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that suits Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lens are simple, facial - twisting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfiets a day.
All the missteps will quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticised for the fact that the application advertises blackface or black face mask or favours bleached skin color as a beauty design.
So when Snapchat advertised to some users this week a lens that gave them the bad eyes, the bad teeth and the fat cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asian people - the yellow face, or yellowface.
And they were wondering if these repetitive poles could be a sign of the company's greater problem of diversity.
The news and abuse spread widely on Wednesday with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, the day later Snapchat said that he had ceased his feature.
The company offered an explanation: the lens was meant to be a tribute to anime characters, not a cartoon of Asians.
But for observers who had experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others said no to anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose twiite photographs were widely shared, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that "it is difficult to argue against a comparison with a side-by-side gross Asian cartoon and filter effects".
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face, taken to extreme disdain.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be attached to the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood, and from equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s vast, racially older youth audience can mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
At the interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image, "it's much harder for these guys to be unnoticed".
On Thursday, Zhu, Product Manager and Engineer working for Medium, decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his book to Medium and in his telephone interview, he said that he believed that racial disputes reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat's pay practices.
Zhu criticised the company mainly for the white male leadership and finished his writing with hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#RemoveSnapchat)
"They either do not have a diverse representation of different skin colors on their staff, which is why they are able to make such decisions," said Zhu, Chinese-American, "or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they would feel safe or could speak straight."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial situation of its staff, but according to the representative, the company hired a recruiter some time ago to focus on under-represented populations and to move on internal integration efforts.
For its part, Zhu said that he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding: "It is true that they actually need more users like us to say that this is not okay."
According to the Congress panel, military officials were distorting Isis intelligence.
In a report published on Thursday, the Congressional Panel said that the U.S. Military Forces headquarters of the United States armed forces had modified intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against Isis in Iraq and Syria than was justified by events on the ground.
In the interim report of the working group set up by the President of the Republican Committee on Defence Forces of the House of Representatives, the Intelligence Committee and the Sub-Committee on Defence Appropriations, a 'wide dissatisfaction' was found among the intelligence analysts of the headquarters who said that the superiors were faring from the American efforts to defeat Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the military military mission in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence outputs approved by higher-value Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of US counter-terrorism efforts than what the facts on the ground justified; they were, on a regular basis, more positive than the analyses of other factors produced by the intelligence community," said the report in the press release.
"Centcom's events are unacceptable - our fighters in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," said Congressman Ken Calvert, California Republican.
The failure of Centcom's leadership reaches the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the constant problems of the headquarters descriptions and analyses of the U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the high-level administrative authorities of the Obama regime have ordered reports to be tampered with, it shows that analysts felt that the Centcom leaders had put pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic State, Isis, in a more positive light.
"For the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were much more positive than the events themselves," the report said.
For example, the Centcom Authority publicly stated that a major attack to take back Mosul could begin even as early as in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in Isis' possession.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," said MP Mike Pompeo, the Republican of Kansas, in the opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence leaders of the U.S. military headquarters manipulated the headquarters' intelligence outputs in order to reduce the threat to Isis in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a working group after hearing that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence from the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday follows more extensive results while the investigation is under way.
The D.O.A. has begun an additional ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, members of the Democratic Committee of the House of Representatives published their own findings, which were in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"Centcom, from 2014 to 2015, created an excessively isolated process for the intelligence assessment of the security forces of Isis and Iraq", spokesperson Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's leading Democrat, said in the opinion.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the publication of intelligence products", made the mood worse for analysts and "sufficient space for different perspectives".
Schiff and the Democrats said that they could not find evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on the Centcom analysts to match their conclusions to the "pre-set or political report".
The Daily Beast will report on Tuesday on the preliminary findings of the Congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon’s superintendent has begun an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in the opinion that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the Congress report as long as the inspector's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security".
The investigation also has other consequences than the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defence authorities now claim).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can count on the headquarters to provide honest estimates of the military activities of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
The criticism of the Islamic state's intelligence reflects the dispute over a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article saying that despite the objections of several analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small army in Iraq and used very little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion on Islamic intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker Group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, air attacks on refineries controlled by the Islamic State had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters, however.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticised last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
For the fourth time in a row in women's country hockey, the United States will win an in-depth investigation with Britain
The day after having scored three goals for the team winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored on Thursday for the US Women's Country Hockey Team of the first two goals for the Americans winning India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps records of his paintings."
But this is what he knows: the Americans are in the 4-0 Olympic tournament, and they share their team first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
On Saturday, Britain and the United States will meet in the last round of the first round.
Both teams have survived the quarter-terms, and this game will determine who will be first and who will be second in their six teams.
The first is to avoid a strong Dutch leader, a second group leader, a little longer at the start of the quarter finals.
Whatever the end of Saturday’s game, the Americans have aroused their surprising success here, four years after they stayed at the London Olympics for the last 12 teams.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in the Blue Bell in Pennsylvania and picked up the ground hockey bat for the first time at the age of 3 (as his parents played a double sister in Drexel) in connection with the country team at the age of 16, when he became the youngest player of all time.
He was not involved in the 2008 Olympics because he did not enter the final list of players.
In 2012, nothing went well for him and his teammates.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed as a coach, and things began to change.
"Culture change, mental change, physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the same rate of work in London as we do now.
We've done a full translation.
On Thursday night, Bam started his first half-time paint close to the finish line.
India had entered the game with no victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation in the 1-0s until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He was carrying the ball on the left side of the field for a long time, then he went into the middle and pulled the ball into the finish, taking the Americans to the 2-0 line.
Melissa Gonzalez added the fourth round in the middle of the final goal.
This zero game was the first U.S. goaltender to Jackie Briggs, who had won one of each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the end result of the Saturday game.
The peace of trampolin in the middle of the Olympics
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable message of competition and effort.
It's as if the Olympic torch itself is a flaming comma transmitted from the archer to the swimmer and the gymnast to the triathlonist.
It's impossible to put on television, read a newspaper or listen to a guest talk in the coffee line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time Olympic and future heart-breaker with a smile, could very well be one of the names everyone knows about, presented at the best time of view, supported by sponsorship agreements and TV commercials of good mind - if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, from the California Lake Forest, 28, is competing for the Olympic gold in the trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species as much.
Far from the center, partly in the shadow, are those species that are not generally accepted by all: air gun shooting, spring shoot, featherball, taekwondo.
We always have a breast swim, long live.
But if I may make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the contained charm of the trampolin.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000 when it first appeared in Sydney Games, its presence in the past 16 years is so limited that many of the people I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic race at all.
This can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the race, it has never won the medal and its athlete did not make it to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share male, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie McLenna are defending London's gold medals.
Trampoliin, however, involves a certain appeal of the underdog, partly because it sounds better suited to clown school than to the Olympic Games.
Here I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just an inability fan.
There are opportunities for fun in the species, as you can see from the colouring of endless pops of cartoons, but it also has the sweetness of gymnastics and swimming jumps, the two species that are basically united in it.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means a platform.
The champion’s goalners jumped up to 30 feet with a giant trampoline, and they have to perform rolling business series (turns, skill and Volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they will be assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
There are 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women in Rio.
The most common direction of the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
Those who wish for medals must go looking for gold longer, faster, up and over - sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They hunt not only the finish line or the opening wall, but also, in televisiond news, another grinning border: World or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical, and can even bring a viewer to tears.
But that is also the reason why watching the games can be a little exhausting.
Trampoline offers you a resting moment for this.
Trampolin's heading up.
The aim is not to move forward.
The contestant rises up to a new rise, as if unweighted as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, this is not a lack of competition or difficulty, but during the programme there is no violent storm towards the end, no jumps into distance, just a sleepy, melting interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to the Zen space as you can get at the Olympics.
Women's competitions and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon at the start of the broadcast at 13.00 (ET), men's competitions will also come on Saturday at 13.00.
NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon software starting at 14 o'clock on both days.
In the middle of the Olympic drug they offer a quiet, charming moment, which is most likely not to be noticed in general chaos.
And if awareness is achieved only by offering male athletes to be stared and objectified (as the U.S. male gymnasts recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his prying new fanry.
"Growth points out" in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
The protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced the violent opposition of the government.
Witnesses say that dozens of protestors have been shot to death in conflicts with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally in the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country as it spreads more and more.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses said that the police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protestors.
The popular videos recorded in demonstrations, which are believed to be by the end of last year or from the beginning of this year, show how the security authorities are hitting young people with sticks while they were forced to stand against the wall with their hands.
The United Nations High Human Rights Authority is now calling for a comprehensive investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together, and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia, after Nigeria, is the second most populated country in Africa, and the Western countries value its stability.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country will get so much help from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital Addis Ababa has even a new train for business travellers.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model for democracy, human rights organisations have been constantly talking about the oppression of the government, the country's opposition has been limited and the dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this could be changing.
"If you suffocate people, and they have no choice but to show their opinion, this will happen", Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
The whole youth is showing his or her mind.
One generation points to their minds.
The complaints are diverse and cover everything from land use to the strangled grip of the ruling coalition.
After a lot of critical elections last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last opposition to hold, and now it holds all the seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border against Eritrea are growing. The battle along this tight and controversial border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogade National Liberation Front, which have been more or less over the past few years, may try to use the shock to exploit and rearm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of flooding under the surface, bitter emotions are about to explode.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years has a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more widespread and Internet service improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate the location via hidden network brokers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oroms and the Amhars, are getting along better.
The Oroms and the Amhars are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amhars, who come mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, succeeded in politics and business by using the ores, many of which are Muslims and who live in the lowlands.
But this is changing, too.
"We're on our way to organization under one umbrella," said Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Orom.
Many Amhars and Oroms think that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigre people. The people cover about 6% of the population and control the armed forces, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, former rebel leader, was the Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and to use secret ambassadors to make the opponents harmless.
"The current administration has no basic sense of that," said conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemaram Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknownly to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that security services controlled by tigers do not trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
For the last time, Ethiopia was in a state of such a quake in 2005, when thousands expressed their opinion on the elections, which according to analysts seemed to be the first time the government hurled and then robbed them.
In the ensuing effect, many protestors died, albeit less than in the last few months, and that period of restlessness passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new journey train, and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But this clearly has not stopped the inward contempt of the Ethiopian government.
And now it's getting a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked companies owned by Tigres, and anti-Tigre hatred is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the demonstrations put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American Government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to Somalia, a neighbouring country, even though it said a while ago that it closed this base.
Even though the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they do not want their unstable allies in the region to collapse.
"This," said Abdi, "there's a real balance."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama's fundamental father's "sharpism"
Donald J. Trump tried to stifle his latest campaign against the dispute on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when this week, on numerous occasions, he urged that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founders of the Islamic state terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly with the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who have worked hard to defend him during a stormy period, in a difficult position in which they must explain comments that he does not necessarily mean.
Following the suggestion made at the campaign meeting on Wednesday night, Trump said the same thing increasingly in his interviews on Thursday, in which he urged that he really intended to say that the President and Clinton created Isis.
However, in an early Friday morning Twitter publication, Trump said that he was just being sarcastic.
The publication was a complete translation of the previous day when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed a serious accusation.
When the conservative radio broadcaster Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his remarks by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate took this into his hearing ears.
The latest review storm comes in a situation where Trump has tried to refocus his campaign in the midst of the economic opinion polls.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to come back to the subject again.
I'm back on Twitter, he warned me that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
Later in July, when he was faced with a broad criticism, apparently when he suggested that Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his comments by saying 'I'm probably being sarcastic'.
The approach will allow Trump to go to the borders of political speech and then return if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He sees how they work and then 'clears' in the direction or depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to filter them through several different lenses.
Instead of mitigating his speeches for the great general public, Trump has been even more cumbersome in recent days when his popularity has continued to decline.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, published on Friday, showed that Trump is working a lot after Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
Although Trump is generally trying to avoid apologizing for what he said, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faced an ever closer examination during the last few months of the presidential election campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position in which they must publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
The former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, worked hard to defend the candidate at CNN’s interview on Thursday.
"I believe there are real, political comments in his words," Giuliani said when he was asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton set up an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost an unknown, small organization, which he called an amateur, totally wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most Republicans in the mainstream are trying to claim that the Obama government, where Clinton worked as Foreign Minister, allowed Isis to get worse because it failed to deal effectively with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania meetings on Friday, Trump continued to attack Twitter towards the news media, which are chewing on his every word and being partial to him.
He made fun of "sad, pathetic" TV experts trying to find out about him, saying, "They can't do it!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump’s excuse for new evidence that he was inappropriate for being president.
A previously closed cafe returns to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a cold, cash-friendly place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the streetside of Bedford Avenue was too expensive.
The store that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cup cake-shaped soaps.
The locals regretted it as the latest loss in a middle - class city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is devastated and Verb is now a soap store."
But if New York is a change, it's also reinventing.
The Revised Verb opened up in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile from its original location.
The new verb has a Wi-Fi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there is the same unpretentious atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The new verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the client offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used old Verb's lights.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try too.
He brought some new ingredients.
There are bacon egg cheese sandwiches on the menu, and the coatings include, for example, capers and brown onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but they make fresh juices.
In the course of nine months, Rodriguez says that he has noticed the old customers of a steady stream.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers too," he said.
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he went to the cafe.
He says when verb closed, he gave up on coffee for a while.
"I realized I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to the coffee, although on that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his regular ice coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been to Verb faithfully since 2003.
He used to go there before work, and he always made the same order.
"Every day fifteen more than seven, regularly as a watch, I went in and they were preparing the spices on bagelia butter," he said.
Photo, Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today Rosenthal is still making his usual order, but sometimes because of the variation, he orders a spiced bagel with bacon, egg, and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have a grudge for the soap store that took over the old facilities.
In fact, Soap Cherie’s owners offered to make a special soap for verb, which would be used as an ingredient for coffee-cold coffee.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish people of Greenpoint have also accepted a café.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to set it up soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-frozen coffee.
It is possible that the cafe will extend to the next building.
For many customers it is enough to get their old favorites in the new verb.
Joseph Whitt was a client, and he said it was unscrupulous when the place was closed down.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said that he felt like he was coming home walking in and ordering coffee.
"I've longed to smell it," he said.
A Square Metal: a depressed food of the recession
In March 1933, soon after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office.
The delicious direction of President Roosevelt liked sophisticated Fifth Avenue dishes, such as goose-painting, and Maryland’s sorbiter soup.
On that day, his diet was less modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato sauce, and dessert for plumming.
"It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity for people suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
A couple in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life in the Lower East Side building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest cooperation, A Square Metal, which Harper will publish on Tuesday, is the history of American food during the great recession of the 1930s.
By showing some kind of culinary solidarity, they meet the supplier at dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unpretentious lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been in operation since the fall of the 1929 stock exchange.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose with turkey, potato and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered the meat loaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating the recession.
"The troubles were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut mulch, liver mulch, bean mulch.
They were made of a material and some cheap ingredient that continued the substance itself.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they would form your dinner.
Coe smiled.
"It must have felt like a lot of lead in the stomach," he said.
In the years before the recession on American tables, especially in rural areas, it was like eating-so-so-so-long-so-long-down-table.
Women’s groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pies were served at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I. The Square Metal book crowned the ways in which the nation survived that it suddenly was no longer a country of abundance.
"Then food became a central, distressing subject for the Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
As distressing was a new, affordable diet: Mysterious foods, such as cans and boxes, became the main foods, and the box was "a powerful way to use food stars", mentioned Ziegelman, because the cooks were able to hide less attractive ingredients under the creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
The meat, which had been at the center of American meals for years, became a well - administered luxury product.
Special ingredients were tried with calories and nutrients more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
Ziegelman also prepared an age meal where roasted onions were filled with peanut butter in the study for a book containing recipes.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "It was unreal."
Peanut butter is in no way suitable for roasted onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, the head of the federal household agency in 1923-1943, guided the country’s eating habits more than ever before or after.
Public recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines they encouraged women to become "budgets" and to respond to the challenge of converting lumps like never-ending spaghetti and carrots into delicious doses.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical flavors.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's reaction to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's, let me eat your cake gun.
At the same time as publicly praising the simple, iowan country food of his childhood, he’s eating like a sophisticated millionaire who he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tuxedo on his head in an almost gold dining room.
He was so great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place "not only to offer food that belongs to Washington's furthest, but also to offer food that is least prepared."
Many of the depressed eating habits were abandoned as soon as the earth got back on its feet.
The legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they gained a better understanding of the eating habits of the mother of Ziegelman, for example, how she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "He even got people sick."
There was a windshield incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home — the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman said, adding that the general trick was to give a name that looks like modest recipes.
There was no cream foam in the dessert, just plums, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone poured their spoons in a sticky, brown glue.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe did it once, and he did it again.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "a little bit of cut walnuts could help."
The Gilead will be reimbursed for the cost of a lawyer in the fight against the hepatitis C patent against Merck
The U.S. engagement judge has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the costs of the lawyer incurred by it in the dispute against Merck & Co Inc, a pharmaceutical manufacturer for hepatitis C.
In June, Gilead was released from the 200 - million - dollar payments after they broke two of Merck’s patents relating to Gilead’s success drugs Sovald and Harvon, a release that followed when a U.S. judge found the abuses of Merck, including false oaths and other ethical practices.
In a judgment delivered on Thursday, U.S. engagement judge Beth Labson Freeman stated that Gilead was entitled to be exempted from the compensation it incurred in opposition to the action.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines, which can clearly cure more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case is due to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of the active substance sofosbuvir based on Gilead medicinal products.
U.S. supported forces say they've taken over Manbij, ruled by Isis.
The troops supported by the United States have taken over the northern town of Manbij, which is close to the Turkish border, since the last remaining Isis fighters left the city, said the group representative on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hidden in the city left it.
The troops had released more than 2,000 wing hostages held captive by the fighters, from Sharfan Darwish SDF, the Manbij Military Council, to Reuters.
"The city is in full control now, but we have begun to investigate it," he told Reuters.
Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2% of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax return showing that the democratic presidential candidate and his spouse's income for the year in question amounted to USD 10.75 million and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charities, mainly the Clinton Foundation, and former President Bill Clinton made almost $5.3 million in speaker compensation, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster in his book, which told about his career at the Foreign Ministry.
Clinton's vice president, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton published a 10-year tax return.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set a standard for economic transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in the opinion.
As a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
As a rule, US presidential candidates publish their tax returns, even though the law does not oblige them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have relied on the tax administration’s audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
"Your turn," Ian Sams, the campaign assistant at Clinton, said on Twitter when he published a link to the democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he wouldn't let Trump publish them until the audits were ready.
Trump's critics, including Presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican Members of the Republic of 2012 have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his contributions to charity, his business and many other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has taken up the problem on Friday with the release of an online video that brought out visible Republicans who are calling on Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every candidate for president of the last decades has done: he published his tax return," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the two 1990s, and the New York Times Business Colonist borrowed a number of tax lawyers and accountants who said that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named after the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At Clinton's meeting last week in Nebraska's Omaha, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway group is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he also has an audit of the tax administration, and that Trump does not "fear" the tax collector, but the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The actual federal tax rate for Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, was about 32% between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
Clinton’s tax return for 2015 showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment site was an affordable, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported a dividend and interest income of USD 109 000.

Chili powder condoms and shrubs enhance the elephant protection of Tanzania
Nature conservationists in Tanzania are using an unusual way to prevent elephants from roaming to human settlements - they throw condoms filled with chili powder.
The method has proven effective, and several years ago the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the United States Nature Conservancy, has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step approach to protecting homes and hundreds of animals without harming them.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the world’s elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"From the time we developed...tools, we have seen a change of attitude in these communities; they are now much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them," said Damian Bell, CEO of Honeyguide.
The first two steps include intruding elephant detection with a flashlight and horn-playing.
If it doesn't stop the animal, we'll throw the so-called "Cill Cloud".
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and soil and a twirl, and then the condom is wrapped in such a way that only the fuse remains visible.
When the condom is lit, it bursts and blows up chili powder dust into the air.
One odor is usually enough to send an elephant in another direction.
The last means is a trigger that blows up a Roman candle, a fireworks that produces a loud, bright explosion.

A French, Jewish-based filmmaker released the media storm after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list Israel’s directional number. According to the worker, this is due to the "requests" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made a Shoah documentary about the Holocaust, depressed his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in a German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find the Israeli hotel in the country's list of directions.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries that could be called directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through his own telephone centre.
When searching for an explanation, the filmmaker took the matter up at the hotel reception.
Mr Lanzmann wrote that the answer he received from him was "serious to him."
The hotel receptionist said it was a "considered decision of the Kempinski Hotel Management".
The reason behind the decision caused even more shock in the filmmaker.
"The biggest part of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's heading number," the employee is reported to have said according to Lanzmann.
Israel's German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case a "great injustice", Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
It is already a great injustice in itself.
But a greater shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need any explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident produced quite a counter-reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "giveed up" the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Fear," said another publication, which noted that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself denied all charges quickly and called what happened "inaccuracy" and "sorry" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"The clear order not to include Israel in the list of fast-elected elections was never made," said Kempinski's representative, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the heading number has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students
On Thursday, the students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, when the students met to protest against the reforms of the government’s public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to break down the student group, which led to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their horror at the plans.
According to Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, Governor of the State of Sao Paolo, less than 100 public schools would be closed down and 300 000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of those who participated in the demonstration were seen writing on the walls of the provisional anti - President Michel Temer.
This latest demonstration took place only days after the protesters took off as one group to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was arrested for the vote of the Senate of the country.
NT1 international trade NT1 international trade
Since the abolition of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, says the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagarya.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were removed, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in transactions in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties to Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Of course, one of the main objectives of Iran's bilateral cooperation is to expand trade," said Dzhagaryan.
He pointed out that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 % compared to the same period of 2015 by a total of USD 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose by 91.5%, with a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to $158 million.
"The growth of trade was achieved by the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
In addition, Dzhagaryan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Mission in Iran issued approximately 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens mainly for travel.
Iran was also for the first time among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia.
"It is safe to say that last year's record of Iranians in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, rather few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. They have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
The Scot Callum Skinner hit the finish line while the British caught the bike gold.
The Scottish Callum Skinner praised the men's team print at the Rio Cycling Stadium last night when the British team's three-way team defended their champion from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was anchored in the role of his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy, the legend was proud of the young man when he reached the finish line, taking the victory out of the pre-favour of the New Zealand team.
Britain took the shock win four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the tempo after being modestly sixth in the March race world championships in London, even though Hoy has since finished his competition career.
The problem between the Beijing-London competitions was the replacement of a special messenger Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's ending also created a vacuum that Kia Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man of whom British trainers held onto the potential in Scots, which is now understood.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner took the Olympic record at times, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel of gold.
Hindes was right behind him after his own tour, but Kenny pushed the team, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a major part of the transformation, and included Hindes driving at a bigger turn to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to stick to the pace.
Hoy followed his position as an expert at the BBC and drew Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' attention as they entered the award height.
A 23-year-old Glasgow Skinner said, "Verting is flattered."
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
We made an Olympic record at the final and won the world champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindies admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments, and British competitors have not complained.
This time, there was no similar problem with overwhelming profit.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London with so many British flags on my foot."
As a team, we found contact during the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympic Games again is simply wonderful.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven out of ten bikes in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we will be waiting for a successful five days at a cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny's condition, it's not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's rouble, winning three Olympic gold at the Olympics.
That would mean that Kenny, exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on 23 March (it seems to be a sacred day in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister), would rise to six gold and one silver medals.
It'd be the same as Hoy.
Kenny will be competing next in a sprint that starts today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this one.
The team race is always the best.
We're gonna win it together with the guys.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the value of the knight."
This was the only medal competition today, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were the fastest in time in a four-person, four-mile team run.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record that won gold in London 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and finals (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the focus of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time he was driving when the officials invited him to the length test.
In a similar competition for women, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavie Katie Archibald made progress in the world record at the time of the stop at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great cycling team will take over the central part of the Olympic Games and reach the medals of the whole series.
After a truly exceptional and complete management in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced before the Rio Games.
There has been a drama in the background, the least of which has not been the difference between technical director Shane Sutton in April because of sexualism and temptation, and the end of the race of the greats, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night's competitions at the cycling stadium, it seems that the legendary reputation of Great Britain now rises to its peak at a perfect moment could be maintained once again.
Portland's unstinted future is questionable due to the cut-off of the electricity contract
The future of Portland's aluminium fuse, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain when the electricity company that distributes electricity to the factory revealed that one of the factory's owners is concluding a distribution contract, so it is expected that all distribution contracts will be cut.
The measure follows the decision of the Victorian administration earlier this year that the aid required to maintain the plant will not be continued.
The 20-year period will end in November.
Even 2,000 jobs could be in danger at the Alcoa Portland factory.
Even 2000 jobs may be in danger, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition, it can be possible to have a snowball effect, as the non-soluble uses about 10 % of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's meltdown, which led to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's meltdown loses money and is in danger of closure.
The measure is now following the speculation that has lasted for several years since the factory's future, which began as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently been the result of the price of its production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium alloy from the Loy Yang An plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it also expects three other owners to conclude their contracts.
Most of the factory is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL looks forward to the continued operation of Portland's plant, which means that the unsmelling physical need for electricity will continue," he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called "protection agreements", which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a notice period of 12 months, so they will actually end in 2017.
"For this reason, AGL expects contracts to produce results in the financial year 2017," said the electricity company.
All possible outcomes for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong prospects of the wholesale electricity futures market.
AGL said that it has already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million, before the end.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to keep the melting active or to secure the supply of unsmelling electricity".
The US company said that it concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the agreement had to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew.
Analysts have been careful not only of Portland, Victoria, but also of the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, because the economic situation in the sector is poor.
Earlier this week, Stephen Mikkelsen, CEO of AGL, told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If both plants leave the market, this is a significant reduction in demand for [electricity].
For us as a power producer, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just the real Kardashian TV star, is on the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter, is on the cover of the September issue of the United States Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and modelled in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on Thursday in his Instagram account.
"Looking at this deck in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover publication was followed by a unique (or perhaps just Kardashian style?), a scripted reality video, where the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (except in the case of Rob and Caitlyn, and with whom everyone's favorite entertainment, the Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his sister's cover, but which ended up in the classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
This is the cliché of almost every children's "day of birth" series (Seacrest says the lines "I guess you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of a planned bunny in the morning), but Krisin had to make his other girls somehow benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved to the new Kardashian era with Vogue in September.
Kendall’s big sister Kim may have made Vogue’s claim first (who shared it with her husband, Kanye West in April 2014), but the issue of September is quite a category.
The number of Vogue in September is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee protocol than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (from Fashion it was calculated that 615 out of the 832-page study last year was advertising content).
For its cover, exposure is so much expected that for the last two years the pictures of the magazine have leaked before the official publication.
Previously, women on the deck have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelil, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "celebrity models" on the deck than "models that are famous".
The winner of the Oscars and Ambassador of Dior, Jennifer Lawrence, were in charge in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga's place of honor.
But if it happened that Jenner, pictured by the magazine as the "success model" of his generation, would hit the first category, he's in quite a good company.
These celebrities are not famous people's relatives or real stars or today's young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of this).
They are rightly gifted women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of his career with Lemonade's publication.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
His true-TV history will always have Jenner's position in the fashion world.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, criticised Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, calling them "the mother-in-law of this moment".
This feeling came back to the surface with Jenner's Vogue.
But running in dissatisfaction is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September number.
He's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He'll sell you Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters will sell you pictures of themselves in their own applications behind the payment wall.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter she took to the LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, he's a real-time TV star.
The Community's legal centres are turning 160 000 people away every year.
The most vulnerable of more than 160 000 people are turned away from the Community legal centres each year, as the sector prepares for the impact of further financial cuts on its already-prepared border operations.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair exodus and the like - are already turned away in search of free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already stretched to the extremes of the Community are preparing for further cuts.
In June of next year, these legal centres are scheduled to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Mr Farrell said that if the decision of the federal government is not withdrawn, the situation would only worsen.
"Queensland Community legal centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need every year," he said.
People who leave violent relations with uncontrollable and rambling debts, families in a separation, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not get the help they need.
The federal government is cutting funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable people in Queensland are forced to navigate in the middle of complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately withdraw these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government implemented its promise to increase the financing of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community legal centre and their customer communities, and the Palaszczuk Government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after the employee was claimed to be armed.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for alleged failure to do anything after being informed that the campaign manager of North Carolina threatened the employee with a gun in February while they were driving in Jeep.
The incident was described in the application lodged on Wednesday at the State Court of Justice by Vincent Bordin, former software trainee of the state's campaign.
My Bordini said that for months he waited for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized that 'it would not happen'.
Chief Earl Phillip "took out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pushed the pipe against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the application.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other persons had had similar experience with Phillip, said in the application.
"You don't have to fire weapons to cause damage," Bordini said in the application.
The challenge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told the public in North Carolina that "the people of the second addition" - usually involving the owners of arms and armaments - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and elected judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media has taken his word out of context and that he is not in favour of violence.
Bordin's challenge is to seek compensation from the campaign for negligent control and from Phillip for violence, abuse and emotional shock.
The representative of Trump, Hope Hicks, did not reply immediately to the request for a comment.
The attempts to reach Phillip were not successful.
WCCB, a local news company in Charlote, reports Phillip's recent departure from the campaign.
The request for a call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services was not answered immediately.
The campaign of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been controversial.
The case against Bordini is Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
The British must channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and prosperity to the whole stomach, not just local communities and different parts of London.
For me, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was also the charm of the London 2012 Games, when we went through a huge effort to ensure that all our peoples and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, 10 000 new trainees and 40 000 new jobs will be created and youth unemployment around the airport will be eliminated.
As before the London 2012 Games, some come to think that the challenge of extending Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the race and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012 and will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked to it.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and an economic growth of GBP 211 billion, both leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented an infrastructure investment programme of GBP 11 billion in time and in the budget: from T5, voted the best airport terminal in the world for five years in a row, to T2, which was built between the two most urgent runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to implement the third runway, supported by GBP 16 billion of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also a success.
It is time we channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow Board and former Trade Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse games on the prevention of ads
For companies that receive money from online advertising, companies to pass the anti-advertise program are "cat and mouse", said one of the companies that manufacture such a programme.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertising inhibitors from using its computer pages, Adblock Plus published a blog article saying that users can update the software filters to prevent ads on social network websites again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its website code will be changed around ads to make it more difficult for advertising inhibitors to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's passed the new code.
In a blog article, Adblock's representative Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-to-back struggle between the open source advertising community and its tourers has been going on since anti-advertising advertising was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the great grief that advertising inhibitors have become to industry.
Globally, some 200 million users of advertising inhibitors are reported in last year's Pagefair and Adobe survey, which is almost four times the amount that used these programmes in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenues.
However, the company is after anti-promotionists on computer pages, as mobile ads do not work on Facebook mobile applications for social networks or Instagram, said the representative.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue to make Facebook think this type of activity worth investing.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said that it would update its "advertisement tool" to give people more power over how advertising is targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that the new Adblock filters were worrying because they would also prevent some of the website's non-advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," Facebook representative said in an e-mail opinion.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we are focused instead on building tools like Ad Papers that provide control to people.
Apparently, she got hit by a car on the Swiss motorway because of suicide.
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses after a woman on a freeway under several vehicles in the early hours of Thursday, in a case apparently suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 road near Morges in Vaud's canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did an "unsatisfying act" and lay in the dark on the road where several vehicles hit her, said the Vaud police in the statement.
The victim who clearly tried to kill himself was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the event have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, reported the police, who are calling on them and all the witnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
The criminal investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in a situation like this, according to lawyer Gilles Hofstitter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
"However, it remains to be seen whether any of the involved drivers will be prosecuted.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It remains to be settled by the D.A.," said Hofstutter.
Two similar cases over the last five years indicate that drivers are not held liable.
In both cases - where both had a person walking on a dark motorway - it was estimated that drivers could not expect to meet a pedestrian on a freeway in the middle of the night, said the magazine.
Last year, the police were released from charges of negligence after he hit and after killing a man lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out, they told the court.
The Court stated that the police, which was responding to the emergency call, were driving in a justifiable way, and that the presence of a man in the road was 'a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation', the judge said.
Anyone who has information on a case near Morges on Thursday should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus had to live once
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was likely to have to live once.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus would have been hot, anhydrous with its surface, and if CO2 was to be filled with aerial development, it could sometimes have been a terrestrial situation.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus’s slow speed explains its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere, and still could have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the early surface formation of Venus.
The planet probably had drier areas than Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variation to enable life and to protect from rapid water evaporation.
The advantage of early Venus was also 30% darker sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the sun for almost two months at a time," explained GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in the news release.
This warms up the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of cloud that acts as an umbrella covering the surface for a large part of the sun's heat.
As a result, the average temperature in the climate is actually a few degrees colder than the current temperature on Earth.
The model produced a story about the development of Venus, which is similar to that previously assumed by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was likely to have to live at times, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapours burned in ultraviolet light.
As its hydrogen escaped, only the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with its deadly greenhouse gas phenomena remained, Venus, which we know today.

On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from the activities of the Colorado Avalanche coach and the Deputy Director-General for hockey, which is the reason for the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
The Vice President/Chairman of Colorado, Joe Sakic, confirmed the information and noted that the team would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have done my duty as Deputy Director General of the Colorado Avalanche hockey business, as chief coach with zeal, passion and determination," said Roy, 50-year-old in the opinion.
During the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the view of the coach and the vice-president of hockey matters must be fully in line with that of the organisation.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
The Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization and wish him happiness in the future.
Roy was appointed the winner of the Jack Adams Award to the best coach in the League during the first Avalanche season 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the central division to victory, but in the first round of Colorado's playoffs, the team has not been able to continue in the last two years.
Avalanche’s games in 2015-16 ended with 39 wins, 39 wins and 4 games, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing the wild card slot of the Western conference.
The goalie Roy, elected to Hall of Fame, won four Stanley Cups - two in Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
The labour struggles of oil workers in the North Sea are delayed due to wages, when all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
The oil field service company Wood Group has been randomly organized on the North Sea drilling boards led by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group, as well as Unite and RMT Unions, can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process of resolving the current dispute", read in the joint opinion.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several meetings all day early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent work struggle, which they say will be the first in over 25 years, was an objection to possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group cut the North Sea contractors' fees by about 9 % due to negative market pressures.
The reduction in the remuneration of the company will result in a 10% reduction in the number of contractors in its countries from 2014.
The company said that further cuts would give the company the necessary room for manoeuvre to cope with the decline in the market.
On the other hand, Shell has reduced thousands of people on its payroll and announced its plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, as a result of its massive merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by the British June decision to leave the European Union.
The Scottish Member, Dave Anderson, met with allies earlier this week in order to discuss one of the generation's biggest labour disputes in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea is essential to the economy of the region.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just for the few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said in the opinion.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than USD 1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average of the previous five years has been around USD 7 billion.
Kepler is measuring the speed of the stars in the Pleiade star range
The most recent task of Kepler Spaces is to help astronomers collect the most complete list of the speeds of the stars of the Pleiadies.
New data will help astronomers to understand why the starry stars are spinning at varying speeds, and how the orbiting times are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will learn more about the relationship between mass, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Pasadena Centre for Infrared Processing and Analysis of Caltech in the press release
The star band of Pleiades is located 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the stars of the crowd were born some 125 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They're running at the top level right now.
At its peak speed, these adult stars rush large amounts of the star wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, its speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by monitoring the appearance of identifiable star spots, such as sunspots.
The most recent list of star speeds indicates that the more massive stars run slower than the less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars with dancers, bigger ones making devils slower than smaller ones.
"Plejad in "the ballet" we see that slow cyclists are usually more massive, while the fastest cyclists are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the Plejad starry is so close, it is the ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing the characteristics of the stars at the speeds of rotation.
"The starry crowd of players offers an anchor in the theoretical models of stars, which include both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn from how, because and why the stars slow down their speed and so to speak hang their 'dance shoes' on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the speeds of the Pleiades in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
