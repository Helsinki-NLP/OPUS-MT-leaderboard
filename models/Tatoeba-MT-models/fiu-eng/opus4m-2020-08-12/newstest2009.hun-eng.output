The Prague Stock Exchange at the end of the trade was negative.
The Prague Stock Exchange has corrected its losses after the crash in the morning.
Transactions with the shares of the Czech Energy Company (ČEZ) amounted to nearly half of the usual daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its fall on Monday when it dropped almost six percent from the beginning of the Tuesday trade.
This time, the fall of Wall Street shares is behind the fall.
This is how the market reacts to the vote of the American House, which refused to support the stability plan for the financial sector there.
Falls in shares in Asia
The Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall in shares on Tuesday, although the indicators during the day some of the losses were eventually cancelled.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange Index described almost four percent during the trading process, but later removed part of the losses and reduced the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index dropped 3.8 percent on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and markets were closed in Shanghai.
Sydney's stock exchange lost more than five percent, but ultimately losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the index there, dropped 3.6 percent.
"The timing of the U.S. rescue operation is uncertain and affects the world's financial markets," noted Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Central Bank of China.
In Hong Kong, the interest rates are the same as those of the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the US legislators should resume negotiations immediately and accept the proposal for support for the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a threat that other countries will also feel the consequences.
Bloodbath of U.S. shares
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the draft financial system support for which it would have been worth 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion kroons).
The legislators therefore ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the economy as a whole.
On Monday, the American shares had a bloodbath and the leading stock indices recorded the biggest fall in 20 years.
Dow Jones has fallen almost seven percent, and has suffered a similar fall in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but once it turned out that the proposal was not adopted in the House, the index began to fall.
Congress resigned: The U.S. government can pump $700 billion into the banks
The main heads of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader agreement and financial assistance to the American financial system.
They will vote on this in the beginning of next week.
U.S. legislators have reached a breakthrough in the negotiations on the approval of the emergency plan in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system worth $700 billion (about $12 trillion).
But there's no victory.
The Congress must complete some of the details of the agreement before they can disclose the final form and vote of the law.
The draft financial system will be discussed at the Chamber of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, the Reuters News Agency was informed by Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee of Financial Organisations.
According to Senate sources, the draft is likely to be voted on as soon as possible on Wednesday.
According to economists, it should be announced that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in the recovery of financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, there will then be a "braining".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step.
We have resolved our differences of views on the form of the package to stabilise the market," mentioned Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg Agency.
He said that the final vote could take place on Sunday.
The legislators met with Henry Paulson, American finance minister on Saturday night to give the government fund a final form.
This should buy out unsold mortgage assets from financial companies, which put financial companies at serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
"We are in the middle of a final agreement on a draft that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue the repair, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
Marking asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are therefore trying to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before trading on the Asian financial markets, where Congress's decision to trade on Monday would be the first to influence the time zone.
However, for the time being, it is not clear when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, nor will it be possible for the trial to fail at the last minute because of any problem.
The legislators hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is going through a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the scheme shall be divided into two parts.
According to President Bush's request, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, Congress may block the issue of the remaining amount, which was set at an additional USD 100 billion and subsequently USD 350 billion if it feels that the programme does not perform its function.
Bush assessed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may overjudge its veto.
However, despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme was to obtain financial instruments for the acquisition of the bad mortgage securities that lost their value, since hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to repay their mortgage loans.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Senator Judd Gregg.
The progress made in the negotiations is also satisfied with President Bush's satisfaction.
Tony Fratto, spokesperson of Bush, said that the president was satisfied with the progress made on Saturday and assessed "the efforts made by the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of bus and coach payments
Christopher Dodd, President of the Senate Banking Committee, who was in the negotiations, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of discounts, and the timing of the draft financing.
The new law also restricts the so-called bus payments of the directors involved in the programme and establishes a committee for monitoring the fund.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and that will be useful for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also includes assistance to homeowners who have problems with the payment.
The government should conclude new instalments for the mortgage it buys, with a view to reducing the monthly instalments of the debtors and enabling them to keep their houses.
Marek: Spiritual Aid
The draft proposal, David Marek, is a good idea, according to Patria Finance's leading economist, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"It's all because there's no way to know what kind of mechanism they're going to buy out the problem.
This will be crucial to how the financial sector and government divide losses among themselves," said Marek to the iHNed.cz website this week.
According to Marek, it is not so important that the plan is approved now or early next week.
"It is much more important that the Congress decides this week that the plan will be supported and as soon as possible will be blessed.
The importance of the spiritual agreement that the plan should be approved is the most important thing at this moment," said Marek.
Double battle blade: MP3 players versus mobiles.
We help you choose
While almost all mobiles are capable of playing MP3 files, no MP3 players can be called.
That makes it clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why you need to get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the way in which it is used and on the needs of the prospective owner.
It's probably hard to get home a high-quality expensive record player to listen to that latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on bakelite plates, but there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if its shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues bakelite discs, it is likely to dream of such a disc player.
This is similar to travel, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
It is unacceptable for some to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan is likely to accept a 20-coron market earphone.
Two extremisms, where everyone has enough space.
It's a wide choice.
Lifespan of batteries also counts
Some top-quality music players can do much more than play music easily, but also what most mobiles do not by chance.
None of these devices are as universal as the phone.
Besides the primary features, phone and texting, you can play music and video, record both, have a better, worse camera, and even navigate.
And when we consider the smartphones and communicators, he'll have a little computer in his pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can take pictures.
Multi-functional cell phones have disadvantages, though.
The more features you use on your mobile, the more features the display sends to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, mostly less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For this reason, count on cheap cell phones that they won't play for you for more than a few hours.
If you even call here and there, get another charger for safety at work - that applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will not have such a problem, even worse ones can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation with a charge.
The next problem arises when you upload music to your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can cope without the adapter with the miniature memory cards used in mobiles.
With some exceptions (iPod) players do not need any special software.
Enough to charge the device from the computer with music via USB.
The majority of mobiles and players are already creating their own music directory, which is organized on the basis of the artist's name, album, genre or user's evaluation.
Some devices only represent a wooden structure like Windows Explorer, and they both know it (iiver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with an operating system).
Players are easier to manage, mobiles know more
For the selection of specific equipment, you should be interested in the lifetime of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and type of audio output and, of course, the comfort of the treatment.
If the music serves you primarily as a background and listens to you on the tram for a short period of time, for example, any mobile playing MP3 will suit you.
And that's what any cell phone can do.
You don't have to pay particular attention to the music formats of your mobile or player.
All MP3s will be able to cope, and the vast majority of music coming to you will be in exactly this format.
MP3 is one of the most widely used and the vast majority of devices can also cope with WMA format music.
The AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod) is less likely to occur.
Better mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy online music.
It is enough to visit the appropriate pages of the service provider (or other service provider) through the mobile internet and to buy the song or album.
This service itself can be a strong argument for getting a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the supply of service providers is poor and generally limited to single radios.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it can be assumed that music will control the music industry in the future, whether it is through GSM, the Internet or the wireless Internet.
The majority of people keep their cell phones all the time.
Any time you want to listen to something, your cell phone's in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player is at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry earphones or at least the speakers.
If not, you can use the built-in loudspeaker, which has almost all mobile phones, but only a few MP3 players.
Many people will probably have the greatest advantage of music mobiles.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
You can get a decent walkman between three and four thousand crowns.
Mostly, however, you are limited by the lack of conventional earphone output.
The best and most technically equipped phones can reach 15,000 kroons with traditional earphones with a diameter of 3,5 mm.
At the same time, the advantage of players is, among other things, simple manageability.
The simplest – in no way necessarily the cheapest players (see our selection) will be able to cope.
Minimum function, a treatment similar to a previous conventional tape recorder or Gramophone is obvious.
There is no risk of a collapse in the form of a mobile Internet accidentally turned on, nor of a huge account for data transmission.
Which device to choose
The cheapest cell phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have openings for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
With the right card, you will also have access to maximum two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Base types only support cards with a maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive know what to do with up to 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and even want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iivert.
Based on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you belong to more demanding students, choose special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, and the comfort of the treatment approaches the MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson is the most advanced in the sector, which has the same user interface as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above mentioned brands can provide the same service in the same price category up to 4,000 kroons, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will reach the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The Czech mobile market is relatively advanced and our service providers offer the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - the virtual service provider that forces the classic service providers to significantly reduce prices.
Maybe it won't be like this for long.
We have already written on the Mobil.cz website that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by ČTú, which drew attention to the fact that the price of texts in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in the other countries of the Union.
Following the last move of the European Commission to regulate roaming charges, perhaps there is a conflicting situation - the Czech mobile service providers will be cheaper than their domestic texts from abroad for some of their customers.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound controversial, since we have three mobile networks and our penetration is very high above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This is often agreed with the President of the Council of the Czech Telecoms Office, Pavel Dvoňák, who has previously said a few times that there is no newer service provider in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the classic service provider is unlikely to have too many chances with its own network (although it would probably be difficult to find a frequency already).
But there is another option - the virtual service provider.
It was the move of virtual service providers to the mobile market that led to a significant fall in prices, which would then have had to be responded to by classic service providers.
Meanwhile, even before the big fish entered the market, sounds like ours were heard in Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile Great Britain.
However, it has been demonstrated that such service providers have a place and can indeed be successful.
However, we do not have to go too far for an example.
This February we briefed you on the launch of the Mobiling Virtual Service Provider in Poland.
In less than six months, this service provider was able to obtain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest service provider there.
In the meantime, behind Mobiling is the Penta Financial Group, which also owns the U-phone in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much narrower target group.
Effective operation requires much less customers than the traditional service provider.
It does not entail relatively high costs of construction, mobile network operation and maintenance.
Virtual service providers in the world thus usually appear at low cost - offer cheap calls and text messages, which are often offset by fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers at least 50 percent cheaper text messages than its competitors.
But as shown by the example of Mobiling in Poland, it is a pretty good move for a target group.
This service provider focuses specifically on men.
"The real men choose the Mobiling service provider - who they like to trust," says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobil Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual service provider.
It's hard to tell if an idea like that in Poland can work with us.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesperson of Vodafone, doubts about this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which the majority of virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfied with the provision of services."
In the Czech Republic, it is impossible for mobile operators to claim
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobiling.
"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic, the negotiations do not seem very hopeful.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our region," said Jana Studničková, spokesperson of the Penta Financial Group in her phone interview with Mobil.cz.
By doing so, it demonstrated that the existing mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not too much in sympathy with this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do their utmost to prevent any potential competition from being created.
The GTS Nevera Group has for some time been hiding its interest in the launch of the virtual service provider, which therefore intends to take another step towards making Telematica O2 a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in providing not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
The sooner the better.
We have once again discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, the spokesperson of the group.
Maybe now's the best time.
From informal information, we seem to be lucky for the first virtual service provider by the end of the year.
But his birth is surrounded by the wall of impenetrable silence.
"In this moment, we do not believe that a fully-fledged virtual service provider would have a place in the Czech market.
Contrary to the other markets, the Czech market is very special.
So far, we have not been invited by a single subject offering a complex and serious project in this area," mentioned Vlastimil Sršeň, Telefónica 02 Press Department to Mobil.cz.
The special situation of the Czech market is also referred to by the other operators.
Martina Kemrová, T-Mobile's spokesperson, exceptionally agrees with O2: "So far we have not registered any viable and bilateral business projects that could be further founded on."
And he added, "The T-Mobile network is unlikely to show up at the end of the year with any virtual service provider.
At this point, we should have a specific agreement on our table so that we can think so in the short term."
Vodafone’s attention is more focused on meeting its 3G licence requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiation with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most cost-effective for our clients.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to partner in the construction of high-speed mobile internet-sharing networks."
Responsible offices - a string with service providers
The procedure of mobile operators is easy to understand, and the entry of another provider would lead to an increase in competition, a reduction in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for us to enter such a competition?
When service providers are able to cooperate, they are also able to testify about the u:phone being born.
The highest pressure on ČTÜ is likely to be around the birth of the U-phone of the T-Mobile company.
This is evidenced by publicly available information on the ČTU website.
But right now it's on the U phone as a good reason why we don't allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: "The environment of competition in the mobile market has recently been affected by access to the fourth mobile market.
Given the nature of the Czech mobile market, it is obvious that the entry of another player into the market and its services would be subject to high requirements."
However, given the attitude of mobile operators, the total lack of interest of the Czech regulators is absolutely amazing.
In the meantime, it is not only about ČTU's attitude, which unfortunately, in the Czech Republic, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, has no right to intervene in economic competition.
Only the Economic Competition Authority has the right to do so.
However, the Office is typical of the whole problem.
"The entry into the mobile market of a virtual service provider would only be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider for the leasing of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, since the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for traditional service providers," said Kristián Chlapua, in response to our question about the External Relations Department of the Economic Competition Agency.
A statement made by the representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from an agency which should represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, be careful not to allow anyone to recover from their market situation, it is more than strange.
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual service providers generally operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to the reduction in the price of mobile phone services."
However, UOHS's interests are likely not to be affected by the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices.
In this case, it is indeed shocking that the reaction of the three mobile operators is a very tangible line.
The question is, is it really just a coincidence? It's almost self-evident.
As in the charging stations, the exact same fuel prices are probably just the works of chance and hard competition.
"The Office has not discovered the signs of anticompetitive proceedings in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the service providers has a leading position, i.e. a proportionately higher responsibility for market facts.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market for virtual service providers are likely to be lacking by the telecommunications regulator," said Chalupa.
The presentation of the market leadership situation is one of the many points of debate.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTú, on the basis of which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
There is, of course, no Czech service provider in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different approach - the creation of a virtual service provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile service provider, relatively logically, has a monopoly on its own network.
So it is necessarily dominant in a particular segment.
But even if we did not accept this argument, it should be minimal for UOHS to have three mobile operators act in a similar way.
Meanwhile, complaints from interested parties (including the previously mentioned GTS Nevera company) show that they face very similar obstacles during negotiations with all service providers.
And putting responsibility on ČTú is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which the UOHS will take his hand off the whole matter.
We've seen this in a few similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, the extension of the mandate of ČTÜ in the field of economic competition could not be achieved in telecommunications, although many experts hoped to improve the situation.
The UOHS representatives need to know this well, but they probably have different interests.
It works when no one's watching.
At the same time, the operation of some kind of fake virtual service provider remains unnoticed, many of which are already operating in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that issue their own mobile phone service price lists, but which are only partially public.
It's multilevel marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the selected ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic corporate customer against the provider, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a prominent customer, you will receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that all Czech mobile operators are prohibited from making similar reservations.
"If there were cases of breaches of the terms of the contract that we would be dealing with and which could lead to the end of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrová answered our question about this problem.
But it is unlikely that the news of such activities would not have reached the people responsible for mobile operators.
In particular, thousands of customers may be involved in the three companies mentioned.
At the same time, no service provider defends against such a procedure.
These companies have non-minor profits and, unlike the real virtual service providers, do not, in particular, threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns against possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card is not listed on their phone, so they cannot have it fully as general customers of mobile service providers."
But at least that's what ČTú should be weird about.
In addition, another question arises for UOHS.
If mobile service providers ignore a similar procedure, why do they prevent the birth of a virtual service provider?
It should be added that the UOHS has relatively strong powers to reveal such activity and, if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that they did not suspect such a thing and that their trading conditions prohibit it.
♪ When we don't get the most expensive ♪
As has already been said in the text a few times, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has led to a appreciable reduction in the price of services.
In the meantime, in virtually all countries where virtual service providers were established, classical service providers have tried to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, perhaps too satisfied, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in the developed countries, regulators intervened at these moments, which in no way protected the interests of mobile operators, but of their customers.
Then, either by formal measures or by informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual service provider followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are giving the whole thing to each other.
Based on our experience, we can't get rid of the impression that their unclear competences are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is very soon present, the Czech mobile market may start to move again.
If one of the service providers would allow the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the UOHS would only be difficult to be indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps, compared to the rest of Europe, we will no longer make more expensive calls.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Select the Best
Listen to four new versions of the Czech state hymn.
On Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the state hymn on the Czech State Day.
The hymnst was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the leadership of Jiří Bàlohlavek.
Four versions are available - with male or female solos, vocals or instrumentalities.
Kateňina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The authors of the amendment of the hymn Otokar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz website.
The Czech national song is considered to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
He told the Czech Radio earlier that he deliberately chose young, representative singers to sing the songs, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to look after both of them, and later at the band, I tried to make clear diction, to understand the text and to ensure consistency," he said.
The Czech state hymn celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where Is My Country? was first played in the Rent Theatre in 1834 in the song Josef Kajetan Tyl Fidlovačka, supplemented by the music of František Škroup.
It became popular, and people considered it to be theirs spontaneously.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the state hymn after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
Even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic, one of the seven state symbols remained.
How's the "new" hymn
The Prague Transport Company also delivers chips for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, 1 October 2008 sign in to the history of the Prague Transport Company when the first passenger enters the metros, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper line.
The coupon is currently available for about 100,000 people with the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupons (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and can also save their chips at the information centers and offices of the Transport Company at the metro stations of Muzeum, M.Stek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons can be purchased online from yesterday via the Transport Company www.dpp.cz website.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who start using Internet commerce can ultimately forget the publishing windows at the metro stations, where they have had to make regular lines for tickets.
The coupon can be purchased over the internet and stored on the Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers have a counter with trained servers to help interested parties buy online and save their purchased coupons on their cards," said Martin Opatrný, the project coordinator.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can be saved to the Opencard in the self-service machines provided in some halls.
What do these machines look like?
Red, reminds me of the ticket operators, and the passengers may already have noticed them at Roztyly, Budějovicka, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but it should be 80 by the end of the year," added Opatrný.
The coupon checks automatically instead of the driver
It's easy to handle machines that start tomorrow.
It's enough to just insert the Opencard chip card and the coupon you paid earlier will be saved by yourself.
The electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital from tomorrow, but also in its vicinity.
So on trains and bus routes around the city, from 300 to 499, with which the residents of the Central-Czech tours mainly travel to the capital.
"On the Prague Integrated Traffic trains, the guide has been provided with card readers to help establish the zone validity of the coupons," explained Philip Drápal, who has prepared the Prague Public Transport Agenda.
In the buses around the city, the card readers at the driver's office are built in the cash register.
The driver must therefore not only show the chip card on the way in, but also place the Opencard in the location specified on the cashier's side.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"If, for example, the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, it is easiest to ask the driver to do so," Dravel added.
Passengers who do not travel by bus around the city and who will not remember when their coupon expires can once again go to self-service machines that save coupons.
The information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the equipment.
The Sudanese wanted a referendum from the United States.
The Sudanese Germans asked in 1945 for the addition of Shumava to the United States.
This is revealed in the letter from the South Czech Scientific Library collection.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
According to this request, in 1945 some German groups of Sudaneses approached the President of the United States.
This can be seen from a private archive that is now held in the collection of the South Czech Scientific Library.
In the letter, the Germans in Česky Krumlov ask the American President not to allow the return of the "Shumava county" to the Czech Republic, which Hitler has taken up under the Munich Treaty.
"We have correctly interpreted the situation, and we really want to be sure of the words that the American troops are certainly not coming to the German territories as a repressive and enemy, but as a liberator," it says in the letter, "Members who wear the fate of Šumava in their hearts".
Since the annexation of Czechoslovakia to the Sudanese Germans is said to be a hope only for brutality, insufferability, not for understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over Šumava the protectionate for "now and forever".
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million people, this area would be regarded as a foreign country for us, which suppresses and overthrows the minority, and it would do little to contribute to the victory of the allies," says the letter.
The reason the authors couldn't sign is because they claimed to be afraid of the revenge of the "Czech suppressors".
Thus, if the President of the United States were to doubt the Germans' opinion, it would be sufficient to give a referendum in the county of Shumava as to whether or not their residents wish to become part of the United States and whether they wish to live under the US Patronisation.
Although the text of the letter may seem a little naive in the current knowledge of postwar history, according to some historians, it adequately reflects the expectations of the Germans in Sudan at that time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to give the slightest idea that they would be deported from the country, the possibility of this was recognised by few of them.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would agree to a form of autonomy for the Sudanese people.
Others again trusted that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in České Budějovic.
During the war, Chalupa served as a German in the Navy in the Baltic Sea.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and put him in the Holštynsk prison camp, dozens of other Czechs came to teach him Czech.
"They trusted that when they returned home, the Czech language would be good for them," said Chalupa.
According to him, no one of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war was expecting to be deported on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
You don't think, you pay!
Emotional campaign against leaders
In Czech history, the most expensive operation for road safety.
The emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday would still be typical.
The office of Minister Aleš Łebíček from this campaign hopes to deter leaders from the dangerous conduct behind the government.
The 150 million-dollar campaign will be on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on flyers.
The leaders should be alerted to speed and alcohol.
And you should also remind them to put on their seatbelts before they leave.
In particular, young drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians, and not least professional drivers want to talk to their consciences.
And what appears in the ads?
Emotional stories, mostly human stories.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think, you pay!
The term "don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
And there's the word "pay" in the blood pool.
This must be a symbol of the fact that a person can pay for a moment’s indiscretion with his life.
The viewers will be "scraping" by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the English Saxony countries, where dramatic images of the victims of accidents can be seen regularly.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and the number of dead on the Czech roads.
The advertising sites were prepared by the Euro RCCG agency.
Pull it, let the drivers drive it
"The driver's system of pull it, let it go" is valid.
It's "let them go" when, for example, they go through the red, saving time.
'Draw' is the risk of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Koňána, psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need the information campaign in the press, especially the negative campaign, the psychologist thinks.
According to him, the driver's attention is less effective than the safety signs.
"If the hazard warning sign is fitted, it is likely that the environment will soon be connected and the leaders will not deal with it," warned Koňán.
He'd return almost all the occupied areas in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmer, President of the Interim Israeli Government, spoke of the return of practically all areas occupied in 1967, i.e. the west coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highlands, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview published on Monday by Jedi Achrono.
"We must agree with the Palestinians, which means that almost all if we do not have to return all of the areas (obsessive)," Olmer told the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any return includes East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, wants tractors and bulldozers not to cross his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, has to give up part of Jerusalem," said Olmer, referring to the attack on two cities in July, during which some people were killed and a few dozen injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution for the Temple Mountain, sacred and historical places in Old Town.
"He who wishes to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This won't work," he stressed.
Out of the Golan plane
He also expressed an opinion on the Israelis' withdrawal from the Golan Plain, which he felt was an essential condition for the peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require a certain effort from Damascus.
"I do not recommend peacemaking with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians well know what they have to give up in order to get Golan.
They have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they have to give up their relationship with Hezbollahhal (Sicit Movement); they have to give up their regular support for the terrorism of Hamas (Sicit Movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (Sacred War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions after an accident: Is it illegal for passengers in buses?
The law doesn't know them. It's not allowed to walk on a long-distance bus.
Concerning the tragic bus accident of Student Agency near Padova in Italy, the question was whether passengers and passengers could travel by bus.
"If we are to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activities of the passenger attendant are contrary to the Transport Act," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, the death of a twenty - two - year - old passenger attendant was probably caused by the truck driver crossing the bus.
Unfortunately for the girl, she was sitting next to the driver at the moment, in the bus's least safe place, even though there were two more seats reserved for her.
The bus may crash or suddenly brake at the moment when the passenger attendant serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
It has a role to play in determining whether the bus has its registered office.
If the bus is not homologised, the passengers must sit.
The Student Agency's long-distance buses do not have standing positions, as confirmed by Radim Jančura, the company's director.
"We tried to find a solution to this with the Ministry, and at first passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this has been withdrawn and we have come to the conclusion that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey if they have their own seats," he said.
The law doesn't know the passenger guide.
"There is no clear legal persuasion about the role of passenger attendants - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of a vehicle attendant; it does not define its rights and obligations," says Hanzelka spokesperson less clearly.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, Director of the Road Transport Department, believes that the law deals with the problem properly.
"It depends on whether or not the bus's registration includes a standing position.
And it's over," he says.
Buses may be urbanised according to their distinction, where there are standing positions and restricted to maximum speed, and between city spaces and allowed higher speeds, and distances without standing and at the permitted maximum speed, with seat belts.
As on the plane, says the expert
Jaroslav Hośín, a transport security expert at BESIP, has no basic problem with the movement of passengers on board the bus.
"In the course of continuous progress, there is not much danger, we can compare the situation with the service on the plane.
I'm not sure when there's a turbulence and the flight attendant can hit his head."
"However, if the bus suddenly stops, its physical laws will apply.
Same as in city buses or trams.
The safety of passenger attendants must be solved by the carrier through internal rules," he says, and he also believes that the problem has not been resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to terminate services
Student Agency offers passenger assistance services as the only bus carrier.
He's employing 200 escorts.
The director doesn't consider their occupation to be risky after the accident.
"But as I have the impression that the occupation of passenger attendants is risky, I will also remove it.
Coffee and newspapers are available to passengers on boarding.
That would be cost savings," he says.
In its vehicles, Alexej Litvin, the Director of Asiana, justified the lack of cabin crews for safety reasons, operating a fraction of flights compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have any escorts, we're against that from the start.
Sooner or later this ends with some kind of fatal injury," he said to Týden.cz just a year ago.
An Unbelievable Tragedy
The company was killed by a two - year - old flight attendant in Plzeň, Naples.
The Slovenian truck was likely to turn out of the take-off lane and stop the bus route without using a direction indicator.
The bus driver suddenly tried to escape with a maneuver, but the right front of the bus crashed.
The fact that two reserved places for the holiday of passengers were sold is rejected by Jančura.
"These places can't be booked at long distances, blocked."
The company wants to sue the head of the truck.
By indemnifying the girl's family, the agency does not expect the court to rule, but it also expects financial compensation from the offender.
Amendment of law?
In the distant future
The clarification of the movement of passengers on board the bus could be the result of a change in the law, on which the Ministry of Transport’s 30-person expert group has been working for more than a year.
"However, the group has not achieved any concrete results.
Buses are not so much concerned with the maximum speed on the motorway and mobile use during driving," says Hośín expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of passenger attendants to be a fundamental threat to the safety of passengers," Hanselka concludes by saying that the control of bus and coach safety falls within the competence of the police and labour offices.
The dysseldorf hopes pass in Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB Board to the employees of the bank is not limited in the big words.
The merger between the units of the financial institution in Düsseldorf and the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt could be a "central capital market organisation of the savings fund group", says the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would take a long-standing "skilled block" into a business like this.
Such a relationship could give a decisive boost to further mergers in the regional banking sector.
This is the reading of when a board of directors intends to prove their ability to act in difficult times.
After all, there is still a huge pressure on the uncertain WestLB bank.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Service Supervisor, which has recently informed the Land Government of North Rhine-Westphalia that the deadline for finding a lasting solution is limited.
However, the subject of a kind of relationship between Deca-Bank and WestLB, which is famous for its investment funds, has long been a subject for savings fund customers, including in Frankfurt.
At the end of August, Franz Waas, the head of the Deca-Bank, informed us that the bank on Mainzer Landstraß and a Land Bank, such as Helaba or WestLB merger, could not see its meaning.
Nevertheless, Deka’s board of directors, one half of which is representatives of the Landesbanks and the other half of the savings banks, entrusted the board to negotiate joint business activities with WestLB.
In this context, the capital market business or certain parts thereof may be discussed.
The negotiations, however, have only just begun - the financial circles claim -.
The name Deca-Bank, one of the major employers of the Frankfurt financial sector, is not for the first time emerging from the consolidation of the savings fund sector.
In 2003, the Deca-Bank seemed to be joining Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba for a moment.
However, this triple alliance did not become anything.
The plans were barely made public; the Land Government of Helaba spoke against his interest in Helaba.
After that, the other two banks did not find each other.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead went to Stuttgart Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
However, again and again the idea of a relationship between the Deca-Bank and the Landesbanks was raised.
The last time, however, Günther Merl, President of the Board of Directors of Helaba, spoke against the plans for mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, the recognition of the need for the convergence of the various banks in the inter-sector is worth it.
The first link between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected after the county elections in Bavaria.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure on further mergers increases, potential partners may slowly run out.
In southern Germany, it could only be a younger business partner, although the financial crisis has been significantly better than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The merger with WestLB was ruled out by the Giroverband Hessen-Thüring in Helaba at the beginning of the year.
The NordLB's not going to be any better.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank fit together.
Merl stated in June that the German Savings Treasury and the Jewish Federation had not yet answered the crucial question of what business model the future of the Landesbanks should be guaranteed.
Finally, it is possible to cut up WestLB, which they do not want to see for themselves.
Thus, the letter of the board there states that they are certainly seeking a "full solution".
How this can be compatible with the merger of individual units with Deca-Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "Italy weekend"
It's the first time they'd ever done it. It's the third or fourth time for Luca.
But now Elena's here as her girlfriend, and it's all different, says Luca.
Behind them, behind the five-litre barrel with the Kaiser brand stands a strong bearded man, proving to some 200 people who travel to Oktoberfest the depth of the sounds he can draw out of his throat.
Elena gets Luca's face first, then she kisses him.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, from the bus parking lot near Puorta Nuova train station, four buses depart at 23.45 from "desinazione Monaco, festival della" with a destination, expected arrival at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly held for Italians, and only Brazilians travel in the fourth.
In one of the corners of the parking lot, the South Americans were already singing by their flag, they started celebrating during the night.
And so loud, that's not for the Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears long, artificial fur coats and wide silver-sleeved glasses.
He's been traveling to Oktoberfest for five years. He's only arranged three trips this year.
At night, in the middle of the day at the Oktoberfest, at 10:30.
The accommodation would just be an unnecessary expense, says Marco.
The journey costs 75 euros, including welcome Kaiser beer, accident insurance and German tour course, which was cooked in accordance with the Bajoran Beer Purgatory Act.
And the buses are already getting into the night on the highway towards Brennero.
No beer, not yet.
The bus will be quiet soon, the passengers will sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their strength.
They are taking a break in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on Highway 8, several Italian buses take a short break before Munich.
When Marco's group arrives in the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half a week as planned, there are almost 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco's holding another final briefing, presenting the war plan.
First: Everyone wear the yellow cap.
On the left side of it, the phrase "Oktoberfest", written with the letter "Oktoberfest", can be read with the address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiodo.it".
Second, "When the gates of the beer tent open, run," says Marco in the morning.
"Foot!" Reservation of places in the back of the tent and run.
"Not in advance, because we're stuck, and not on the same bench with all the yellow hats, but let's spread out in the tent."
The one-litre cup costs 8.25 euros, shouts Marco.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards that you've behaved well.
As soon as you leave your seats, they will be taken."
Third, "Be back here at 6:30 tonight", you understand?
And we're on our way to Wiesn.
On the way, one of the men ties yellow caps to trees, tablets, and even one of the big Bajoran parties' election posters.
You need to be prepared to retire.
It's the second weekend of the Oktoberfest, known as the Italian weekend.
There are no precise figures; they speak of 50,000 people who cross the Alps intrude into the beer tents, said to be ten percent of all visitors of the weekend coming from Italy.
The Munich police are confirmed by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers are helping the Bajor Red Cross, which, in their national statistics, takes the first place with some 200 medical care, before the Austrians (about 80) and the British people who are in need of the lowest level (about 60).
The Hofbräu beer tent is particularly popular among the Italians.
Sleepless nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed by the Federal Minister for Finance of Pier Steinbrück only last week.
It is a good thing that the politician used the word "relatively" and even said that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because that's what happened this weekend.
The real estate finance company Hypo Real Estate (HRE) in Daxon, Munich, received billions of loans from the German banking consortium to defend itself against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan subsidies would amount to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate must pay interest only on the portion used.
The money comes partly from private and partly public banks.
In the background, the Depfa subsidiary has losses.
According to a newspaper report, Depfa was lending money to long-term projects and refinanced himself to these for a very short term - which is no longer possible because of the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserves decreased by 95 per cent to EUR 2,37 million and the share of equity also moderately dropped from 1,6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current revenue and net income from cash transactions have fallen to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, with a fall of more than 70 % from credit claims and certain securities, and a fall of EUR 5 million from the liquidation of the provisions of the credit business.
Only due to higher revenues resulting from the reimbursement of the ex-depfa group's ex-post accountancy costs, as well as the reimbursement of the interest payments under the tax regulation and the sales to the group companies, the income deficit of 16% was relatively moderate.
After privatisation in 1990, the former state-owned banker was initially speculating corporate real estate loans, which were later separated at Aeral Bank.
Since classical public funding could provide little money, Depfa was more strongly involved in infrastructure projects and in private investors' and state joint projects (Private-public-partnership, PPP) and extended its activities internationally.
For the value of subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate has now to provide descriptions that have a "essential effect" on the performance of the group in general.
The fact is that no dividends were paid.
The dividend was reduced to one third by 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major public and infrastructure financeer since the reception of Depfa.
It is more dependent on interbank market refinancing than on other financial institutions because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of Lehman Brothers Investment Bank in the US two weeks ago, the lending of banks to each other has ceased as banks maintain their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets per year to refinance part of the Depfa loan portfolio - some EUR 50 billion.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered by the loan for a reasonable period of time, and the company is protected from "the influence of the currently largely inoperative international financial markets."
Other sources indicate that the funding will be provided by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, Georg Funke, President of HRE, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the financial markets for a reasonable period of time.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) consider that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now ensured.
This gives the Bank's shareholders and creditors hope.
But due to the dynamics and inestimability of the crisis, you cannot be certain.
It is not even inconceivable that funding is not to be fully used.
But the opposite cannot be excluded.
After Saturday's late-night news that the bank was still on the verge of bankruptcy, even the temporary rescue of the equal amount could not reassure the moods.
The share price fell by 75% to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, bond rates are pretty good.
While debt in the first place is scarcely variable, the exchange rates of the reversed bonds have fallen significantly.
The crisis is particularly affecting the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, in a way, the maturity beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds have previously seemed to be a speculative investment alternative, their valueability must now be seen as dependent on the stability of the international financial system due to the aggravation of the banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution took over the Depfa to almost house the crisis.
As long as the central banks, governments and business banks are still ready to support the system, they can start from the date on which the benefits are due.
Or it will happen where almost no one is currently afraid to hope that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in the light of the reports relating to partial nationalisation, the likelihood of a certain degree of certainty has now become merely a legitimate hope.
For long-term creditors, the decision can cause sleepless nights to be separated from their investment.
However, short-term investors may use the sale to provide a reserve for taxes on exchange gains in the coming years.
The secrets of Sylvana and the insider box
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to be introduced to the Tachibana High School on the first day of teaching, the girls start whining: The German girl is totally "avaí"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the mangaes in the new exchange student blog about Japan.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I'm so excited.
I was on my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo, towards Plankati, and travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone. Fortunately, I wasn't lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching is not taken as seriously as it is at home in Lower Saxony.
The students start to eavesdrop at eight o'clock until a short conversation starts with the teacher at eight o'clock at 40, the "home room".
But before the teaching began, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not the type to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had my school uniform yet, I've been wearing my housekeeper's old skirt, and I've been wearing a blouse, blue kneecaps, and black leather shoes.
So in this dress I stood in front of your catheter and tried to say everything correctly: "Sajonara, vo se Sylvana ..." - My name is Sylvan, I came from Germany, and my birthday is in a week.
At this moment, I was very happy that I had learned the language for two years.
All 31 girls whispered, screamed and waved, and I kept hearing the word "kavaí".
I've known that from my manga.
This belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls, and it means "sweet, sweet."
And then I came to my place quickly.
The girl sitting next to me smiled widely, and it was an honor to have the exchange student put up next to her.
The rest of the clock was quite calm, but when the bell sounded, they rushed regularly.
Everyone was talking and laughing and asking questions about a hole in my stomach - and it's quite difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
After the break, everyone unpacked.
My host made me a lunch like this - it's completely different from boring German ten-hour sandwiches.
I got spiced rice, little sausages, salad made from cucumbers and algae, fruit, and a kind of tofu roasted meat.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
Foods look strange, and they taste completely novel.
The fact is, it's all very good.
Yeah, well, maybe except for the salty plums, Brrr!
In Japanese schools, the inn is not just lunch.
A girl may give a boy her own handmade penthouse, especially artistically compiled - in the hope that she can get to know the boy more closely during the lunch break.
I read about this in my manga comic books.
I wonder if I can observe that here.
"Why Japan?" asked my friends when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
'Cause you're just charming me.
After all, I've been reading mangoes for years.
And to better understand comic books and the culture described in them, I began to learn Japanese at some point.
So it was absolutely clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and habits.
And they're very respectable here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of latest techniques and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is organized so well, I've never felt lost, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats have emotions, too.
Is that what this means?
Joseph LeDoux, a neurologist, is convinced that animals also have emotions.
But how can you examine whether they feel the same way when they behave like us?
In the "Edge" Internet magazine, scientists have been publishing their articles for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in one of its series looks at the answers to the question "What does it think is real without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far. It is true that we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that each human brain has the same basic configuration.
However, as we examine other species, and in general, we are dissecting the issues of consciousness, we arrive in difficult areas because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals, pretending to be dead, running or attacking.
People behave in a similar way, from which some researchers conclude comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to animals.
On the one hand, human-conscious circuits almost always contain the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and implementation/management functions).
This broad area is more advanced in man than in other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other organisms.
At least in the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as knowing who we are, or, in the case of design and decision-making ability, it is reasonable to assume that man is different even from the other primates.
Another dramatic feature lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since a significant part of human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
However, even if the language was not dependent on the knowledge, the language would certainly affect it, so animal consciousness, whatever it is, is likely to differ strongly from most of our consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine what other animals may be aware of.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and because of the special hardware, it is not possible to analyse it on the basis of our own experience, then your research poses serious problems.
Most of my discussions relate to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is probably more accessible to science.
Animal consciousness processes, regardless of their content, could be examined and this is exactly what happens in experiments for short-term memory of primates, in particular in the example of visualisation.
However, in this assumption, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick have also examined, they rely on the neural connections of the consciousness rather than the remote mechanisms: both can be the same, or not.
Interestingly, this assumption highlights the importance of the prefrontal cortex when visualization is established.
What is the result of this with regard to emotions?
I would point out that an emotional system, like fear, activates in a brain known to its own activity.
What we call "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we are when the activity (or consequences such as physical reactions) of the defence system localized in the brain takes on a work memory.
In this way, emotions are closely linked to areas of the cortex that are characteristic of the primates and especially man.
In addition to the language, the sense is divided into fine degrees, because with words and grammar, we can distinguish and categorize the conditions so that we can describe them to others as well.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that emotions come from simpler activities in the areas of brain cortex and brain stems, as well as from Jaak Pankseep, who, however, is more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can easily play a role in the overall emotions of species.
Clearly, I can't deny that, but I find it unproven.
Pancreat believes that what appears to be a fear in rats and humans is likely to be a feeling in both cases: How can rats and humans feel the same when they behave the same way?
A cockroach escapes in the event of danger, does he feel fear?
In my opinion, only similar behavior is not proof of the same experience.
Although the neurocomparison continues to help, rats and humans have similar brain stems, the cockroaches have no brain.
But the brain stem is responsible for emotions?
And even if this could be proven to people, how can we prove this to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
But I don't know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and languages), I'm researching the emotional behaviour of rats rather than emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is expected at the neural level if the same is measured in rats and humans.
Just like rats, I don't study language and consciousness, I don't know how they feel, because I don't know if they exist.
It may seem like a short-sighted attitude to others, but I'd rather move forward than keep falling into a wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of UEFA: Grace time for Poland and Ukraine
The Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister, Ivan Vaszjunik, announced that preparations would soon be under direct responsibility by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees confidence in Ukraine in UEFA's decision in Bordeaux, and the evidence that they believe that Ukraine, together with Poland, is capable of organising the European Championship," said Vaszjunik.
"This, however, does not mean amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun, and much remains to be done in both countries."
With regard to the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both host countries are lagging behind.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We need to work with a great deal of luck now," said Grigori Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Association.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us."
In Poland, they wanted to take even more radical steps.
Following a number of scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN Association, which was replaced by the independent inspector of Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the initiative of Mr Miroslaw Drzewiecki Minister for Sport.
There is a "serious danger that PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules", Drzewiecki said to the Polish PAP News Agency.
"We have assured Michel Platinum, President of the UEFA, that this will not adversely affect the preparation of the EIB in 2012.
It was only in the last season that several first league teams had to be classified in the lower class because of manipulation, and eventually the league had to be postponed.
The infuriated Dennis Quaid beats back
The actress wanted to advertise a new film, she was talking about her private life in the interview, and now she's in trouble with her ex-husband, and Ryan, a Hollywood-star, classified her ex-husband Dennis Quaide as a adulterer.
The One Who's Tingling And Retreating
The late rose war at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid's ex-husband: The two Hollywood actors fight a nasty fight in public seven years after their divorce.
And Ryan, in an interview with the American InStyle magazine last week, was the first to declare the reasons for the divorce: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, causing me a lot of pain."
And only after the divorce did Dennis find out how many women he cheated on him.
The psychic striptease was due to Ryan's new press work on "The Women", which tells a history of adultery.
Dennis Quaid was determined to respond to his call to an unfaithful husband: "Wrongly", the 54-year-old actor said to the newspaper "New York Daily News", "that Meg is bored and boring to repeat and spend the history of our relationship."
In addition, it's a shame that 16-year-old common boys, Jack, are repeatedly reminded of the many pains and changes caused by divorce for a child.
While Ryan has been alone since his divorce, Quaid has been remarried and recently become the father of a twin.
Therefore, his reply ends with the following page section: "My life will continue anyway.
I'm happy to know that I have a wonderful family where everything's all right."
Flight rates and hotel rooms are falling
In the first half of 2008, European airports and hotels were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, air travel in Germany was not less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of air travel and hotel rooms have once again become more favourable - this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed the first half of 2008 booking data and, after the first quarter price increase, found a significant price fall in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, accommodation has already become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities under investigation rose by an average of 6.9 per cent compared to 2007.
However, between April and June prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most clearly shown in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than a year earlier.
This is why the American Express sees it at the low dollar rate, which led to the "frequent travel of American tourists".
The fall in hotel room prices will have a greater impact on financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than on industrial cities such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
The 26.3% increase in hotel prices in the Norwegian city is a European record.
As regards the prices of flights, there was also an increasing trend in the first quarter.
Due to the increase in kerosene, passengers in the tourist class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and long-term flights with high fuel demand cost 29.2%.
Between April and June, the prices of tourist-class flights decreased by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first class, prices showed only a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March prices rose by 11.9 per cent and decreased by 23.6 per cent in the second quarter.
According to the study, the cost of domestic flights in Germany decreased by half.
On the one hand, the cause of the fall in prices lies in the moderation of economic growth - the company claims.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market has weakened.
On the other hand, as a result of the Open Skies agreement liberalising air travel between the US and Europe, the competitive pressure will be strengthened.
The tension is confirmed by the fact that airlines are cancelling their loss-making operations and many airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe, this affects 24 airlines.
A HSV 1:0 blood a Gladbach
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV was placed at the top of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a functioning team.
Kristoffer Klein zoom Deep air for the national selection Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player only got into the game late, and the lift was bounced back from the gate tree.
His exact message left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," she snuck Hermann Rieger in the corridor leading to the Hamburg arena cabins.
Not much has happened in the catacombs, the break has ended, and most people have been in their seats again.
Rieger was the physical therapist of the HSV for nearly three decades, and he enjoys greater authority than some of the gamers.
So you found your request for an interview at the competent place.
Assistant Cornelius Jol nodded and unanimously showed his thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, head coach in Hamburg.
His orders may have been similar to that of the second goal.
The execution of the order has been delayed.
"Today was not always a beautiful sight" - admitted Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt's idea of a looser one.
1:0 (1:0) are the result of Mladen Petric’s head of Hamburg (11); and the fact that the very weak Gladbaches were unable to hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," he added to Martin Jol.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 on Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the viewers celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena, and the table that appeared on the projector, which presented their team as the first class of the championship.
It's a birthday without a party.
"We know where to put it," said Marcel Jansen.
He believes that the intermediate certificate of the table indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of the HSV.
Although thanks to the late-commitment works of the team, thanks to the Brazilian Names and Silva, the Gater Petric and Jansen from FC Bayern, he's slowly finding himself, but he hasn't had a barbecue yet.
"We need more sense and action," claimed Jol.
After the fall
Wall Street is surrounded by fear.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package led Dow Jones to a temporary drop of 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss in his history within one day.
Later, the Dow got a little stronger.
At 20:30, the world's most important barometer on the stock exchange was good 5 percent and stood at 10.579 points.
The technology dealer Nasdaq dropped to 1548 points by more than seven percent minus.
The biggest loser of Dow at this moment was the American Express with a 14% loss, followed by the Bank of America with 12 percent.
There's not a single piece of paper that's been strengthened.
The Goldman Sachs Bank's shares fell by nearly 10%.
Only a few days earlier, the bank bought a stake in Warren Buffett's large investor.
In the context of the rescue action, it is planned to provide funds for the so-called suspicious mortgage securities.
However, the amount is not intended to be paid at the same time, but gradually.
In exchange, the State would receive shares in financial institutions, which would be eligible if the exchange rates were properly developed, reducing the burden on the State Treasury.
European and American and share prices in decline
Billions of aid to European and American banks do not dispel the doubts of investors.
Hypo Real Estate's stock price is falling, and it's taking Dax with it.
The US Dow Jones indicator is falling despite the rescue planned by the state of the money market.
The spectacular losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank pushed the German share indicator (Dax) deep into the negative.
Despite the rescue efforts of the federal government and private banks, the value of the property funder in Munich fell to its quarter, and the Commercial Bank weakened by more than 20 percent.
The Dax sane to the 6000-point limit and scored 5839 points by 3.7 percent minus.
Stock markets are on their knees around the world.
In New York, Wall Street was opened with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion rescue package will not be enough to boost the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trade, i.e. 3.3 percent to 10.809,25 points.
The American Assembly wanted to vote on the rescue plan and the Senate vote could take place on 1 October.
The other European exchanges have only one direction: in London, the FTSE indicator showed a 3.2 percent weakness, and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index dropped by 1.26% to 11.743.61 points after the initial increase.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell back 2.1 percent to 18.286,90 points.
The Indian Sensex indicator dropped 506,43 points, i.e. 3.9 percent, and closed at 12.595,75 points.
On the Mdax stock exchange, Arcandor’s shares weakened after the announcement of the capital increase.
Sal. Oppenheimer's private bank subscribed 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism group also stated that the shares of Thomas Cook were not sold.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
The dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
The experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity cannot be entirely correct.
The Ulysses space probe has been flying in space for nearly 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipelines that will be frozen soon, the ice death threatens.
The scientists have been causing confusion for years in a mysterious phenomenon, the swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is the gravitational altimeter of space probes, during which they gain additional momentum in a celestial body, such as the Earth's gravitational field.
Thus, probes can save large quantities of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe, like the Ulysses solar probe, used this physical trick.
However, what has amazed researchers for many years: Flying objects do not behave fully as they would be expected under the ancient gravitational law.
Instead, there are abnormalities in speed.
The probes are suddenly accelerating or slowing down.
The physicists have so far found no explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was crucified as swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct, which considers the mass withdrawal of the material as a curve of space.
Stephen Adler, American physicist, associate of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, remains firmly convinced that Einstein was not wrong and is trying to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter discovered by astronauts in the universe.
"The dark matter may be responsible for the anomaly, which may even be found near Earth," writes Adler.
Space scientists learned about the existence of dark matter only ten years ago.
It manifests itself as a gravitational force whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, i.e. no electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light is emitted or released.
Scientists calculate that a good fifth of the total mass of the universe consists of dark matter.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt have been released
After ten days in prison for their kidnappers, the tourists who were taken to Egypt were once again free, confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
Sudanese kidnappers have claimed a ransom of millions of euros.
The hostages were reportedly killed by six hostages in the shooting before the hostages were released.
Five German citizens were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
Over and over Germans are targeting kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists in the Sahara are free.
In agreement, this was reported by the Egyptian state television, Al-Arabija Arabic TV and Italian media.
According to reports from the Italian Sky TG 24, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of release: "Our fellows and other hostages were released.
We're looking at their health right now," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian citizen and eight Egyptian escorts are safe and safe - reported by the Egyptian state television.
19 participants in the desert expedition are supposed to be on their way to Cairo.
The reason for the shooting before the release of the hostages remains vague: According to an Egyptian security officer, hostages have already shown a willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army surprisingly killed their six.
"The problem is solved.
The ransom was accepted," said the official.
"The trial was only about taking hostages," when it suddenly happened "the surprise."
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers on Sundays in the Sudan, Chad, and Egypt, and two were arrested.
The hostages demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money should have been handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "al-Maszri al-Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release of hostages is delayed because the kidnappers are concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, hostages release female hostages after the ransom is paid.
Men are being held by kidnappers until a safe escape route is found.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
"He led to suicide" the stepfather's violence
In court, it was said that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather had been raping her for years.
Michael Trerise, a 57-year-old living in Stithians, Cornwall County, spent six years in prison after confessing to an eight-order rape attempt.
The court of criminal law in Trouro has learned that he has regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle between the ages of five and seven.
In one of Trerise's statements, he wrote, "I feel responsible for his death."
At the trial, it was said that at 34 years of age, Randle committed suicide at the home of the city of Plymouth in Mutley, on 1 April 2007.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her eyes and tied her eyes before intercourse while her mother worked at a brewery.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and chose Cornwall as his residence again.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it turned out that Ms. Randle, who spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust Memorial Organization, was persecuted by the horrors of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, D.A. Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who used to be passionately fond of surfing and cycling, said that her friends were "sensitively dead" and "discontinued life".
In April 2007, his father Terrance Randle found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
She probably strangled herself with a bag.
Mr. Randle got in a fight with his daughter's stepfather, who ended his statement in a letter: "I always tied him up and tied his eyes.
I wasn't sexually harassing him.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and I'm sure this was terrible for his victim, especially if he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim killing himself.
Even more thoughtful, however, is the fact that if he didn't, the case might never have been brought to trial."
The judge added: "I would like to draw attention to the effect Stephanie's parents have had on your crime daughter over the years.
If this didn't happen, she would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman."
An official who has lost important data has been charged with:
According to the BBC's reports, they're charged with a breach of official secrecy with the government official who left strictly secret documents on a train in June.
He was on a mission from the Ministry of Defence when he left two strictly secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were transferred to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the slightest charge of a violation of the law, and there is no suspicion of a deliberate offence.
Frank Gardner, a reporter from the BBC Department of Defense, said the move surprised a lot of people at Whitehall.
"They thought the Ministry of Defence and the government would treat this case as an internal matter," he said.
The staff member, who cannot be named, has been prosecuted under Section 8.1 of the Act, and this paragraph concerns the preservation of information.
The Public Prosecutor's Office has recommended that the case against the official be represented by Metropolitan Police for his rather sensitive work on the United Commission for Intelligence.
The documents he lost included classified surveys on Al-Qaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
He was notified of the decision on Monday and moved from his home to an unknown location.
Housebuilding cooperatives pay B&amp;B account
UK housing cooperatives can count on an account of more than GBP 80 million after the rescue of Bradford &amp; Bingley Bank.
The government spent GBP 14 billion on protecting the deposits of Bradford &amp; Bingley.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use depositors' money, including 59 housing cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, President of the Association of Housebuilding Textiles (BSA), "annoys" that companies and members have to pay.
The 14 billion outstanding loans will ultimately be repaid after the repayment of Bradford &amp; Bingley’s mortgage.
However, the interest accumulated in the meantime is charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing cooperatives are one of them.
It is annoying that institutions that have been acting with caution so far must now pay the bills of institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that each company has to pay as much as the amount of the deposit it holds. The companies share 18% of the costs among themselves.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the amount of the loan will reach GBP 450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies will have to put aside GBP 81 million to pay interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Housebuilding Association, told the BBC that it considered the measure to be unfair.
"It is regrettable that those institutions must pay the accounts of much less cautious institutions that have acted with caution during the recovery of the housing market."
According to BSA, none of the companies have been destroyed since they started operating in 1945.
"We need to examine this case in all aspects in the next few weeks in order to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from a significant account," he added.
The interest due in 2009 shall cover 7 months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, a full-year interest rate will have to be paid, which could be twice as much as the current one.
As housing cooperatives are self-help organisations, without shareholders, eventually members will have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or through lower interest rates on their deposits.
The price of milk increases by fivepence per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy company announced that it would increase the wholesale price of milk by another fivep from Monday.
This is the second price increase since the twopence increases in February and after a survey by an advisory company.
The resellers decide whether to pass the price increase on to consumers.
Before the increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk changed last in 2002.
A request from a former Member of the Parliament of Bangladesh was rejected in order to be able to defend himself freely.
The Bangladeshi court rejected the request by the former Member of Parliament Sheikh Hasina to defend himself on the stand, which means that he can be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyer told me that the court refused to defend himself on the grounds that he had blackmailed a businessman during his parliamentary term (EUR 729,700).
This case is just one of the countless corruption charges brought against him.
Sheikh Hasina's old political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released for bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina must return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, demands that the country's army-supported temporary government give her full freedom first.
According to the reports, although it has been conditionally released for treatment abroad, it is not clear from the conditions under which it is placed on the free foot that it can retain its freedom when it returns to the country.
Your lawyers say you will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Appellate Tribunal.
"The Appellate Tribunal rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail as not necessary, since it was temporarily set free and attends treatment abroad," we learned from Rafique-ul Huq, a lawyer.
"We will appeal against the decision of the court of appeal."
According to his lawyers, he needs to be protected in the field in order to return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League on Sunday said that Sheikh Hasina was expected to return after October 17th.
Last year, he was taken into custody after the military - supported temporary government took over, but he was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Concerns about the vaccination programme against the polio in Afghanistan
According to the UN, almost 200 000 children from Afghanistan were left out of the recently organized polio vaccination programme for violence against the Taliban.
Last week, the UN organized a vaccination operation in six provinces.
However, they said that for security reasons they could not reach children living in parts of Helmand and Kandahar, South.
According to a UN spokesperson, this has happened despite the promise made by the Taliban: they will not attack or impede the work of thousands of people who have been vaccinated.
BSkyB’s appeal against ITV was rejected
They rejected BskyB’s appeal against the decision of the Competition Committee, which ordered it to reduce its interest in rival television tax, ITV.
The Competition Law Appeal Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its share of ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Committee has previously established that BSkyB’s stake is an obstacle to competition and that it puts the company under unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB acquired its stake in 2006 and thus effectively prevented NTL, which has since been renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the share of ITV purchased by BSkyB jeopardises ITV’s independence by encouraging the Competition Law Commission to initiate an investigation.
The Director of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom were all against buying-in.
The BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in ITV participation was a pointless and disproportionate compensation, especially given that BSkyB stated that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
A further investigation of the U.S. Attorneys' case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the death of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move followed that the report on the case prepared by the Chief Prosecutor of the Justice Wallet criticised the decisions of government officials.
The report criticised the White House officials, the legislators and the former chief prosecutor, Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was afraid that the state prosecutors would be lost for political reasons.
Nora Dannehy, Special Prosecutor, will now investigate whether the officials who were heard during the investigation have attempted to prevent justice by lying.
"Serious charges of a possible crime have not yet been investigated and have not been clarified," said Inspector Glenn Fine.
One of his main suggestions was to appoint a special prosecutor who has the authority to order witnesses to testify.
The series started by removing nine state prosecutors from the U.S. judicial wallet in December 2006.
At the time, they said the D.A.s were dismissed because of their poor performance.
However, it was later found that the state prosecutors who were saved received nothing worse than many of their colleagues, which led many to the conclusion that political consideration had been drawn behind the dismissals.
Some prosecutors participated in the criminal prosecution of high-ranking Republican members of Congress, while others refused to participate in the investigation of electoral fraud charges against Democrats.
The U.S. Attorneys are conducting an investigation under the authority of the government and conducting judicial proceedings.
It can be saved at any time, but for political reasons, it cannot be removed from their position.
At the time, the head of the judicial case, Alberto Gonzales, became the target of the state's attorney-in-chief attacks, and eventually resigned.
Many other officials in the judicial wallet have also given up their resignations.
In his report, Mr Gonzales highly criticised his role in the case. According to him, the chief state prosecutor is "priority" responsible for the dismissals, "discontinued" the governing role, and "disembarkedly" himself out of the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former assistant to the older Bush, are judged not to have cooperated during the investigation.
Meat Loaf Eposa gets recognition
The rock star Meat Loaf will receive recognition for the epiphany of the Q Awards award-winning album "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive his special gold medal next week at the London festival, said that he would be honored.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second song was the titled song of Meat Loaf's 1977 public success harvest album.
Coldplay received most of the nominations for this year's prizes, they were listed in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres and "Bat Out Of Hell" like that."
The song Jim Steinman made was very loud, and it was Meat Loafé.
The song started with an almost two-minute instrument section.
It appeared as a small album in 1979, and it reached its 15th place on the hit list.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" album has been on the hit list for almost nine years and has been sold over 40 million copies of it.
Meat Loaf - a true name of Marvin Lee Aday - has recently been struggling with health problems. Among other things, in 2003 he had had surgery due to his heart rhythm disorder after he collapsed on the stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel some concerts due to acute inflammation of the larynx.
Later, it turned out that there was cyst on his voice.
Unknown city street, often forgotten and perhaps soon sold
New York City has thousands of freeways, tours and other side roads, some of which are famous, others are merely performing practical functions.
However, many trained taxi drivers and long-term local residents would find it hard to tell where the Extra Place is, mostly because they've never heard of it.
The little street is in East Village, heading north from First Street, without reaching Second Street, between Bowery and Second Avenue.
Approximately 9 m wide and 36 m long, and much more similar to a dusty alley than a main transport route.
There are no street signs.
Technically, you can't find it on a standard map.
However, the street has admirers.
There it is, for example, the construction of the newly built First Street luxury buildings in Avalon Bay.
He wants to re-paint the Extra Place and make sure that new buildings can be delivered on a cleaner route to shops and boutiques.
The admirers of the street include the neighbors who lived here for a long time, who were caught in the skanka street, that this was the only remnant of the past before the renovations in the area.
However, it is not in the interest of the street owner, the city's building-holding and development department.
This month, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay, at a meeting of the district municipal district management committee, submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the Committee would prefer the street to remain in the city and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the 3rd municipal body.
"There are very few areas in the city already, and we want the Extra Place to remain in the city," he said.
"The proposals for the renovation and management of Avalon may be included, but we would also like to guarantee that it remains available to the public."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that he wanted to re-encourage the small street and provide seats, some of which would be used by a coffee shop that the builder would expect to rent out an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson of Avalon Bay, said that although the company would like to use the street, it does not insist on possession.
"The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to renovate this stunned alley and turn it into a pleasant public place," he said, adding that the city suggested buying it.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Building and Conservation Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and noted that the office was responsible for building development and not management.
Compared to Bowery's more colourful neighbor, Extra Place has little historical significance.
Some say he received the name "her land" in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's great estate was divided into many children, and no one claimed narrow ground.
A punk-rock monument closed in 2006, the back exit of CBGB opened to the Extra Place, and perhaps the most important part of the street was the photo on the cover of Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" album.
"It was a good scene," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was filled with garbage, clothes, barrels and posters, and leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how the middle class owned the East Village, oppose the sale of the Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, however modest, must remain in the community.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rare part of the city, which has remained virtually unchanged and must be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, writer of the blog entitled "Jeremiah's Fascinating New York" (book of Kings: bitter nostalgia about the process of the city's extinction), put on his blog part of the story of Extra Place, which appeared in the section "Városi holocaust" of the week of The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end, which is still dark during the day, surrounded by rusty, iron-made storage doors and splitt windows, and where the wind carries one week of newspapers in the canals."
Except for a few exceptions, the street looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran across the street, next to the back door, which used to lead to CBGB, and now belongs to a higher-priced clothing store.
The walls were graffiti, and an empty bottle of 0.75 liters of beer was lying next to a thrown-out, fresh paper pile.
Some walkers told me they rarely remember the Extra Place, but they think they could use the renovation.
Fields said that some people underestimate the attractiveness of the street in its present state.
"I spent the best years of my life in dark, greasy and disgusting places," he said.
Debate on multilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
In this section of the Education Monitor, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the opinion of the candidates on multilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why does the middle class need school choice", is an experienced researcher and head of education research at the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research.
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama's education proposals are also included.
Obama's campaign says "Students with African-American and Spanish lips are significantly less likely to get a degree than white students," and that's true.
In order to overcome such differences in performance, Obama's educational plan explicitly supports, inter alia, "temporary bilingual education" for English learners.
At the same time, for Obama, the question is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which places emphasis on school education in non-English languages, is out of touch with his interest in combating large differences in performance.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep contract school in the eastern part of Los Angeles County.
Most of the students in the school have Spanish lips and low incomes.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, learn English.
Nevertheless, 100% of the fourth graders achieved an excellent result in the 2008 state mathematics exam.
It is equally impressive that 93% of the fourth graders have completed an excellent English language and literature exam.
This incredible performance was not achieved by the device that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street focuses on repetition, practice, continuous assessment of skills and rejection of objections.
In addition, and this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels, the Director of Sixth Street, the school's educational principle is the "fully immersion" of students studying English into the linguistic environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of English in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said: "We have had a huge success in walking into a classroom, we wouldn't know who the student was who arrived 12 months before from Mexico. "
"It works," he said, "we work."
Would Obama set schools such as Sixth Street Prep as an example for other schools that teach a significant number of Spanish-speaking and English students?
The results achieved by the school should be made clear, but because of its own education policy (national educational associations have long supported bilingual education), and because they themselves consistently stand up for bilingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama's response.
Although agreeing that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently made a very small statement about the issue when he said that people should not be so concerned about the legislative process as to "only English.
Instead, he said, "They should get their children to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to make sure that the differences between the results are reduced, he should seriously study the models that work instead of looking down and ignoring them.
Oil prices fell sharply due to renewed economic concerns
On Monday, oil prices fell steeply because of concerns that the American rescue plan for financial markets would not be able to reinvigorate the economy.
The crude oil securities dropped by seven percent to $99.80 in the morning at the New York Trade Exchange.
Prices have decreased by over $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, the stock exchanges have been hit by the Wall Street financial disturbance and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached 145.29 per barrel in July, almost 90 dollars per barrel was returned at the beginning of this month before being again affected by the inestimable uncertainty of the financial markets.
On Monday, even after the heads of Congress announced that they were able to reach agreement on the economic rescue operation, which is the biggest in history.
The news has been shadowed by the concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for a long time.
As the latest event of the emerging crisis, the Citigroup will buy up the banking business of the Wachovia Corporation, announced by the government on Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partly nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital's analysts, as a result of desperate weekend negotiations, "the rescue operation seems to have failed to reinvigorate the trading mood on the stock market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that demand for goods, such as oil, will also fall.
"The future of the global stock market, interest rates and foreign exchange rate markets has become uncertain," wrote an analyst of Deutsche Bank for investors.
"We believe that the market for goods will not be avoided by the epidemic."
From the point of view of the stock exchange, the biggest question is the extent to which the "disease" of the United States is infecting the world, especially China.
As oil consumption decreased due to the slowdown in economic growth, the banks' analysts cut their expectations for next year, reducing their forecast for oil and gas prices by 20% in 2009.
With the second quarter's bravour, the team set their record
After spending more than eight seasons in the Jets field than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, playing defense end position, thought he'd seen everything.
But then he watched the opening of the second quarter on Sunday when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational game.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the games of Jets and Arizona Cardinals were fully aligned with the dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre, a quarterback, gave Laveranues Coles a 12-yard touchdown pass. This was a perfect pretext for an afternoon in which their emerging cooperation developed significantly.
Favre gave Coles two touchdown pass in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks fell after each other 10 seconds before the end of the half-life.
"I wasn't sorry for the trouble," Favre said about all his passports to Coles.
"Pokoli's a good player.
We've been able to communicate well with each other so far, regardless of what people think."
While Favre and Coles played ball, the defense stopped the Cardinals' controller, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, in the cornerback position, caught a bad shot and threw it back at him with 32 yards worth of touchdown.
Eric Smith, the safety player reached into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker got the ball out of Warner's hands.
This last turn could have been the most amazing move in the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end, and the Jets got it, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal, setting the result at 34:0.
That was the best result the Jets achieved within a quarter.
When the Jets coach, Eric Mangini, was asked to describe the mind-absorbing nature of the game, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When they told him that both of them - in the third quarter of the Cardinals scored 21 points that the Jets didn't get one - Mangini said: "I have to tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
We got a lot of points in a short time."
The rested Gebrselassie beats her own world record
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many consider it the best mid- and long-term runner ever, when he beat his world record in Berlin on Sunday, and he became the first one to run the 42.2 kilometers in 2 hours 4 minutes.
With the victory of 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds in his previous result of 2:04:26, which he achieved in Berlin last year.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie set a 26th world record in a wide range of areas where she won a world championship or a world record from 1500 m to the marathon in almost all time.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing that, in view of it, air pollution would further aggravate his asthmatic problems.
Instead, he called me for the Berlin marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - at daytime, initially at 9 °C and at the end of 13 °C - Gebrselassie won a Sunday at an incredible speed of 2 minutes at 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since the marathon has not started before, such as Gebrselassie, and the Kenyan Paul Tergat has turned towards longer distances, the marathon record has been reduced by more than two minutes in the past decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won 2:06:05 in Berlin in 1998.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago, her two legs were cramped and she couldn't train for two weeks.
Obviously, he was refreshed during his forced rest, and he wasn't rusty.
"I'm so glad," said Gebrselassie to the reporters.
"It all worked out perfectly.
I started training a week ago, and today I had doubts, but it was all right."
He received some criticisms, particularly from Kenya, the Eastern African rival of Ethiopia, that he uses too much aid in his competitions, usually avoiding many world-famous marathon runners, relying on his exorcisms as if he were on the track and putting world record in front of the competitive spirit.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie's greatness in the long run.
On Sunday Gebrselassie reached the midpoint under 1:02:04.
Two leading Kenya runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the runaways were exhausted.
Gebrselassie left Kwambai with one last sprint, which reached second goal by 2:05:36, 5 minutes repairing her individual best.
Kamathi arrived third under 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen, ended a remarkable year with the seventh fastest victory, 2:19:19.
The world peak is held by the British Paula Radcliffe with 2:15:25.
Last spring Mikitenko won the 36-year-old surprise at the London marathon with results 2:24:14.
Because of the alleged back injury to the Beijing Olympics, he was quickly cured and won the Berlin marathon, where he fixed five minutes on his individual tip. It was the third marathon long run he attended.
He won the tournament with a smart count: first he allowed a group of four of Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and gain significant leadership, and then after about 30 km he started after them.
The Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa reached its second goal by 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop in Kenya was third with 2:25:01 results.
A separate city, the pride and trials of black people
In the experience park in Greater Orlando, a few miles away from everything that shines, sounds and is huge, there is a quiet small town where the pride and complexities of African American life have been born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city to be integrated into the country, which was the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: "The five lakes, three croquets, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guavas and two schools without prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have already attended the annual Zora Festival. The eatonville ceremony is held in honor of the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance, Hurston.
However, in many respects, the city described by him and made it a tourist attraction, which is also included in the Florida Guide published by the Project of the Federal writers of the Age of Crisis.
It was as independent, dignified and closed up as it was in the 1930s when, according to a report by Hurston, Florida, urban blacks often refused to share their true thoughts with white people who "know so little about us that they don't know what they're missing."
Even in that year, when the black presidential candidate, Barack Obama, encouraged an open debate on the issue of race, many people here are distrustful of the looks of the outsiders.
"We are very careful to tell our story," reported 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lived here all his life and is a member of the oldest church in the city.
"You have to tell me exactly what you want."
Eatonville has long been characterised by a paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, the model of black stand-out is of historical importance, but it is a community of almost 2400 people where poverty indicators reach the double national average.
Partly a literary node, and part of it is an example of a culture formed as a result of American slavery, sometimes looked down, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black, which flourishes in the shadow of oak trees.
It is not surprising, then, that the people here are both proud and defensive.
The image of Eatonville has been important since Zora, and everyone calls it Hurston.
In the honest, strong dialects - such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Your Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) - she presented her hometown to the world.
Five paragraphs of the Florida Guide have transformed the city, which is next to Route 17. This road leads from the long forgotten center of Florida to one of the places of black history and human dramas.
Hurston, who was brave in both life and literature, as well as in drumming, introduced his readers into the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke's business, and then looked into the more confidential spheres.
He wrote: "We find modern public school to the right of the road, with a brown-based white area, carefully maintained courtyards and playgrounds, which Howard Miller takes care of, although he can barely write and read."
He mentioned the widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sales all kinds of drinks and anything that might be needed in temporary lodgings."
Thus, a few hundred words of Hurston connected Eatonville to autonomy, but also to illiteracy, remarried and sex.
It is clear that the Fodor's Guide presented it differently.
This description really didn't work out for everyone.
"Zora told me the way they were," reported the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, and Hurston made them immortal by quoting from the chump songs that men sang about their beauty.
He said, "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as the living special, who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
The 77-year-old, Augustus Franklin, recalled that when Hurston stormed into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a stunner Chevrolet smoking and in long pants in a city where people were still proud of their dignified clothing.
Most people were fascinated, Franklin said, but a lot of people were snooping.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Franklin.
However, on the terrace facing Lake Sabelia, where, most likely, Hurston was baptized, he used to swing in his chair, saying, "I never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were no longer published.
It seemed that, along with most of the world, Eatonville forgot about it.
Although he was once a popular writer, Langston Hughes' contemporary, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s was buried in an unmarked tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he lived before.
There were no significant commemorations or large public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood how much he enriched the world, or what he left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the book Hurston biography published in 2003 entitled "Switzerland".
The turning point came in 1980.
Officials of the county of Orange wanted to build a five-track road through the city instead of the two-track main road, the Kennedy Avenue, which had an important role in the community's life.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated the city's western border with Interstate 4 motorways connecting states.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still walking after a difficult historical period.
Among other things, forced integration has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battles related to racial confusion tasted hatred with the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys came over, and they threw drapes and other things on the side of the road," said Franklin.
"There was a lady who died in this.
They threw a Greek melon out of a car."
In a letter to The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston questioned the ruling of the Supreme Court on the violent integration of the "Brown v. Board of Education": "He is insulting and not respecting my species."
Today, residents say that the desegregation of schools was positive in some respects, weakened the unity of the Eatonville people and undermined the confidence of young people.
"The black children are used to being killed - I remember this - the man embraced his teacher in the morning and in the evening," reported N.Y. Natiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins, Managing Director of the Non-Profit Association "Keep the Community of Eatonville".
"It lasted until the students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean, there were cultural differences between us," said Natiri.
However, human rights have helped many other Zora Neale Hurston rise - in black writers, actors and artists who have risen above prejudices, just as he did, with such positive confidence and lines as this: "How can anyone deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!
That's incomprehensible to me."
In 1975 Alice Walker traveled to Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to restore her reputation.
Five years later, the bookshelf was placed on the shelves of the bookshelfs by Robert E. Hemenway, a well - known biography of Hurston, which was once again one of America’s role models.
The road construction project would have started just when the most famous daughter in Eatonville was again at the heart of attention.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors regarded him as a savior.
In 1988, the community started organising a Hurston festival to show what would ruin the county's main route.
Thousands of fans have arrived for the opening event two years later, and many have returned to the ceremony every January.
A few years later, the county stopped its road construction proposal.
"With the five-tracking of the main road, the community has been reinvigorated, linked to full speed, which means real civil pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd simply said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the image of the city itself.
The number of people living outside the city was increasing, such as Rachelle Munson, who began to attend church here in 1993, and the locals began to review the past.
Eatonville was entered on the national historical list in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-tier (naturally named Hurston) library was opened on the re-covered and beautiful Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville still has Florida's cuckoo egg: it's not exactly ten km from Orlando's center, but sometimes it feels like a suburban side street during the summer rain; it's as small as when 27 black families were founded in the 1880s.
(Today 90% of the inhabitants are black.)
They're still taking care of the outsiders who come here looking for the story of Eatonville.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things - such as the oldest fresco in Eatonville, painted by a white man and depicting black people working on the ground - should not be photographed.
In Eatonville, many - including the confident teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to the lively red - fear that their separate community will be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival became more and more widespread, the pride of the home town grew.
In particular, young people increasingly view Eatonville as they see their own species: they are wonderful, with problems and everything, neither better nor worse, as proud, creative, diligent, foolish and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
An honest civil bond lies in the words of Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18-year-old, who plans to return after graduation to the local government or to the police, which he thinks are in need of help.
And it seems that the younger ones have also learned to correctly describe Eatonville, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just travel through here think this town is nothing compared to the others," said Alondra Kenon recently after the service on a Sunday.
"But if someone stops and takes some time to get to know his history, it's a very nice city."
In New York, we all speak the language of finance.
Nothing on the surface has changed.
If the tourists didn't care about the newsrooms and the huge television projectors on Times Square, they wouldn't notice they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with glass-walled bee-shaped offices above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers, who have been in control of New York, have been living the hardest days since 1929.
The couriers are still rocking their metal tea cars on the sidewalks, transporting muffin-loaded trays to the morning meetings.
Men with Spanish lips are still bouncing between blocks, carrying as human mules 50 or more of the leftover shirts hanging on a verblike loop across their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their morning sweet bakeries at the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4:00 and 7:00 a.m.
I did not feel that there would be any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite every warning news, I decided to open a new bank account.
Although I was planning on doing this during the afternoon's rest period in my local account of JP Morgan Chase's bank, there were about 20 people in front of me.
Not at the banker's window, where money can be collected or paid, but at the customer service desk, where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask directions to Macy's, and where new customers open a bank account.
In front of me, I learned later from Starr, the "ordered" banker, they lined up with the same intention as me.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken their money out of smaller banks in their home, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They took money from so-called savings banks (such as housing cooperatives), credit cooperatives and small-town savings banks that operate only in a single state and allegedly treat their customers as family members.
Last year, 15 of these banks went down quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of $327 billion, was bankrupt, and when the New Yorkers went home Friday evening for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, was a banker with a savings of $440 billion.
The employees in front of me from the office and shop, afraid of another collapse, transferred their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe haven, to the bank that buys most of the capital injections on Wall Street.
The simple people of New York have become experts in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman at the local Chinese store on her phone was talking about Lehman Brothers Bank and his huge-looking CEO Dick Fuld complaining to a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the caretaker of my apartment block changed the subject of a uniformed 50-year-old caretaker, not Brad and Angelina, or my food shipment, as we used to.
He said to me after I went to the bank, "I invested all my money saved in money market instruments.
I've changed, I'm not risking."
Musulmian graves were disgraced while Austria was on the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, a right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a right-wing Belgian party, Vlaams Belang, participated in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, in which the organization "Warers Against the Reconciliation of Islam" was introduced.
They were accompanied by signs of traffic signs that portrayed mosques drawn by a red line.
According to the police, the extremists on the far right are responsible for the defamation of the Austrian Muslim cemeterys, which took place at the same weekend when the far right parties had made significant progress in the national parliamentary elections.
There's more than 90 graves in the trauni cemetery next to Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators used a painter to draw Jewish symbols, such as the star David, on some graves, but the detectives found that they were trying to hide their extreme motives from hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident can be linked in any way to the elections.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said that "they were deeply shocked" at the cry, which happened shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month, the end of Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is conducting a conscience-recognition study following yesterday's parliamentary elections, during which the language of the political balance is called to the right.
The two far-right parties, which gained almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for the future of the Freedom Party and the Alliance of Austria, for a highly anti-immigration law, and they labeled some of their slogans as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the Party of Freedom, which has acquired more than 18% of the votes, expressed a campaign against headgear and envelopes, as well as a rejection of food that is allegedly related to Islam.
At the final assembly of the party in Vienna, he spoke of "European brotherhood", which prevents the Islamic strengthening.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minorates by arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
According to public opinion polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections leading to the outright win, the change was largely due to the young electoral base, who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter has been banned from a foreign trip
Garry Glitter, a known rock star convicted of rape of children, was banned from travelling in France and Spain by the court.
The judges decided to ban Glitter for six months after notifying the authorities that he intended to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent Police Department acquired a travel ban on Thursday after submitting evidence to the Court of Justice regarding the convictions of sexual violence against children against Glitter.
Glitter, a true name of Paul Gadd, was not involved in the Ashford Magistrates trial in Kent, but represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokesperson said: "On Thursday, 25 September, the Kent police applied to the Ashford Magistrates Court for the prevention of Paul Gadd's planned travel to France and Spain.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter has informed the authorities of its intention to travel abroad because it is bound by the law on persons in the register of sex offenders.
It shall inform the authorities if it intends to travel abroad for more than three days.
He shall also notify the police at least seven days before the planned trip.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to five years' imprisonment.
The Kent Police told me they don't want to talk about individual cases in Glitter County and possible whereabouts.
We learned from the kent police spokesperson: "The kent police are doing everything in their power to protect children within the country and abroad.
"Our opinion is that it is easier to control someone without leaving the United Kingdom, because here we have a comprehensive system at our disposal so that we can manage potential risks more effectively.
"The main task of the Kent Police Department is to protect Kent's population. Through close cooperation, we continuously monitor the behaviour of persons in the sex offenders' records and in the county in order to minimise the potential risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10- and an 11 - year - old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he should have boarded a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The land authorities did not pass the passport test, so they eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow entry into the country, so they flew back to Bangkok, where local police and immigration officials insisted on returning to Britain.
Finally, on 22 August, he arrived at terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport and remained there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to the court in West London in Uxbridge, because, according to Scotland Yard's request, he was registered as a sex offender under a court order.
Glitter spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom in 1999 holding photographs of the rape of children.
According to a source from the Ministry of the Interior, Jacqui Smith, State Secretary for Home Affairs, has welcomed and welcomed the fact that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't take photographs on stage because I want to introduce the artist from a personal point of view"
There's no decoration, no tubs, no dancing shoes.
The great masters of flamenco from close to the body, without the excitement of the action: to get to know the ordinary face of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the normal person.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except for the intimate, distant moments, when we can catch a personal move, grab the depth of a captured look, or wonder at the beauty of the helpless, yet expressive hand of the artist who is preparing for this stage action.
In the German series Günther Bauer Flamenco-people, the theatre of singers, dancers and guitarists is combined with this less-known everyday page of the masters.
Through the photographs, flamenco presents its unique iconography from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of the month of Flamenco Photography, "reflects the growing international importance of flamenco from day to day" - believes the creator, adding that the flamenco-people could be "the character of anyone, since the images, when seen, the observer, is amazed that these images do not typical representations of artists.
These people on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and capture the audience.
On stage photography, however, is not suitable to capture their personality.
Their personality and character are the deepest of their beings.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to use the camera to inherit the personality of the flamenco's greats."
The Cante de las Minas festival was inspired by Bauer's long journey in 1997, during which portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers were made with a record camera.
These portraits quote classical photography thanks to the camera and theme selection.
However, the use of different stylistic instruments is disrupted by traditional image representation and suggests modernity. The following idea faithfully reflects Bauer's idea of flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, but it changes from day to day and is always impressive."
It's not dance, it's not singing or music in itself, it's the artist's personality, it's character, it's the audience.
In the days, the guiding principle of works that can be seen in the El Fotomata gallery is the search for an encounter with the essence, the artistic magic, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and display.
The names of the known forms of flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, mark this photo collection, which presents 60 artists.
The project has also become a flamenco anthology, from which an album containing the portraits presented at the exhibition will soon be published.
Bauer was inspired by his passion for portraits two years ago to repeat the idea with the "ports of Veteran athletes" series ("SportART project").
Although the concept of the flamenco-people is slightly different from this, the photographer adds: "I like to take pictures of people, get to know them and enter their lives for a longer or shorter time.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre in photography is the portrait.
You meet people, you meet people who you don't even know or who only want to take pictures for a few minutes.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.
The exhibition, selected from the portraits of the contemporary flamenco, is entitled Flamenco People, is located in El Fotomata Gallery under the number 20 parallel to Alameda de Hercules.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he works on is "ready"
The scene and the act are unknown, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also working on writing his new novel. The novel's main character is an Irish nationalist, Roger Casenan, who lived twenty years in Congo and went to Amazon.
The Literary Nobel Prize is also a possible writer at the Hay Festival Segovia event yesterday admitted that his current work is "ready" and "all signs indicate that you shouldn't write" the novel.
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it, and I hope I'm going to do it at some point" - he ended his talk with these words at the festival of thought, thought and opinion exchanges, which received hundreds of writers, historians and journalists for four days in the city of Aqueduct, as well as thousands of visitors.
The author of the "City and Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the celebration of literature, and he also replaced the hopes of it.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award voted by the participants, an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" novel.
The audience was welcomed by Felix Romeo. The audience soon received the watch, during which the Peruvian writer told with amazing memory talent and a large amount of humor how he developed his special adventure of reading passion and the writing profession of the desire to live; how he bridges the lack of inspiration with disciplined writing methods, hard documentation, many repairs and rewriting; how he influenced his writing profession Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what monuments his stories build on.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it was impossible to measure or show whether books would change our lives, but he added: "I don't think literature is just fun or tisar-life experience", as it influences people and forces them to think, so he asked the writers not to allow the temptation to be tempted and bear responsibility for their profession.
The steed weather makes the Posoblanco farewell shorter and the horse bull fights are too short.
The riding bull battle, which was traditionally held as the final occasion of the Pozoblanco Festivals, was cancelled yesterday morning after the upcoming horseback torrents found the arena unfit for the battle.
As a result, the Committee, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to miss the bullfight.
The weather tensions have torn the ceremony series thoroughly, since two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the second bullfight was missed because of the rain.
The future majors, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista Castilblanco, would have fought bulls.
So they only had a bullfight on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, and he took three ears home as a trophy, and he was put on his shoulders after the sophisticated and aesthetic struggle.
On the same afternoon, the two bulls of Alejandro Talavante gave him a number of awards and trophies, but this was more due to the audience than to its own performance.
After that, however, El Juli, who made little contribution to aging the reputation of the arena Los Llanos.
After a comfortable ride with the second bull, a large part of the audience was brought out of the current.
A van carrying two tons of hash was trying to escape the road check.
Four o'clock in the morning, 50 minutes.
The Basque Regional Police are conducting traffic checks in Armiño, Ulava.
The authorities will stop a van with two passengers trying to escape the action.
The shipment, more than two tons of hash, was not noticeable at the same time.
The detectives pursued the passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested, and identified as A.A.J., was reported by the Basque Government Homeland Department.
The captured man is accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting.
The case took place in the administrative territory of Armiño, where the employees of the State Traffic Control carried out traffic checks on the N-1 motorway.
When they tried to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas, and then left the inspection site.
The detectives chased him, then the vehicle stopped a few miles away from the landing lane, and its passengers fled the freeway towards a forested area.
The Basque Regional Police finally captured one of them, and after checking out the Iveco Daily branded van, they seized its shipment of 2,178 kilos of hash.
The hashballs that filled the back of the vehicle were transported by the police authorities to conduct a more thorough investigation and to measure the drug.
In addition, the verification showed that the false registration plate of the vehicle does not match the information contained in the van’s documents and therefore proceedings are also initiated against the arrested person for counterfeiting of the public document.
The Basque Regional Police continue to investigate the arrest of the other suspect, who, as has already been mentioned, has fled the motorway, and the definition of the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old defendant, A.A.J., was transferred to the police to conduct the necessary interrogations, and the court proceedings began within a few hours.
They arrested actress Heather Locklear for driving under the influence of the drug.
actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested by the police in Santa Barbara (California) this weekend because she was driving under the influence of the drug.
According to a witness, he tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange maneuvers, a spokesperson of the People magazine’s traffic surveillance in California.
According to the witness, around 16 o'clock, Locklear "pressed the gas to the floor, scorched the engine, tried to leave the parking lot in the forward and rearwards, and went through his sunglasses several times in the reverse."
Shortly after the witness, who probably didn't recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear stop on a highway nearby and get out of the car.
He also called the police because he was worried about Locklear's life.
When the police arrived, the actress sat in her car, which partially paralyzed the highway traffic.
"He seemed upset," so the patrols took him to a specialised center for a drug and alcohol test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and the alcohol consumption was almost immediately excluded, and the spokesperson also said that, based on the first impression of the officers, it was thought that Locklear was under the influence of a drug.
Lockleart was arrested and accused of driving under the influence of an unidentified drug. He was sent to a local prison about 19 hours later where he was released.
Locklear came out of a sanatorium in Arizona two months ago, where he was treated for his anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the Andalus Federation of the United Left to take action in the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, Secretary General of the IU and the United Left, said today that the regional Federation of the Society will decide on the case of the former Youth and Sports Council of the Seville City Council, Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned last week after he was accused of being abused of his position as a member of the family.
"I am a far-reaching federalist in these matters, and this case is indeed a matter for the Andalusian organization," Llamazares pointed out the procedure that the party must take against the former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that, in detecting any irregularities committed by Silva, "transparency" should be taken into account: "At IU has always been levelled in order to ensure maximum transparency in such cases."
He added that part of the training is "a strict code of ethics for civil servants."
"Mayan Blood", Garci's Epistle
The work by Benito Pérez Galdós Galdós, inspired José Luis Garci, who is acclaiming the Spanish's famous anti-French revolution in May blood, which, with a budget of almost EUR 15 million, is the largest work of his film photography.
Accordingly, the director tried to illustrate the human stream and social analysis he has always admired in his work. Today, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, Garci told the audience of the actors.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour Mayan blood is presented in the cinema on Friday, and will later be presented as a mini-series by Telemadrid in a range of more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, the great admirer of Galdos' literature, has made his childhood dream come true with this film. It is thanks to Esperanza Aguirre that he entrusted three years ago from Madrid Province to create a monument for the 200th anniversary of the Madrid events of May 2. Garci accepted the request on condition that the story was based on the National Epizodes.
The budget of 15 million was financed entirely by the Autonomous Province of Madrid, and Garci was a special opportunity: he was able to present "the confused Spaniards who were wrongly in favour of the wrong leader, because the fight for independence rejected the country with the rule of Ferdinand VII", he said.
The director, however, regretted the fact that he could not count the budget of Alatriste or Goya's phantoms, which kicked more than double the Mayan blood. Therefore, he was forced to skip a few scenes in the script, which are recorded together with Horacio Valcárcelle, as in many other times.
So he resorted to the usual working method of the director of the fresh start, and he took the scenes with the actors he started with before the film. Casting was not because Garci thought it was "a signifying", and because, as he said, "the directorate is part of the theatre and going to the cinema to find out what's going on in the industry we're working on."
Several actors in May blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not come before his camera for the first time.
Garci, who is proud of four Oscars and an Oscar prize, believes that this year's candidates from the Hollywood Academy represent Spain, namely the May blood, the Seven French billiards and none of the finally selected blind sunflowers represent the young generation of the Spanish cinema where it should be presented.
Garci with this movie doesn't count on prizes.
"In the beginning, you think you're working for the postage, and then you realize that only happiness matters, and you're happy to see another movie done," says Garci with a 30-year-old career behind his back.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer in Seville commemorates a dancer in Seville.
From the Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), Carmen Tórtola Valencia was born in Triana district and moved to London with her parents at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in eastern dances.
During his busy life, he fought for equality as a pioneer, whether Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against wearing a corset that inhibited the freedom of women's movement.
He launched a dance and aesthetic revolution in war Europe, and his life fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, "he recommended to me "Tortola, whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said: "Our goal is not to tell the story of his life, but to capture his spirit.
I've been thinking about the titles of his dances, flamenco styles.
For example, from the "pilango dance" to the guaji or the "snake dance" to the tango.
"He danced with sense, and others say that my style is the same," he says.
The light of the performance is highlighted by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda now sings again after the Open Door at Isabel's performance, and Matilde Coral, who, in this case, exceptionally wanted to work with a former student.
"Matilde will shape the older Tortola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you said yes to the request. It's a great honor to play in my play."
In addition, Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga musical directors and guitarists, Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón singers; El Pajaro batter, Rafa El Viola bang, and Juanfra Juárez actor, who "plays the true diva with his love and love."
The play also presents the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and it will reach distant areas, including India, the United States or Italy.
"I wanted to remember him because his personality had a great impact on his own age, but he is no longer known and even less appreciated for his work today," he says in Bayo.
The show starts at 8:00 p.m. tonight at the Lope de Vega theater.
By the end of the Triennium, there will be "The Log of a recently married poet"
The first illustrated edition of the diary of a newly married poet will be presented at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where in May 1916 Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia. The exhibition is part of the series of programmes titled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008), organized by the Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Literary Prize and the anniversary of the death of both of them.
Thus, Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium's final edition of this work, the International Congress in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize winner's memorial house and the travel exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: It's a bright summer tree". This year, the exhibition opened several Andalusian provinces and is scheduled to visit New York for the time of the International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the diary of a newly married poet, published by Perdo Tabernero, and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America is not that attractive.
"God sometimes produces perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that."
The quote comes from actress Sally Field, who worked in a film called The Victims of Sensation with Newman, and reflects the shock and inactivity caused by Newman's death in American cinema and throughout America.
How hard he got the Oscar.
retreated in 2007,
and he was well-knownly ill,
But still everyone was shocked by his death.
"Sometimes it is impossible to put our feelings into words, and I have now lost a good friend," said Robert Redford, "his existence made my life and this country better."
No one was afraid of becoming ridiculous or overdoing.
The hero of cinema and home went away in a particularly dark period, which was shadowed by the desperate search for terror and market conditions, American self-esteem and dignity.
When such difficult times go by and many easily lose their virtues and there are very few people we can look up to, it doesn't have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of the people, it was a reality of the platonic beauty and justice.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and a defender of lost and won cases, from the anti-drug foundation established in memory of the son of a first-born son who died in drug overdose to the creation of a home-like biofood brand.
It was a real gift to a country that had difficulty crossing its suicide feeding culture.
The sweeping wave of wonder has gone all over Hollywood, regardless of nationality and origin.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, said he died not a man but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, stated that his work with Newman was clearly the highlight of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad guy from Australia, called Newman the biggest inspiration.
George Clooney, who may be one of the few who are trying to follow Paul Newman's way of life today, said they require honesty and serious and distant privacy.
It's not always easy, if it's even possible in the middle of the media jungle today.
There's still someone who's trying, and Paul Newman's a role model.
She was divorced once, but after 50 years of faithful marriage to Joanne Woodward, she would have had many opportunities for infidelity.
"Why am I eating burgers somewhere else when the roasted meat is at home?"
In heaven, you can be proud that your daughters on earth are also fans, which is not very common in America.
"Of all his performances, he was not as proud of the role of faithful husband, loving father, caring grandfather and devoted human friend," he says.
The Madrid Olympics are on their way.
Indeed, many of us have a dream of being an Olympic in Madrid, and after 2012 has failed, it may become 2016.
But, I'm asking, are we really ready for him?
Because if we're starting from the race last night, I don't think so.
They called it the perfect race, but in my view, it was the worst of all the things I've ever been.
It was a block of nonsense, and if it were to be evaluated, and I would be the examiner, the result would clearly be a failure.
But let's move forward and start at the beginning.
The nonsense started with the reception of the serial number, which was why they had to arrive earlier.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go sooner, at least get everything at the same time (including the chip, avoid any later position).
That's not what happened.
First, only the serial number was given (first senselessness, therefore to go there sooner) and (after the usual line of work), how surprising was only the S T-shirt (second senselessness, because I had XL in my size).
What world do we live in?
Or is it because of the crisis that they decided to save money on the material and only buy cheaper, small T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still being dwarfed compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to going there early to take over the chip, the queue lasted 15 minutes from the arrival, and even the backpack had to be handed over.
The wait lasted longer than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race of more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't given up the backpack yet, and when we did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain has made it even more pleasant to wait more than 40 minutes, which has been covered by attempts to rise and stand-raise.
I think that by tomorrow we're going to have about 500 cases of pneumonia, and some of us, including myself, will not be able to get our position in real time.
If I were asked about the perfect race, I wouldn't have thought of that, of course.
So I think we can continue to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Looking for Microsoft (virtual) reception
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, with some kind of - not-intelligent - artificial intelligence capable of carrying out some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a vehicle in the company's territory) on the basis of information from the conversation.
This "receptive" is a camera and a facial and facial recognition system capable of detecting the number of people in the room who are - and it also notes what kind of clothing they wear - and hears and understands the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, it can group the people present on the basis of the discussions.
In the presentation video, the reception lady identifies a third person, but she knows that she is not part of the company that talks with her and she is not an employee of the company.
Ask him if he came to see someone and made sure he was in a hurry to help him.
All without the blue screen.
It's impressive.
But this is, of course, the music of the future.
Currently, the company has more important tasks, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
A lot of people this week have been tearing up that Microsoft has become a strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contain fewer ancillary programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were running the programs that were needed instead of all the commercial garbage, the machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's something.
The Spanish wax has been invented, given that Microsoft has added extra features and extras to Windows in all new versions so far.
The change of direction will be reversed.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly in need, and the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared online, I joined the theory that Google took the first step to become a competitor of Windows.
Many rightly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary, as it is essential for hardware and software dialogue.
It plays the same role as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It's never going to disappear, but you have to count the "death" of the operating system, not absolute, but relatively.
Ballmer's statement this week supports this thought.
People are paying less attention to the operating system and more to the web browser.
We only turn on the computer to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and more and more time to browse than we spend in the world of windows.
What, then, is the majority of the applications associated with the system?
Less is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 is less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less burdened, less complicated.
Microsoft's goal is to integrate its services on-line and eventually become an alternative to Google.
All of this is very much needed, and I'll give you an example of why.
This photo was taken at the beginning of the month in a chat room designed for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the soda machine, they call a poster, they use the company's browser.
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the Internet.
By the way, last week a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, rather in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
After all, the cell phone is increasingly functioning as a computer.
But the slip, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely make their business worse.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
This was worn by Pablo Picasso in the diamond of Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick Blood, and Al Pacino in the godfather of Francis Ford Coppola, as well as one of the basic clothings of the trained gay public.
And while we're on the list of specialities, we can even recall the peace figure of the cuckoo-circumstant weight-lifter of the migratory circus.
But what are we talking about?
I mean, "tank", as the English lips call it, but none of his competitors with Le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles can compete.
First of all, because of his elegant name, although it is only referred to as "Marcel" among friends, which is due to sport, the legend is that Marcel Cerdan was named after the boxer, singer of Edith Piaf.
Marcel's excellent cotton material, unisex emblem, unique emblem and a small Belgian flag also emerge from its competitors. The latter is carried by the most typical models hidden in the neck of the T-shirt.
But the Belgian company doesn't just make tank tops.
The sports tops, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, wool pants, seamen's shirts, baby clothes, minisorts - and even so - are all products of the company.
And they're all in the comfortable underwear category,
Although it is also regrettable that they should be worn as underwear.
They're too good for that.
"I'd like to be a young mother; no matter who the father is."
He is very similar to his brother, but he managed to accomplish himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but it's full of energy.
At present, the Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modelling means much more than a few pretty and beautiful girls giving her name to something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango's new Paris office and at the transfer of the most prestigious fashion prizes sponsored by the Spanish company.
It's a source of warm and gentleness.
What are you doing in Paris, actually?
We will present Mango's new autumn-winter collection, which my brother and I planned with Penélopa. In addition, we will participate in the opening of the second 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the gala dinner in honor of Valentino at the Opera.
It's a busy day, that's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango.
We both love the movies of the '50s and '60s; we took over a lot of things from there.
And then, sometimes I just walk into town and watch women dress up, how they change their clothes, how they pick up their clothes - it's one of my favorite times.
You work as a dancer, an actress and a fashion designer.
That's what I think, but in the end, these three things are connected, because there's a lot of common points in them.
Even when I was a kid, I couldn't wait to go to my grandmother's and look in my aunt's lockers.
Well, that was you on the Canaan, almost worth a jolly park.
And then as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to my dress.
You know, we dancers like to figure out our own style for classes and rehearsals to make us feel good when we look in the mirror.
And in acting as an actress, you'll really be able to identify with your role when you get the costume.
See, it's all about everything, and all my respect for the designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no.
I feel better than ever, I love the '30s.
I think it's time for women to get there, they've had enough experience and less mistakes in life.
And the biological clock doesn't worry me.
Since I was a kid, I've been doing what I want to do, and it makes me happy inside.
And you want to be a mom or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because I was born as a woman, and I want to be a young mom, and I certainly don't want to miss that.
And as for the future father, no matter who he is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's just say a few words about the movie, and last year, you filmed a lot of movies they didn't even show.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started at the theater, am very impatient and restless, want everything right away, but of course I know that's impossible.
I look forward to presenting the last hour and searching for the grave of Christ.
I wonder what you think of them.
I understand you debuted on the runway a few days ago with Naomi Campbell.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go up to the runway as a model.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London, arranged for her own organisation, Women's for a better world. I've chosen two of her own Mango collections.
People don't even know how good-hearted Naomi is.
There are so many things about him, so I know him, and I can assure you that half of it isn't true.
On the other hand, I'm always looking at the good side of his activity.
He asked me for a noble cause for the fashion show, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I'll do it.
If women in the third world are at stake, I don't know the impossible.
Rebound drunk drivers will be obliged to install "Alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior would require the driver to install a device to prevent the start of the vehicle if the driver is in a drunk state or does not inflate.
The proposal was presented in June and is already being addressed by the State Prosecutor's Office, according to which the pilot project will last for one year.
As the project aims to restore the market, the driver will also have to attend a re-training course on road education.
In addition to the Transport Safety Attorney General, DGT and FITSA are involved in the experiment.
According to the statistics, 30-75% of the people arrested for driving drunk get back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, as the system connected to the vehicle determines the level of alcohol in the air. If it is greater than allowed, or if the driver has not inflated the device at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of the over 1000 euro instrument would be borne by the offender.
A 2007 US study showed that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could be saved every year.
The measure focuses on non-compliances for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent them becoming criminal:
On the other hand, it is easier to introduce it as the implementation of the legal reform is in the usual medium, while the necessary criminal reform would require a change to the basic law.
The instrument is not available on the Spanish market in any commercial way, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
Tomorrow, the House will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which, on a French model, calls for the system to be installed in school buses.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
In English, at the time announced in the program, at 17 o'clock at 40 minutes, the flight of the Spanish Air Force to the Prince Party of Asturias landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was on the way down, but it was still so hot that we could only see the royal party out of the plane using our hands as a blind eye.
At the foot of the stairs were the Spanish ambassador and other prominent personalities.
A few hours before, I asked a cab driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Prince's Couple was coming to the city for an official visit.
Okay, well, there's not going to be an airport transfer for a long time, so she's from around here or something.
No, no, sir, the lady is Spanish. She's just been here for a few years.
- Yeah, or...
But the Mexican press knows everything about the Prince's Couple of Asturias and the importance of their visit.
Many are waiting for the red carpets of the airport hangar, the choron of 27 sailors who provide protection of dignity.
The Prince appears, smiling, dressed in blue sea, and then the Princess gets wind into her long hair, dressed tightly, but not in the usual toe-flashing shoes - they may have warned that the city of Mexico is being threatened by storm.
For a moment, they stop and smile at the cameras, then they enter the room where the official bet follows.
At the gate of their hotel, which is one of the four biggest hotels in the city, they are awaiting a reporter on Mexican television.
The most valuable fashion fee
To deliver a fashion prize, the most suitable place in the world is undoubtedly Paris, and among the fashion designers living today, the most sophisticated and cool undoubtedly Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, the aim of which is to internationalise young talent in fashion.
The main prize is EUR 300,000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first competition, saw her own-designed clothes in the window of Mango, which was under 54 in Paris.
By the way, this is the second largest European business in Europe and has recently been opened in 1335 square meters.
The largest store is located in London.
In the middle of the big events and the thanks for Valentino's chairing of the jury, we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the most enjoyable Chagalok company, the president’s table made by Mango of the gala dinner was even more spectacular.
Nati, who came with a heavy heart and sorrow because of his recent death, carried a piece of the Company and some of the breathtaking jewels of the ELAH. He accompanied Valentin with his son, Luis, who was nearly two metres tall, to the main table of his honorable dinner.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, amused the guests. In addition to Baron Rotchil, they were so chivalry that they ended up not wearing a suit because they were both gifted to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in her own designed pants and shirts, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. At night's opera visit, she was so excited with Gaya Toledo's company in the ballet room that, recalling the old days, she slipped into one of the bars and framed a grand plie.
Inés Sastre didn't attend the palace visit, but before he showed me some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning, we were able to enjoy Oliver Martinez - he will be two metres tall and will be motoring - and John Travolta has arrived with the Intercontinental in Paris. He brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he said well in advance that he does not want any perfume in the room.
Stars under the stars of Paris.
Oh là, c'est la vie.
1001, stress relief number
There's not 1,000, there's 1,000, and there's one way to turn it off from the chaotic and messy everydays.
And the good news is that we can find them all in a single book that arrives at the bookstore on September 30 to bring peace.
It's almost painful to watch at 7:00 a.m., but it's even worse to think about how fast the world is making you live every day.
The office's name is tension, and the computer's got back pain.
Stress is the people's disease of the 21st century.
But there are not one way to overcome day-to-day fatigue and overcome problems at work.
No, this number is exactly 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massages or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in its book so that everyone can find a solution that is most comfortable and adapted to their free minutes.
The stress-solving work has the title 1001 relaxation method and the calm from it comes to booksellers from Pearson Alhambra y DK.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will certainly shake you in your faith.
In addition, it also offers other ideas that help all of us to relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% of natural food.
If you are too low to refresh the level of adrenaline and become the central problem of stress, it is time to sit back in the chair, relax and focus on reading only.
Who speak in their dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I'm not thinking about people who get excited and completely alert about what happened to them that day. I'm thinking about people who talk when they're asleep.
The phenomenon may seem frightening at first, but it's actually completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquism.
Very common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure they've been told he's spoken at night.
It may be completely rasodilated (for example, only once for a high fever) or more regular (every day, weekly or monthly) and usually the next day the child does not remember anything.
The appearance cannot be attributed to a single trigger.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night alarms, night urination (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but this is not legal.
As has been mentioned, the condition with high fever, or even the stress situation, or the exhilarating state, may be accompanied by an increased excitement.
Anyway, they didn't study it until now.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It may be silent, calm, and may consist of incoherent words, grinning, but, unlike all these things, it may also appear in the form of screaming, crying, or long speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and turn to the expert. The examination may reveal whether there is a problem causing great anxiety in the background and therefore a solution.
As mentioned earlier, it is a benign phenomenon, therefore, there is no cure unless associated with another form of sleep disorder (e.g. insomnia or stress).
But there are a few things we can do, here is a bouquet of preventive measures:
Keep your child calm before you go to bed.
Choose relaxing games and avoid the child watching scary or aggressive TV shows or series.
For children who are prone to nervousness or are more difficult to relax, we teach you some relaxation methods to find inner peace.
This will help the child to sleep more calmly.
If he starts talking while he's asleep, let's try to keep our peace.
Remember, it's harmless for the child, and the next day they won't remember anything.
Useful advice
Do not wake the child.
It wouldn't be necessary because the child isn't conscious, but he'd fall out of sleep.
Even though you're talking, you're actually sleeping and resting.
Remember, if the phenomenon is accompanied by multiple intense anxiety, it is advisable to turn to a professional or explore what causes the child to have a high degree of anxiety.
If you speak plainly (a rare case), do not start asking questions to find out anything from him.
It wouldn't be necessary anyway, 'cause when you sleep, you're not so conscious as to collect your thoughts.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech, but you can't see the dreams associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of what you've heard and any conclusions.
Don't ever tell the kid they can question him about his secrets at night.
Not even for a joke.
It's causing a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is that you don't worry, because it's just a few minutes of harmless episodes.
Finally straight to Illhaeusern
After a long deep-flying, the Illhaeusern team finally took a new boost and won again on their home course.
Although there was no fermented game, the yellow-blacks were in a position several times, one of which they could finally win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers had difficulty feeling the right rhythm.
The first gate was shot by the guest team captain Kauffmann, but the remote ball just touched the top corner of the gate tree. After that, Illhaeusern became superior and followed by the shootings: Fanderflick tried with a remote shot, and then Hirn's shooting went over the gate.
On the other side, the players fought in a block on the midfield, and only the ever-moving Riahi got shot.
The beginning of the second half was crucial: first Riahi and Temporale were placed on Dannemarie's side. Immediately after his first shot, the first goal was born: After Diebold's first shot, he won the ball with the excellent location of the Ilhaeuserni Marais and then put it in the gate (53 minutes).
However, Illhausern's goalmaker could not have enjoyed the glory for long: twelve minutes later, he was forced to leave the course, so his teammates had to continue fighting in a human background.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, could not take advantage of it: they did not cause much trouble for the domestic team, who were just a little more drawn back to strengthen their defenses. Only the last few seconds were holding some excitement when the ball came very close to the gate tree after a great hurry.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy puts a detour in Brittany.
The demonstration by fishermen on Monday has paralysed the traffic of several breton and Norman ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet the representatives of the protestors.
The latter promised to welcome the president in a "constructive spirit" and to express their hope that Sarkozy would "come with specific proposals".
The Presidential visit coincides with the crisis committee, which was set up by breton fishermen to take action against the rise in the price of gas oil, as the oil price exceeded the average price of a record of EUR 1.14 per litre.
David Martinon, spokesperson of the President of the Republic, said that "the President will discuss with fishermen what solutions could help companies to regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers".
Fishermen are determined to expect Nicolas Sarkozy to arrive.
On Tuesday morning, traffic demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados provinces, causing congestions of nearly ten miles [10 km] long.
They also paralyzed the transport of Quiberon's yacht port, but the road to Belle-île has not been closed.
On the Quiberon Peninsula, roadblocks were placed.
On Monday the sailors had already witnessed their determination. In the morning, tyres and pallets were set on fire in front of the fuel warehouses in the ports of Brest, while demonstrations took place in Concerteau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other ports of the Atlantic and La Manche. In Sables d'Olonne, Vendée County, for example, the fishermen did not board the ship, while in Le Havre some 20 vessels blocked the traffic of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic in Loire-Atlantique County eliminated the huge total oil refining block in Dongs.
However, the fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting to be held at the Ministry on Wednesday with a decision on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the "responsibility committee" should decide on its next step and participation in the meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris on Tuesday.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Committee, as the Committee has not supported their efforts.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not allow their demands" and "will not travel to Paris", for example, announced Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Fisheries Committee in Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on gas oil, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but believe that the operation of a vessel would only be profitable if the price of gas oil fell below EUR 0.30 per litre.
The wonderful Paul Newman
The unforgettable star of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid in Connecticut's home was 83 years old due to death, cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also paid their respects to the film legend and profession of Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer will not change its delivery plans for 2008.
Despite the global economic crisis, the Brazilian airline company plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, is able to keep plans, and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008 - confirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, president of the company.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturing company is heavily counting on the Chinese market, in particular for aircraft with 30-120 seats.
Embraer has delivered a total of 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, which has been set up by the US financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets so that it can repay the $85 billion that has been advanced to it - has announced the dominating issue of the Financial Times.
In addition to the international life insurance and US pension insurance activities, AIG would separate almost all other sectors of the business, the newspaper clarified the sources close to the case.
According to the Times, AIG’s board of directors met on Sunday night to examine the possibilities of selling.
AIG did not confirm this information.
The assets that AIG intends to sell include the airline leasing company International Lease Financial Corp, the 59% stake in the reinsurance company Transatlantic Holdings, as well as the real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Times adds.
However, according to the newspaper, there is no final decision on sales.
The AIG needs to have access to liquid assets quickly to repay the $85 billion loan approved by the US Government, thereby taking the risk that it will have to become 80% of its capital and lose its shareholders in a corresponding proportion.
Paris Historique study on Morning Meeting's Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic decline on Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson's rescue plan. Dow Jones' index fell by 6.98% (which has never seen a nearly 800 exact decrease) and Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) sank by 777,68 points, thus closing at 10 365,45 points.
The biggest decrease in the index so far (684.81 points) was registered on 17 September 2001 when trade resumed after the terrorist attack on 11 September.
Nasdaq, based mainly on technology papers, closed at 1.983.73 points with a fall of 199.61 points, while Standard &amp; Poor's 500 expanded index decreased by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106.55 points according to official closure data.
The Wall Street Stock Exchange was weakened even when it opened, and when the Senate suddenly rejected the bank rescue plan to restore market balance, it started to go deep.
The Members, with 228 'no' votes against 205 'yes', refused to provide the funds requested by the Minister of Finance Henry Paulson.
The plan was made by nearly two-thirds of the Republicans.
"From this, the market has filtered bad signals, as Congress seems unable to approve a plan," says Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial Analyst.
He added, and then expressed his concern that if such a plan were adopted a few days later, it would be "too late".
"If the plan is really doomed to death (...), then the Fed (American Central Bank - the Serk.) and the other central banks will have the turn to deal with the crisis, and the lending conditions will continue to tighten up" - warns Brian Bethune, the leading economist of the Global Discovery.
To further increase the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: "new and new financial institutions are going bankrupt every day" in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities made sure that Wachovia's banking business was purchased by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, which required emergency measures to save banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux states, Iceland and Germany, which indicates that the market is 'not only experiencing an American crisis but also a global crisis', the FTN Financial Analyzer adds.
The bond market has increased significantly.
The yield on a 10-year government bond decreased from 3.827% to 3.632% on Friday night, and the yield on the 30-year-old fell from 4.357% to 4.161% on the previous day.
Obama won the first television duel
The two American presidential candidates followed their first debate on Friday, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would be out of the duel as a winner.
Not surprisingly, the leaders of the Republican and Democrat campaign both made the victory in the television duel that was followed by a third of American households.
According to political analyst David Gergen, although John McCain's performance was respectable, it did not prove to be "satisfactory" enough to stop the fall in his popularity: this is evidenced by five weeks' polls before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democrat candidate is better in the fight: according to the results of the polls published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49%).
According to the 39% of respondents, who are most significant, are still determined to win Obama, while 25% of them are expected to win McCain, according to a survey by CBS.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his partymate Joseph Biden's promising Thursday performance. Biden is preparing for his first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned me this weekend: "It would be wrong to underestimate Palin.
He's got good instincts."
McCain, in his 70s, has never given priority to his own indisputably huge foreign policy experience. However, he stresses his opponent's "navigability" on these issues, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
"Senior Obama doesn't seem to understand," said the attack several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge of the presidential position," said McCain.
This is the main attack site that has been exploited by the Republican TV ads that have been running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that he represented the future.
He wouldn't let you be embarrassed. He'd put it together, and he'd put it straight.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama already does," he cut back the democratic ad broadcast this weekend, which puts the Republican leader's eye on the fact that he still hasn't assessed the impact of the crisis on the American street people.
"In ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama yesterday in front of 20 thousand people who gathered for the election meeting in the rains in North Carolina.
He did not even put the words "middle class" or "workers" out of his mouth. The troubled situation in the financial world undoubtedly favours Obama, whom the Americans consider most appropriate to save the economy on the brink of collapse.
"The next seven turns out to be points," said Charles Schumer yesterday, the powerful Democratic Senator.
Rahm Emanuel, a Democrat of the Clinton government, said that Obama has "as good an incentive in the economic field" as Bill Clinton did during the financial crisis in 1998.
In the eyes of the Democrat presidential candidate, the current crisis is "the final judgment on the bad economic policy for eight years, created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain".
Senator Illinois reaffirmed that despite stock exchanges, it will be able to reduce the tax burden on 95% of Americans, adding that its primary objectives include the creation of a country's potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources and the development of a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, plans to set up 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates were careful to avoid the issue of the bank rescue plan of $700 billion (EUR 470 billion): a highly unpopular plan was adopted by the Congress last night.
Minsk: "Did you notice that there was an election?"
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday night at the main hall of the Belarusian capital to reject the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, after the closing of the polls, hundreds of Belarusians gathered together in Minsk's main square to protest against the counterfeiting of election results.
Although the results have not yet been published, many young protestants against President Alexandr Lukashenko with the following words: "Mr. Dictator, resign!".
Some people admit that they didn't even go to the vote, "Why would I have gone? They do what they want with my vote?" says a young man.
The protesters do not believe that the regime, which sought to be well represented before foreign observers in order to establish its relationship with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic change of system.
If the elections were to be declared clean by observers, they would be able to release the sanctions imposed on the country in which 40 Belarusian leaders were denied the visa and some bank accounts were frozen.
However, according to the opposition, the elections did not take place clearly.
"We were deprived of the electoral committees, and our observers were unable to participate in the ballot count" - regretted Yuri Potyemkin, from the twelve parties, so he is a very heterogeneous spokesperson of the United Democratic Forces Coalition.
'The changes were purely nominal' - he stressed Mr Milinkievics, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and the leader of the pro-European movement. 'The point is who is counting the votes and, in our case, this is the executive power.
If the opponents of the opposition enter Parliament, it means that they have been appointed, not elected.
But their access to Parliament will allow them to have a place on television, to sit in the regions of the country and to submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore stand out in political life because 'the dialogue with the European Union must be initiated'.
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt to Russia, is going through a crisis and we are not able to renew itself, we risk being placed under Russia's control.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the outcome of the vote will be accepted as valid by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe following the election process.
They stress that the participation rate seems too high and that the broad organisation of preliminary voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has given any kind of manipulation.
"You have noticed that there was an election here?" - asks the question of the Social Democrat leader of Aleksandr Kozulin, who was released in August this year as the last person to be released from prison, where he was held as a political prisoner.
No one was in the polls.
And there will be up to five opposition representatives in Parliament, and those who are best suited to leadership.
The silence of the night will fall on October Square again.
President Lukashenko and members of the central electoral committee will be delighted on television.
Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of his foundation yesterday. President Francine Décary had good reason to celebrate because Hema-Québec has become one of the world's safest and most effective blood-staining societies.
The most important thing is that he managed to regain people's trust, which was severely shaken by the scandal of blood infection in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves treated by the Canadian Red Cross blood service were infected with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general upheaval, in February 1994, the Canadian Government launched a formal investigation under the leadership of Judge Horace Krever, which was intended to shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to make proposals to avoid future similar cases.
While Judge Krever's late report was submitted, some provinces set up their own committee to plan a new blood management system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood services were established in Canada: one was Hema-Québec, serving Quebec, and the other was the Canadian Blood Protection Company responsible for all other provinces and two territories.
"When Hema-Québec started his activity in 1998, almost 38% of people had confidence in Quebec's blood supply system," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was desperate.
"In the coming years, however, as a result of our work in the field, we managed to regain people's trust." Hema-Québec was proud to declare that at the beginning of 2008 nearly 94% of the population in Quebec believed that hema-Québec was reliable.
But Dr. Décary doesn't forget that "trust is an extremely fragile thing".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
During this period, a number of cases have been revealed in Europe where the new variants of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have infected people, says the doctor, who has been managing the company since its establishment in 1998.
"We had no idea if this disease was spreading by blood.
We therefore relied on one of the most important recommendations in the Krever and Gélineau reports, which means that if we are uncertain about this and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, we must take exclusion measures. In this case, Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which causes the brain to change, inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who have spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
And a few years ago, it was unmistakably established that the disease was spreading by blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999, a technique appeared in the market that allows a much more sensitive diagnosis of the HIV virus. This is a nucleic acid test (NAT), which is capable of directly detecting the virus itself in the blood of blood donors, rather than antibodies to the virus on which the previously used tests were based.
With the help of the NAT test, we could shorten the window period from infection until the virus can be detected in the blood using our technical tools, explains the expert.
This period could be reduced for a period of less than one week.
Thus, they significantly reduced the risk of blood transfusions not only being known but also that this could not be shown.
These developments greatly reduced the risk of AIDS being transmitted by blood transfusions.
Today, there is a risk that someone will be infected with the HIV virus, with 12 million to one.
"In other words, it means that we should distribute 12 million blood products until someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec distributes between 400 and 500 thousand blood products every year, it would take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and for someone to be infected with HIV through a blood product.
I think that anyone today can accept or write blood transfusions to restore health, says Hema-Québec's number one leader.
"The challenge for the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what new pathogen is entering the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, can enter the blood with insect bites.
Therefore, we must be constantly alert," said Dr. Décary, and then stressed that, apart from the emergency reserves, Hema-Québec must provide sufficient permanent reserves.
"Aging the population also increases demands.
Because anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
Population ageing has an impact on blood donors, as the number of people in the network who can donate blood accounts for only 3% of the population in Quebec.
However, every healthy person aged at least 18 years who fulfils the eligibility criteria can give blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have been in a country where malaria destroys are not eligible for blood for a year.
"With this 3 percent we have enough reserves to meet the needs of the hospitals.
It's very rare for us to run out of supplies.
However, we need to increase the number of blood donors to the extent that existing ones grow older because they can't give blood after a while.
However, it is very difficult to convince people to give blood, but it is even more difficult to keep them and make them become regular donors.
In today's rushing world, man has barely an hour to go to give blood" - regrets Francine Décary.
Hema-Québec, a $297 million annual budget, provides not only blood products but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin tissue, which are used almost exclusively for severely burned individuals.
These tissues are analysed, transformed and frozen, and then placed at the Hema-Québec, which also manages a single public stem cell bank in Quebec.
The hair can only be obtained from a cord treated as medical waste from a cord that is rich in stem cells, thus enabling the treatment of serious diseases (e.g. leukaemia).
"We celebrated a few weeks ago that we had entered our bank for the thousandth cord blood sample, and we plan to remove more than a thousand new samples every year.
At the beginning of next year, we are probably starting to offer these for organ transplants," said Dr. Décary, who said that the cord-line-reduction program is very popular these days.
"Many moms are sad that they can't do that" - that's true, because Hema-Québec has no way of making this complex and costly program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Football - in the semifinals of Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounders on USL-1 by 3:1 yesterday and reached the semifinal with a total result of 4:3. This was the second and crucial match of the quarter-final and the finals that took place in Saputo Stadium.
The final goal was scored by Antonio Ribeiro in mid-round at 90 minutes.
While the first half passed without a goal, the second half found two mid-rounders of the Montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, in the opponent's net.
Roger Levesque was the only one on Sounders' team who managed to get Matt Jordan off the hook.
Let's remember, at his first match on Friday, Impact 2:1 was defeated by Starfire Complex in Tukwila, the suburbs of Seattle.
Impact in the semifinal is playing with Vancouver Whitecaps.
Saturday evening, the Thunder team in Minnesota, which won the Whitecaps at 3:1 in the first game, won 4:3, but the Whitecaps came to the semifinal with a total result of 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches will be specified today.
In a nutshell - the winner goal of Kovalev
The Canadiens' favorite triage is waiting for another season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led three great attacks, and eventually the Canadiens won the Florida Panthers in a ratio of 3:2 of the shootings at the Centre Bell last night.
Kostitsyn, the number one star of the meeting, scored a goal. Plekanec ended the match with two goals, and Kovalev finished the match with a goal pass, which was the fourth of the team's six preparatory games.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who got the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet" - warning the Russian player.
"I need one more game to make me feel like I'm really in shape."
"He tried to get too much out of himself in the first third," noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he was happy about the outcome of the game.
He's had a huge ovation."
The northern aspirations of Charest
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will begin this year.
The meeting of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest, has barely ended yesterday, and has already gone to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left) will win the interim election to be held today.
"Retract our last great northern border": this ambitious long-term goal was defined by Jean Chares at his meeting in Levis, Quebec, at the Liberal Party. The speech was enriched with visual elements, while the President tried to focus on the point.
During his performance, behind his back were screened with images similar to "Moulin à images".
The three huge projectors were followed by impressive footage: waterworks dams, mining, Quebec on Google Maps, maps...
Such spectacular instruments are used during election periods.
The Prime Minister refused to guarantee at the press conference that the election would not start this autumn, although he added that his schedule was very tight.
On the fourth pillar of the vision of the future of Prime Minister Quebec, a "new economic area", this includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and a number of conventions planned with Ontario.
Recently, opening up to the North (i.e. the north of the 49th latitude) was often included in the Prime Minister's speeches, but he has never given a lecture on this subject.
The Head of State, however, insisted only on explaining why he considered the North to be "a treasure mine of great potential", but did not mention the time factor, the investment amounts or the specific priority order for future projects.
It has highlighted only a few development opportunities: hydroelectric power plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which are further boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
On the north, he classified Charest as "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This area, which is twice the size of France, is our territory, the territory of Quebec.
It is not just us, it is within us," the Head of State reiterated, stressing that it intends to create a national founding myth.
He highlighted that the development of Quebec was largely determined by the relationship with the North: the golden fever in Abitib, the planned work in Quebec, the Gulf of James...
"This is our future," he added, after taking a styling break, he looked at the huge map behind his back.
The northern part of the Quebec area includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded for itself, said the Prime Minister at the press conference.
"This is our historic resolution, confirmed by all governments.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if there is an opportunity to do so, I reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government", he said.
On the other hand, 'in the light of climate change, we need to reconsider our point of view on the North', the Prime Minister said, speaking of the Northwest Passage which is opened every year as a result of the melting of polar ice.
In the view of the Prime Minister, in this new geopolitical environment, it is an important task to book the area.
What about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec will pay particular attention to them and that the plan will bring many benefits, especially for young people.
The two ministers of the different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (later a delegation from the Hungarian Party Québécois), have already started negotiations with around thirty local communities.
The Interministerial Committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) also played an important role, has begun to operate.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, a "not necessarily a summit", where "a common vision is created".
The development of the North would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan is coordinated, integrated and will be environmentally friendly," the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Charest described this vision as in line with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers before him.
"Just like the former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new growth and development opportunities from the challenges."
This was one of the returning themes of the weekend that began on Friday with the great cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election as party president.
One of the decisions adopted proposes that the Beauharnois power plant be baptized as Adélard-Godbout.
"The politicians of our team, including Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québece, Lesage who carried out the quiet revolution and the national distribution of hydro power plants, or Bourassa who was known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to forge the future," Jean Charest said.
He quoted another work - true, conservative - at the press conference, namely John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister "Roads to the North" between 1957 and 1963.
As regards the plan for the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric barrier, President Charest stressed that the deployment was planned for 2012.
"This should stay between us, but I plan to be there," he said to his followers, and his statement was accepted by loud applause.
The Prime Minister, who even said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of a vote to be held in the autumn this year, which the law also allows him.
He stressed, however, that his calendar is already full, as he has undertaken tasks at the Federal Council meeting in China and at the Quebec-New York Summit.
The party meeting held at the end of the week has proved to be an excellent platform for the Liberal President to express nationalist decisions, which have been approved almost without any thought. It is mainly about 'procedures relating to the Constitution': the Liberal Party demands, in particular, the recognition of 'the special nature of Quebec' in the Constitution.
I would also like Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and these members would be entitled to veto in relation to decisions taken in Quebec.
However, the opposition sceptically accepted the main points of the Northern Plan.
Parti Québécois' leader, Paulina Marois, re-emphasised the North Quebec development policy introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government in power in 2003 refused to apply this policy.
If they had not done so, 'we would have gone a long way ahead', Marois thought in agreement with Mrs. Françoise Mercure, who was the candidate for the vote in Jean-Talon to be held today.
The ADQ supports the opposition party to accept the Northern Plan.
"But we would like this not to be a mere play," noted the party leader Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who is returning from his freedom today.
Letters - A Lost Country
Vic Toews, Minister of Harper's Cabin (otherwise, Minister of Justice) took the courage last summer to call Louise Arbourt Canada a "pity".
So to shame a woman who has fought constantly for the truth and deserves all of our admiration - this tells a great deal about the people surrounding the Prime Minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
This is our government, which has not returned its own citizens from the Guantanamo concentration camp in one of the Western countries concerned.
This is the government that absolutely does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager at the time of the crimes committed to him.
This is the only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, denied its word and allowed a child soldier to subdue under inhuman circumstances.
The only government to make a puppet theater out of justice while investigating a defendant's guilt.
Let us just remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers' Association are also demanding Omar Khadr's return to Canada for a fair trial.
And our government keeps an eye on the tortoise: it doesn't matter to her that a young adult has already been spiritually destroyed, and the many years of torture have probably sealed his fate for life.
Although we are not yet aware of this, our rights, our freedom and our democracy are underminingly destroyed. "Democracy": Harper continues to speak this word, which, out of his mouth, sounds like an empty word.
The time has come, then, when morals no longer exist: they can be arbitraryly beaten, tortured and imprisoned by any Canadian citizen, at the expense of the leader of a government that has so far been in a minority (and what can happen after 14 October...?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found at a party that honors virtue, the Law and the Order. They do not see that this government is at the feet of the values for which the good news and dignity of our country are due.
Dear Mr Toews, the shame is more of this - not elsewhere else to look.
Opinion - The Barrick Gold Orwelli speaker
A letter from Patrick J. Garver, Vice President-President of the Canadian Barrick Gold Mine was published in Le Devoir's 17 September issue.
Following Orwelli's reasoning, Garver states that the world's largest gold-producing company has filed a six-million-dollar indemnity against three authors and a small-time publishing company in order to launch a so-called "public debate".
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their rulings, especially in cases of defamation, are based not on the truth, but on the law.
It's not surprising that Garver has listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
Would Barrick Gold really be the best way for public debate to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to his?
Notwithstanding the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada must spend significant amounts on defence and fight in an unequal fight where on the other hand there is an army of lawyers supported by almost inexhaustible sources of mining industry.
In such an unequal fight, it is often the tactics of destroying the defendant and concluding friendly agreements that not only silence the opposite, but even alarm those who try to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views in front of the public.
Although this is not the case in many other countries where Barrick Gold is active, the debaters in Canada usually do not stick together, but tell their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have been sufficient to open its books and files and prepare for a real debate in press, media, publications, paying for independent research groups that could shed light on the issue.
But it looks like Barrick Gold doesn't trust the public, and he's sweeping the applications and letters for the protection of the authors of Noir Canada with one move.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could initiate a "public" debate if he ignored the opinion of this public at the same time?
In the head of the Vice-President, this word is probably just a word for lawyers paid by bus, not for the whole population of Canada: the meaning of the concept is therefore very narrow.
In a democratic state, even those who value others are free to speak.
Barrick Gold, on the other hand, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that authors and publishers of Noir Canada are primarily supported by the public because it condemns the harsh procedure of the mine.
The public is ready to listen to Barrick and make a verdict, but it would do so on the basis of civilized arguments rather than by a hearing for a lot of people. (In the context of the term 'public debate', Barrick Gold recently called in writing the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to the surreal considerations of Garver, the Barrick Gold procedure is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of all democratic societies.
It denies, as a whole, the right to quote authentic sources, to discuss facts and their interpretations, which form the basis for spiritual activities.
If, in a country like Canada, you can only study and discuss matters that are not popular with the rich companies of today’s world, who will take the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it could do so according to the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to answer that question.
In our university circle, we have been able to deal with disputes, differences of opinion and conflicts for a long time.
The reckless procedure of Barrick Gold shows well that, contrary to his claim, he is not in the mood to engage in an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the Canadian institutions for public debate, and it is time for governments to finally introduce measures that limit legal procedures for such abuses.
Wall Street rescue - Done by Democrats and Republicans
Yesterday, the Bush Government and the Congress of Republican and Democrat leaders finally reached agreement on the economic rescue, which has been the biggest plan since the big economic crisis in the 1930s.
The 700 billion US dollars plan aimed at curbing the financial crisis on Wall Street for months still needs to be approved by the two houses of Congress.
Key points of the plan: to monitor implementation more effectively by Members; new mechanisms to ensure that public money is repaid; new provisions to keep the number of houses occupied due to non-payments; access to the payment of managers of assisted companies.
Henry Paulson, U.S. Minister of Finance, Nancy Pelosi, President of the American Chamber of Representatives, and Judd Gregg, the Republican representative in the trial yesterday, announced the good news a few minutes before midnight after the two-day marathon trial.
"We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets," said Henry Paulson, a representative of the Bush Government.
"We have done everything we can to save the real economy and American citizens from the current crisis on Wall Street," explained the Democrat Representative.
"The most important point is that if we don't do this, then the shock, chaos and confusion in the American everyday lives will be enormous," said Judd Gregg, Republican MP.
The trial was speeded up in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would adversely affect the mood of investors.
The agreement was given a deadline until this morning's opening of the stock exchange.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations late showed their willingness to reach an agreement, however, they were not happy that the situation was increasing to the end.
Senator Barack Obama has attributed to himself the extension of the agreement with elements such as provisions relating to the preservation of house-ownership or the payment of directors of companies assisted by the State.
"When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps because of the irresponsibility of other people, it is not too enjoyable.
These steps, however, are necessary," he noted on an American television show.
When John McCain asked if he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied: "I would like to know the details, but I hope so."
"What I have read in large lines is evident from the fact that it is something that we all need to digest and move on.
The possibility of not doing anything is simply unacceptable," he said.
According to the $700 billion plan, taxpayers' money would buy the suspicious claims of American financial institutions, some unsold assets at risk.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis triggered by the collapse of the real estate register. This led first to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgage loans) and then to the spread of other (commercial) debt securities, resulting in the freezing of liquid resources and the fragility of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was failed by a group of Republican Members last week.
It seems that we have been able to get out of this dead end since the Democrats have agreed to ensure that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are provided by the government rather than by the government.
In order to be satisfied with all the members of Congress, a provision has been included in the plan which provides that if the government has to bear losses within the programme for five years, it may levy new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a 250 billion-dollar instalment would be paid for the first time; it could be followed by an additional 100 billion if the President deems it necessary.
The remaining $350 billion should be approved by Congress by another vote.
In exchange for the aid, Washington will acquire a share in the supported companies, through which it will receive dividends from profits and which it can sell after the crisis has resolved.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure of real estate to cover the mortgage loans covered by the plan, and may also set a maximum value for remuneration and pay for the management of companies affected by the crisis.
The plan makers would like the plan to be voted by the House of Representatives today and the Senate on Wednesday.
However, despite their efforts, the plan is still not yet approved.
Yesterday, the opposition to the plan has been repeated among both the Republicans and the Democrats.
"It is perfectly clear that Washington will not hear your voice," declared Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Financial Committee.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there's no one that would benefit taxpayers."
Brad Sherman, the Democrat Member who led the small assembly group called the 'sceptical Group', is presenting things differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economic experts, including three Nobel Prize-winning scientists, wrote to us to ask Congress: do not hurry and look closely at which path to choose," Sherman said yesterday.
In Europe, at the same time, it was once again understood that this was a global crisis.
After a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they would nationalise part of the Fortis banking group to a value of EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy its competitors on the verge of bankruptcy after losing EUR 2 million (EUR 2.9 billion) as a result of the US secondary mortgage crisis.
Fortis with 85 000 employees is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurance companies.
"It's not thrown away money," said Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
"In exchange, we acquire voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households greatly appreciate now that the situation promises to be uncertain."
Meanwhile, across La Manche, the British government seems to be preparing to nationalise another bank that has been driven away by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over the total amount of ongoing loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which real estate loans amount to £41 billion ($75.5 billion).
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that they would buy the British bank's subsidiaries and client stocks.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank that the British government has wanted to publicise since the start of the crisis after Northern Rock.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the actor server
Some say that the eyes of beautiful azurks were his main card, others say that he had his greatest weakness.
Have you ever gotten rid of the mirror of Narcissian American actor with a charming smile?
Yeah, I don't, I don't.
Through his shame, sensitivity, and inborn talent, he was also far removed from the harsy style, which is the spirit of the great monstrosities of the art world.
But what a huge field he's run in!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer at 83 years of age on Friday at Connecticut's estate, one of the last icons of American cinema's flower age.
There was less monumental personality than Brando, whom he looked like, and who was a rival for a long time on the screen. His roles were more restrained and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also declared freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
Blood mixing often causes extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio as a child of a Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
European roots have contributed to the creation of a symbolic form of American dream.
He didn't think too much of himself, which just increased his merit.
In the early 1950s, he studied at the drama of Yale University, and then at the Aktor's Studio in New York before the theater, television, and soon thereafter broke into the world of cinema.
In addition to being a champion of civil rights, he won second place as a racer in 1979 in the Le Mans 24-hour race. Moreover, he was considered a sex symbol, although he has been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we can never find out what shades he had of this mysterious, closed-minded actor's life devoted to his work, who hated the glamour of show-business.
He was an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked the movie fans: in his great roles we can only see it on the black screen of memories.
Looking at his work of life, the seventh American art has been standing before us for over 50 years.
We remember the charming cowboy of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and the cold young man from his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), whose role we saw in the Tennessee Williams processing of "The Cat on the Hot Doll" in 1958.
From recent times (1990) we can remember Mr. Bridge, who is vulnerable to his old age by not changing his hopes.
Paul Newman has also had a lot of other faces in his movies.
In Robert Wise's film "Alive Up there", he gave an unforgettable performance in the role of the stormy criminal boxer Rocky Graziano. This was originally intended for James Dean - and took over after his death - started Newman's acting career in 1956.
He also played a nice criminal in the brilliant film "The Great Trouble", which won the Oscar for the best film in 1973.
Robert Rossen in his brilliant film "The Svindler" (1961) played a bitter, vengeful billiard player and returned in a similar role to Martin Scorsese in his film "The Color of Money".
It's changing times, but it's always the same face: it was him.
It's always been like this.
The period of his career was marked by a change in the ages.
The younger ones are known mainly from George Roy Hill's cult film "The Icebreakers" (1977), where Reggie Dunlop, the coach of an ice-kong team, is not a very common method.
His fans saw him in "The Great Jump", quoted by the Coen brothers, back in 1994.
The series was closed in 2003 by Sam Mendes' film "The Way of Harm": this was the last time he appeared in the role of an Irish Mafia leader.
Unlike many cinematographers who left the screen relatively soon, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with its glamour, glamour, and hypocrisy.
French film director Bertrand Tavernier didn't think of it as a "live underplay" without all the humors: his game was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always merciful with handsome Paul Newman, who for a long time had just fallen into his lap with the movie roles.
Yet, he played a rarely young and successful character: rather, he formed figures on the edges of society — nervous, alcoholic, malicious or hopeless — whose drifting and rebellion he was able to return with perfect credibility.
As a director, Newman showed a less well-known face: a truly gloomy and sensitive man in the depths of his soul.
In 1968, he drew a fine portrait of a melancholy woman with Joanne Woodward in the main role, in the film "Rachel, Rachel" (adaptation of the Canadian writer Margaret Laurence's novel).
With the film "Harry and Son" in 1984, he commemorates his son Scott, who died in drug overdose.
Yesterday, Newman's many admirers remembered the actor and his close friend Robert Redford (with whom they played together in "The Great Trouble" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") said, "His presence made my life better and the world better.
Generousness and the joy of being: this was the secret of the vibrating personality of this great actor, whom we have now lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his struggle for civil rights, the environment, independent film production and his criticisms of Hollywood's outbursts are clouded.
We've seen her face smile on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits, and other foods, and she did it with a pretty bad taste of mouth, although she thought it was funny at first.
However, revenues from such sales have always been transferred to a fund for children suffering from the disease.
Newman never sat on his laurels: he remained committed to the profession.
In his letter to his five daughters, he wrote the following sentences: "Your father has always and all along been imaginably grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here."
It is a privilege for us to follow the course of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What was produced at Zuschlag & Tsai's account factory?
Soon, on October 8, the trial of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates begins.
The politician and his associates are accused of fraud and other crimes, including counterfeiting, which have caused particularly significant damage in the criminal organisation.
According to the D.A., the awarded tender funds were used for their own purposes and the performance of the tasks was often verified by untrue accounts.
In total, the state and municipal funds, some HUF 65 million, have been transferred to the Young Left Bank and some to the pockets of individuals.
The method also described by the investigating authority was that the tender funds received were drawn up on the basis of cost invoices which were not actually executed and that the associations had never complied with the commitment they had entered into.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were fake.
In these markets, invoice blocks were acquired, and the stamps were manufactured on Kiskunhalas.
And the name of which companies is to be accounted for, among other things, on the Balaton-upland tour to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to his last statement, he had to look like a Christmas tree and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice on the consumption there, which was then modelled on the accounts to be submitted, inter alia, for applications from the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Social and Labour case, and the Municipality of Helsinki.
Most of these were noted by István Lados with his partner, András Vári, who, according to our information, wrote most of the reports needed to receive the support.
One of Lados' study trails was a brewery.
According to the two accounts issued by the Zuschlags in 2003, the restaurant provided a meal for the 90-person group of the Commissioners' Association.
However, according to the manager, they could not have access to the catering site at the same time.
Similarly, the Bill for the Better Future - later Together, the Third Thousands of Year - issued to the Foundation in the summer of 2002 was inspired by errors in the form and content of the invoice.
A Bed and Breakfast pension in Badacsonytomaji was only three rooms; more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, but the account was about one hundred and thirty guests.
But the fantasian forms were out of line even when they marked Pigal Kft., which, according to the information given to the prosecution, did not contain documents on Better Future and Hoppa's name.
The head of the company, Győr Farkas told Hvg.hu that when they called him in and showed him bills, he knew it was fake documents.
"The stamp was in the wrong place with our company's name and tax number."
He added: besides formal reasons, the fact that hundreds of people were housed according to the bill did not mean that they had a total of eleven rooms with no room for access.
In addition, the account was for a meal, while their restaurant was not working long ago.
The busiers did not look into the fact that the travel agency in Budapest only organises foreign travels, so in a bourgeois way they marked travel to Hungary as a service in the cash-payment account, which was also not the same as the company's account-issuing practice.
In addition, as the investigation revealed, VAT was included in the document, even though the travel activity to countries outside the European Union was VAT-free.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was wrong in the four documents issued by Hotel Révfölöp Kft. for the Right Future, since the company’s service was not charged with 25 per cent VAT, but with 15 per cent VAT, and the hotel’s employees only issued a machine invoice, while the invoice produced was manual.
In addition, the "exhibitors" have ruined the account by identifying road freight transport as carried out in the case of a company - through the prosecution procedure - which was not carried out by the company based on investment advice.
In addition, due to formal differences - inadequate account format, not real stamp - the accounts for the Third Millennium Foundation, the 21st century Cultural Association and the Commissioner Point have also emerged.
As with Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehérto Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that the invoices had been issued by them.
For example, the counterfeiters did not pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft. was in liquidation at the time (2001) when the group of the Young City Association was eating there, which is why the company's liquidator, as we know, denied that he had issued the paper.
I was made aware of
The other group of account issuers is those who were aware that they had to issue a fictitious account.
The Opportunity for Budapest Foundation has issued an invoice at the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists for the Third Millennium Foundation, for some HUF 4 million.
The leader of Collab Kft. - according to the indictment - was led by one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic.
He also cooperated with the Zuschlags with the Biogate Kft., currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided the Right Future Foundation, the Atlas Association and the Red Fleet Association with accounts of roughly HUF 5 million, which did not have a real economic activity behind it.
Even the money movement, because the completed accounts were then downloaded, but the organizations have forgotten to include this in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing the invoice includes those that may be linked to the defendants.
Thus, Iván Kubatov, the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., is based in Budapest in the field of fuel and motor vehicle trade.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of IT equipment, worth about HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these accounts were purchased by Cash Investment Ltd., Kiskunhalais, who has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
This company was run by a Romanian man who would also have forwarded documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
In the course of the investigation, we understand that Cuba has acknowledged that on behalf of Kft, she has issued an invoice to Atlas, Hoppa and the Third Millennium Foundation, and that she has taken their consideration.
Romanian stoneworkers founded Fa-Bani Jos Fapari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. at the request of Iván Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked, which, according to the defendant, was the reason they didn't get a job.
However, the companies benefited because, at the request of the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also created the papers of the companies, he issued invoices to associations associated with Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation on behalf of the companies.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave 15 invoices to the organisations, worth HUF 14,2 million.
The D.A.'s office believed that 10% of the amounts in the accounts and VAT hit Cuba's mark.
The man even used Si-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious accounts, these were manufactured for the Commissioner's Point application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation and the Association submitted an application for Modern Hungary to the socialist party's public benefit organisation, Mihály Dancesics Foundation (TMA).
They also won HUF 500-500 thousand, but the amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
In order not to find out about this, the Works Team Kft. submitted five fictitious accounts to TMA.
These accounts were found in the search for the house in Árpád Kemecsei's office at the educational wallet.
Some of the defendants at the trial, as they did at the D.A.'s office, are likely to report on the process of account production.
The most interesting thing is that you are the first-ranking defendant, János Zuschlag decides to turn the veil on everything.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised to speak in full, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether the socialists have made a deal with him in the head of the 50 million forints of damage, and Zusi is taking the fall.
By the way, who may have been offended today, since his requests to alleviate the circumstances of his detention, i.e. to put him in house arrest, have been constantly found in deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes that cause much more damage and do not pay for it can walk freely or at least wait in their own homes for the end of the proceedings against them, he does not have the opportunity to do so.
The psychology of over-licitation: why are we giving out more money?
In the auctions, buyers tend to issue more money, overvalue the goods.
The neurological-economic foundations of this known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been revealed to neurologists and economists at the University of New York.
According to their study in Science magazine, people do not want to miss a type of competition, such as the eBay auction, so they pay too much.
The research tried to map this "play" nervous system scheme using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers lotteryd, the other group participated in the player auction while the active brain areas of the experimental subjects were examined using the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method.
In both games, the participants could win money, but during the auction game - in which the over-licitation of the other party is an essential element - the stritaum under the cortex became active intensively when the game was lost.
This brain space plays a role in the mechanism of the nervous system "remuneration" in addition to several other functions.
Researchers therefore believe that the price rise can be explained by avoiding a sharp reaction to the striatium.
In support of their theory, the members of the economic operator of the research group also carried out financial follow-up studies.
In this, three groups bid against one partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product concerned and made their bets.
In addition, another group was promised that if they were to get out of the game, they would receive another $15.
The third group, on the other hand, received 15 dollars before the auction, but the members of the group lost this money in the event of the loss of the auction.
The difference between the two groups, therefore, was all that was emphasised for one of them to win, and for the other to lose.
However, by proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team playing against "loss" were willing to bet higher than the control and win group.
"These results cannot be derived from any pre-existing economic theory.
To date, they have only explained the events of the auction with the joy of victory and risk avoidance.
Only the neurological imaging methods helped to solve the contradiction between these two theories, and now we have a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
Around half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
Hundreds of thousands of people are infected at home, but only seven thousand are treated, which is why patients often do not know that they are infected.
The designation of hepatitis is the common name of the liver problems caused by different viruses.
Their symptoms are of many similarities, characterised by inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are different.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the food canal (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (conjunctival, vaginal fluid, saliva).
Travellers should definitely be vaccinated against the A and B viruses, with no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis Symptoms occur between two and three weeks after the infected food is consumed, generally feeling unwell, weakness, abdominal complaint, with nausea.
After these develops yellowing on the skin and on the whites of the eyes, the stools are clear, the urine becomes dark and healing can take two or three weeks.
A million people a year die from a more severe disease in the world, liver cancer caused by hepatitis B, and liver cancer.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people will receive medication.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to hepatic contraction and liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease, because the pathogen subtly destroys the liver cells, in many cases only 20-30 years from now the first symptoms will occur.
Early prevention and regular screening are therefore very important.
In three groups, there are far more than average cases of such illness: people who have undergone blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
The world currently has 200 million people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus.
Since the disease may already be detected by a routine laboratory test, it is advisable to seek medical advice if any symptoms of unknown origin are detected.
Recognizing the disease in time can be cured, the virus can be removed from the body, thus eliminating the potential for infection and preventing cancer from developing.
September 30th is the World Day of Hepatitis, which was the first organised in 2004 by patient organisations around the world.
Its purpose is to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of their development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God hurt less?
According to a recent study, religious faith acts as a kind of painkiller that could have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment, examining how God’s faith affects people’s sense of pain and reported British Telegraph.
In the course of a rather bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and the same atheists were given electrolysis while all of them studied a painting of the Virgin Mary.
The results show that Catholic believers were able to rule out most of the pain.
Thanks to the human brain detection technique, Catholics have also been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for controlling pain.
The study is the first in a series of research involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university, in addition to academics.
The test was carried out precisely by strengthening a sparkling device to the left hand of the subject, which provided the electric shock.
The researchers asked the experimenters to take a strong look at two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would create a religious state among believers, while the image of da Vinci was chosen because it was not too different from the other and was considered to be soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time they received 20 electrocutions in four consecutive parts, either on a religious subject or on a general picture.
Catholics reported that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" as they were "cared for" and "required, filled with peace".
When looking at the religious picture, 12 percent less pain was reported than when Leonardo’s creation was seen before them.
Miguel Farias, a psychologist who himself participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any strong image, also with atheists, only the appropriate photo should be found.
"We should find a picture of someone they feel very positive about, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the search.
"The exercise of faith should change, and in many cases it changes our personality," he added.
After the great results, the question is, if Leonardo or a similar caliber painter showed a picture of a madonna to the believers, how would that affect their pain control?
Would the vision of the Quality Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On your 10th birthday, Google can tell us: you can find at least as much in people’s pockets as you can in the sky; you know where you have been vacationed, what special orders you have and what interests them.
And that's still not enough Eric Schmidt, according to one of the company's main employees.
But as for the sceptics that are parallel to the Orwell horror, they don't see exactly the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently said to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect more personal data about their users, and this is necessary to keep themselves in line with the original goal of the Google founders, which said, "Let's bring all the information in the world into the system!".
According to the Google leader, after ten years of world-wide work, the company is still at the beginning of the process of handling all information.
To the question of what happens in five years' time, Schmidt replied: would you like Google to be able to answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What kind of work should I really do?" - but until then, the software will not be able to answer such simple questions because they do not know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware of the exact location of their search terms, the IP address they were searching for, and the site that interested them after searching.
Through Personalized Search, which started two years ago, users can store their own surfing background history, look back at what they were looking for, what they were looking for, and this will provide them with much better personalized results in the long term - the Recommendations will be based on the same logic, which will provide us with products and services based on our previous preferences.
What if they use my data against me when they look at what I do? - the users who are worried about seeing the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, the amount of potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or rebellion against power in Internet users will trigger counter-reactions.
However, the confirmed fact that all the words sought are not only recorded, but may, where appropriate, be transferred to a third party, in such legal cases, there is nothing to protect the privacy of Internet users.
Perhaps the loudest example of this in recent times was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google provided the Brazilian Government with information on pedophiles from the social site Orkut it maintains to enable identification.
In May, however, Internet players concerned with privacy rights were allowed to rise when the company successfully proved the truth in the court against the FBI, in agreement with the EFF's electronic law-enforcement organisation: according to which, at any point in the constitution, Google cannot be forced to provide any information requested secretly by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought out some 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it obtained by reference to the confirmation of the Child Protection Act adopted years earlier, but failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and to obtain a full list of websites and keywords for two months.)
Therefore, Google's assessment is rather controversial: those who fear the provision of their personal data feel that their intimate spheres and privacy are being undermined by the use of Google's services and by the rebellion of several companies in conservative imagery.
Meanwhile, the hunt of American gay culture and its enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users in many countries sees the next generation of large companies, the "fashive corporation" in them, unlike their rivals, Microsoft, registered as a world conqueror for Windows, no matter how much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because, unlike Microsoft, Google does not request a user identification code, does not ask for money for its applications, an open, free, continuously updated source code and program package that makes it much more accessible, younger, cooler than the official software giant practice.
However, it may also happen that the geeks are able to understand precisely the very problematic relationship between personality rights and the Internet, which has been the subject of one of the most frequently spoken keywords of recent years, the web 2.0.
Because Web 2.0 is about collaborating, leaving clues behind and using the communication channels available to us, and while their levels vary from one person to another, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
An average young person can use several social media profiles from Facebook to Xang, link them to other services, such as Twitter or a child that lists their musical habits.fm, and then all of them can be linked to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and can also use blogs that automatically display their latest photo galleries that are stored on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can read about a number of examples that illustrate: the girlfriend can easily find out when she sees the morning photo of the common circle of friends, who a fraudulent friend has spent the evening with, or can fire a company's employee only because she writes her honest opinion on the top management blog: a certain concept of privacy has been completely revalued by now.
One who lives online is what he shows himself, and that is the foundation behind the conduct of today’s young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something or at least wants to avoid the Google monopoly can do it (starting with Scroogle, for example, using Google's search system but not leaving a trace).
For example, the number of people who are not intended to register on social sites to prevent them from being picked up can be replaced by alternative versions of Google's online applications from the text editor to the image editor and newsreader that are not linked to huge server parks and that do not create the best profile we have so far.
The public is not so secretly waiting for Google to show the protein of its teeth.
The company's current value of 156 billion dollars is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($ 124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising sites are threatening advertising agencies' revenues, and services introduced at an increasing pace are causing serious headaches not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
However, critical opinionators also find counter-measures affecting these concerns: for example, the senior management completely rejected the protest of employees, after doubled the company's kindergarten fee, the company management found the employee's meal to be expensive at all times a day, but it is all drenched out in the fact that in 2006 Google was still leading the Chinese government and, according to their agreement, the company is taking out all the hits that violates good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that they do not advertise a new service in advance, only when it can be used, but the problems of the coming months and years can move the world at a new point: while some people believe that Google's book and magazine engineering and architectural project will have such dimensions that the company will soon have to face the US Supreme Court, others will be afraid of the health system, because in this we can build a full health profile with our previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can also provide a good source for the next generation of science fiction writers, the popular Cory Doctorow novel, Scroogled, describes the future in which a person can only be alarmed by Google data.
Two young people helped the double killer in Osdia's exorcism.
Two juveniles were questioned by the police in the case of the double murder in Ozd, and they were suspected to assist in the cover-up of the crime, said the spokesperson of the State Police Department of Borsod on Tuesday.
Young people have acknowledged the burden on them; they are currently accused of prosecuting them.
The two youngsters, according to MTI information, are defending two girls on the loose.
Penalty may also be punishable by imprisonment for up to five years.
The suspect in the double murder in Ozd - a 23-year-old local man - was placed in custody on Sunday.
Premeditated, profit-making, a crime of multiple human murder.
The investigation revealed that a 23 - year - old man owed a higher amount to a 53 - year - old man.
The suspect didn't want to settle his debt, so he lured his creditor to a post in Ozd last Wednesday, where he killed him, and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI information, the young man was preparing to commit the crime, and this is also evidence that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the scene.
The police are investigating the weapons and the conditions of use with the assistance of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - some five billion Czech kroons - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of the 100 percent stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Polish despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously excluded by the Czechs from any new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in public control.
99% of the shares are held by the Polish State, which intends to sell more than 60% of the papers over a few months.
The Czech Economic Day of E15 is new to know that the Polish offer is the highest amount offered by the interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech papers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Exchange have submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, the manager of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner and did not rule out that this would lead to the elimination of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated at 5-10 billion kroons by market experts.
According to the shareholder agreement, about 90 % of the paper could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank by 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. by 13.5%.
The financial crisis from a European perspective
In their Tuesday comments dedicated to the growing international financial crisis, the European newspapers have already referred to the 'second of September'.
The global financial disaster is due to the President of the United States - accused by the Roman La Repubblica - the President was not even able to list his own party behind the bill, which was put together in the face of this wound, aimed at remedying the desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor mentioned by a billionaire investor, Warren Buffett is more appropriate to talk about the second of September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has led the world economy to collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and then the whole world will suffer.
The Bush plan was not perfect, but, following the Congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington will not provide a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just when one of the biggest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored - pointed to by the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Today, some states are still able to provide a lifeline for the supporting financial institutions, and they can save them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
However, if more banks collapse like dominocas, neither the funds nor any further increments will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and centralise the control of fragmented financial markets.
Only on Monday did the illegitimate financial institutions receive more than EUR 100 billion - reminds us of the Vienna Der Standard, which says that the concerns that, like the Americans, European taxpayers need to go deep into their pockets in order to remedy the crisis are becoming increasingly realistic.
The EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis that is sweeping the old continent as a tsunami.
The 'rescue' does not have to be about a hundred billion euros, but it would be a good thing if I were to fix it: in which case it would be reasonable to reach the taxpayers' money in order to prevent more damage.
The Dongo Flight Implicated by the Intelligent Car
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid collision if it were not to imitate barriers in the world of nature?
For example, bees.
In the surprising project at CEATEC, in Japan, the dongo bees gave the strategic idea to the engineers of Nissan to build the next generation of conflict prevention systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built the BR23C bio-replicated car robot control system, a robotised mini-car, which was equipped with the properties of bees, with the ultimate aim of contributing to the development of a system that eliminates all collisions.
While flying, each bee develops its own oval-shaped personal space, which is in fact very similar to our safety cover - explained Kazuhhiro Doi at the exhibition, technological PR- and R & D brand director.
The role of the complex eye of the uterus is important, which can be seen in all directions at more than 300 degrees angles.
To copy the complex eye function, engineers reached out to the idea of a laser telescope.
It identifies obstacles within a distance of 2 m at a distance of 180 degrees at BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns into an action to avoid impact.
During the fraction of the second, the obstacle is detected, and then the car robot, mimicking the movement of the uterus, changes the direction immediately by turning its wheels to the extent necessary to avoid impact.
In any way other than the current system, this avoiding manoeuvre is performed in a completely intuitive way.
"If this were not the case, the car robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car robot project.
Incentive and immediate response, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of safety shields, a layer within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does in order to avoid other bees.
This process should take place in a moment.
However, in a way other than bees, the deviation should not be directed upwards, downwards or transversely, only in two-dimensional directions, and only in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibility available to bees to avoid other bees, only rotational movement and acceleration, as well as deceleration, have been used as an option for car robot.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are easier and have a higher energy density, which means that they have a longer life span than the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, the intellectual intelligence response is important, not the ability to process and store data even less.
This device only needs to process and respond to a few input signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and react with intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvring data, so it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There's no need for gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step towards the development of the immediate escape technology, which, based on Nissan's estimate, could be involved in serial cars within 10 years.
The integration of the unit with the GPS-satellite navigation system may be an additional application to prevent obstacles on the road leading the car to the specified end goal.
He's got a name for the precious kid.
The written version of the $700 billion Economic Rescue Package Act, which is applicable in several details, is now being used to buy bad bank loans.
In the first round, half of the amount is spent.
According to the Eastern Coastal Time, during further discussions until after midnight on Saturday, Congressional leaders have come to an end in a day-long debate about a total of $700 billion rescue package, the Reuters reported.
We have made serious progress, said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic President of the American House of Representatives, who said that only the agreement has been written down.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
As regards the outcome of the compromise, Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said that the programme will work and be effective, but there is also a need for further work to be done. Pelosi says that this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the wagon of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets in Washington time on Sunday night 8 (i.e. Monday at 2:00 p.m.) but did not cause a spectacular upturn in the stock exchange.
The Parliament will first vote on the draft law on the law, which will be subject to the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act, and then the Senate will take place on Monday.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and then at the White House they welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made last night and appreciate the efforts made by the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, the White House spokesperson.
By the way, the programme is different from the initial proposal of the Bush Administration, which would have been about spending $700 billion on a low-quality, credit-backed securities.
For the first time, no more than half of the 700 billion dollars can be spent immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on Monday, from which the Ministry of Finance will buy low-valued securities, and the fate of another 100 billion dollars will depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be monitored by a separate body, including the President of the Federal Reserve.
The spending of the other half of the 700 billion depends on the new Congress decision.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can use combined tactics: at the same time, it can buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage securities, as well as other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase takes place in the framework of auctions and can take place directly, announced by the Ministry's competent authorities.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme where the financial wallet guarantees the means of concern for which companies will pay a premium corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary means to get up to $700 billion to the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether buying bad assets widely or insurance, or avoiding the systemic risk of a collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, he added.
However, the managers of the banks that are in trouble and awaiting state aid can expect their withdrawal money to be restricted by the government, which is simply called a golden parachute by the overseas slang.
Payments are restricted only in certain cases, and the limitations depend on how the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
In essence, the restriction means that if the Ministry buys in the framework of the auction, additional taxes will be imposed on the gold parachute, unless they send it to retirement for the retired bank manager.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that management money is not excessive.
The picture includes the fact that existing gold parachuting agreements do not change, the restriction only applies to new ones, so as to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first time in American history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs - he commented on the measure by the chairman of the House's Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, the Democratic Party.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the State acquires the right to acquire shares, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can ultimately win the transaction as the economy and the rescue bank stand together.
The draft law states that in the next five years, the President will have to submit to Congress a presentation on how to return the expected losses from the financial sector to taxpayers.
There were, of course, people on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, that is to say it does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said Darrell Issa, a Republican Member of California.
A Democrat colleague in Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believed that the measures were being encouraged by the same people who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to increase
Domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, by 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007, according to KSH.
The prices of export sales to industry were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008, with a decrease of 3.9 per cent from one year earlier.
As a result of domestic and export price changes, industrial producer prices were 0.7 per cent higher than in the previous month and 3.2 per cent higher than one year earlier.
Domestic sales prices of the industry increased only to a minimum of 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in manufacturing industries also increased slightly by 0.1 per cent compared to July.
The biggest increase in prices occurred in August 2008 in the leather product sector (2.8%), mainly due to a price increase of 4.6% in the production of bags, straps and 2.5% in the production of footwear per month.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the production of the chemical, product, at the prices of the industry (1.6%).
There was a fall in the price of oil processing (1.4 percent), electric machinery, instrument production (0.9 percent) and, to a minimum, wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices of paper production, publishers and printing activities have not changed.
In the other manufacturing sectors, we measured a price increase of 0.2 per cent to 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which represent a significant weight in domestic sales of the industry, prices increased by 0.3% in August, in particular as a result of the long-term impact of the official gas price increase carried out from 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, prices increased most in the oil processing sector (32.4 per cent) in terms of domestic sales of the processing industries.
The production of metal-processing products in the sector was accompanied by an increase of 13.2 percent in the price of food, drink and tobacco production, representing a major weight.
The decrease in prices occurred in the textile, textile (2.5 percent) and electrical machinery and instrument production (0.3 percent).
In other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price increase ranged from 0.6 per cent to 9.1 per cent.
Prices have increased by 10.2 per cent over the last year in the manufacturing industry as a whole.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors exceeded 18.7% of the previous one year.
In domestic sales, among the target groups in the sectors, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was seen in the sector producing investment goods in August.
In the consumer product industries, prices have increased by 0.3 per cent, and in the energy and downstream sectors, prices have not changed compared to the previous month.
Compared to the same month of the previous year, in August 2008, the largest price increase was observed in energy and downstream sectors (16.8%).
In the consumer goods sector, we measured a 6.8 per cent increase in prices, a 1.4 per cent decrease in investment goods.
The export sales prices of the industry in Forint increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month and decreased by 3.9 per cent in 12 months.
Our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 per cent in a month compared to the euro, by 7.1 per cent compared to the dollar, and by 7.5 per cent compared to the euro compared to August 2007, by 15.9 per cent compared to the dollar.
You don't need a visa for the United States next year?
Göncz Kinga has a good chance that the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force around 12 January - the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarians.
In his view, "now everything depends only on the timely deployment of the electronic access and control system across the sea".
At the same time, he pointed out that there would be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy is currently negotiating in Washington.
He will meet with Minister of Foreign Affairs Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will present the Middle Cross of the Hungarian Republic's Honorary Order to the Star and will hold discussions with the foreign policy advisors of the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and President John McCain.
The bank rescue package is supported by Barack Obama and McCain
Barack Obama and John McCain, president of the two large American parties, both supported the government's $700 billion rescue aid package on Sunday, but there is a politician who demands the Minister of Finance's resignation.
After days of negotiations between Congress and representatives of the administration in marathon, it was announced at Sunday morning: they concluded a principle agreement on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package aimed at melting the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain also make themselves known: they are more suitable to lead the country out of the economic crisis than their competitors.
According to the latest surveys, Obama once again gained some advantage with the focus on economic issues, the advantage of McCain, which he acquired after the Republican Convention, was nominated by Vice-President Sarah Palin.
Obama expressed hope at a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday that the 700 - billion - dollar bill would be quickly adopted by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal included consumer protection passports which he supported.
"Now we must act with responsibility (...) in your position, in your savings, in all industries, in danger of the stability of the economy as a whole," he said before the 35 thousand masses.
He didn't miss calling McCain's economic ideas overdue.
McCain explained in his interview with ABC that "we will all have difficulty swallowing it (...) but doing nothing is simply not a way to go".
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal included the setting up of the Finance Minister’s Supervisory Committee and the restriction on the termination of senior executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role to play in the negotiations, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
On Sunday, House President Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would hopefully vote on the bill on Monday.
German Language Area Sheet
The camp on the right is intact, but only within the camp have the voters become more conscious - this is how Der Spiegel analyses the weak role of CSU in Bavaria.
Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent the Red-Black Coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In an online edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter, the Bavarian Revolution, analyses the causes of CSU’s dramatic defeat.
According to the known Politologist, CSU's erosion began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over.
For decades, the Christian socialists renewed Bavaria, and these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of age is also the problem of the whole Christian democracy, and so is Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising for CSU, but a process ended on Sunday, which was almost exactly ten years ago likely: the undisputed hegemony of a state party has ceased.
For ten years now, CSU landed 47.7% in 1998, for the first time since the 50s, below the 50 percent level.
This has been repeated three years in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so he mentioned so much in the Stoiber era.
This is because CSU has consistently implemented modernisation in the province, which eats its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong at the pace. However, the loyalty of the voters CSU could not have had any consequences for secularization, educational outcomes, the establishment of the East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and its political consequences are visible.
The camp on the right is intact, only within the camp have the electors become more conscious, more critical, more stubborn.
It is also remarkable that, in the last few weeks, it was the classic civil groups that have left the CSU most of all; the liberals, the industrialists, the graduates and the graduates.
The CSU's support has been shrinked below 40%.
Die Presse (dipresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper "Who Who? The party presidents deal with the confusing domestic political situation that arose after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ interference in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not want to discuss the coalition.
The election has taken place, now everything is around the coalition; in the debate on public service television, party leaders barely allowed access to their cards.
President Werner Faymann confirmed his intention to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ also wants to show that it is possible to cooperate between the two parties - in some provinces and in the social partnership.
The question of whether a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - with the current president of the ÖVP, as a beginner - could be imagined - was left open by Faymann.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was awarded anyway.
The repetition of this direction is not mentioned.
Molterer reacted with caution to the red offers.
As you said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann tries to intervene in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether your party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition, for the time being fully open in the party, questions must be discussed within the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider BZÖ has repeatedly shown himself to be open in all directions.
"To prevent the Red-Black Coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility," said Haider.
Warlock: To break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Gender Equality was launched, which is the host of the French Presidency of the European Union this year.
Lívia Járóka, a Fidesz representative of the European People's Party, drew attention to educational segregation in his message to the plenary as one of the main speakers of the professional council, because this is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children and, moreover, the most serious obstacle to their validity.
The high-level conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - was opened by Mr Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Mr Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, the European social partners and the most important European law enforcement and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities have been invited to the meeting.
Járóka - according to the Press Office of the Fidesz EP Group - warned that, apart from discrimination in recruitment, the Roma, mainly due to their low education, are excluded from the labour market.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have secondary education and because of low-quality primary education, only a minor part of them can obtain higher education".
Járóka also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education has a key role to play in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children could mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to raise awareness of these links in the widest circle - including between the Roma and non-Romanians.
The sooner the Roma student starts school, the chances of becoming productive members of the labour market will increase; they will contribute to the national budget through taxes paid after income and consumption.
"The Roma must guarantee their right to quality education on the basis of their right to EU citizenship and guarantee the elimination of their low-quality and separate education", said Lívia Járóka.
The honourable Member believes that the objective of the European Union and its action-oriented coordination are essential for the immediate acceleration of school desegregation processes, for which proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, and to give Roma children the opportunity of democracy to contribute to the future of Europe as a full citizen", Járóka called for.
In the light of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, which has been held annually since last year's Berlin meeting, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities aims to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: Grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, they will decide on the fate of the deported Huber-Beckstein duo.
Despite the ugly fall in the election, the heads have not fallen, and the summits of the Bajoran CSU have already missed the discussion of personal issues.
President Erwin Huber and Governor of Günther Beckstein will remain in his seat, asking how long the grace will last.
The fate of the 17-percent disaster-death tandem will be determined by an extraordinary party stress on the last weekend of October.
In any event, the members of the much - criticised couple felt that they did not insist on their seats with all their strength.
In this way, they sought to calm down the angry members of the group and the base, who, one day after "bajor tsunami", demanded personal convents for the loss of an absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career, the Christian Social Union gained 60.7%, but now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, it ran only 43.4 percent of its power.
For 46 years, the CSU has been a "separate ruler" in Bavaria, which accounts for 18% of German GDP.
The conservatives continue to count heavily in the southern province of the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will certainly be forced to make a coalition.
As one of the first signs of internal restructuring, Vice-President Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister of Agriculture, who is the potential successor of Huber, will also be given a place in the narrow reconnaissance team that will start negotiations with free voters on a possible government coalition in Munich with the liberal FDP and along the right-wing values.
The strange thing about fate is that Gabriele Pauli, whose act against Stoiber was used as a double coup option by Huber-Beckstein, will be enacted in the Free Electoral List, and then he was spared by the ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now turning all their energy into some kind of stabilisation of Beckstein.
In the transition, Stoiber, the former Prime Minister and former CSU president of the Province, called 28 September the most desperate day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some eptical remarks to the CDU, saying they deserved much more support from the brotherhood.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag election due in September 2009, Merkel will not be a Chancellor if the CSU, which has a significant role in the 2005 national success, is not put on its feet in any way.
According to Merkel, his disappointment over the fiasco, the loss of CSU soil will not have a negative impact on the large coalition in Berlin.
Which, of course, is relative: the injured CSU will not be easier to deal with, and the crisis of social Democrats will continue.
The SPD has achieved its weakest result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko additive: 110-0
No opposition Member has entered the Belarusian Parliament following the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the well-being and stability provided in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (ECSC), the illegality committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the hundreds of tens of people in the 10 million countries lack the opposition for a decade, before yesterday's elections, the opposition, which was formed under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ), seriously hoped that, following the amendment of the Constitution, Lukashenko would allow for a fourth renewal of the presidency's mandate in the controversial elections in 2006.
The ODSZ therefore refrained from the previously considered boy.
Against the backdrop of opposition expectations, Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which has borrowed loans for the reduction of the constantly expensive Russian imports of natural gas and has also contributed to the delivery of Beltransgaz, which has transited the country, to the EU, where Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive an entry permit due to the anti-democratic political arrangement.
He pointed out that, when evaluating the election campaign, the OSCE focused on positive movements rather than on shortcomings, such as the banning of one third of the candidates for opposition.
However, the EESC's fast report on Monday has already opposed the campaign - during which the opposition candidates could not appear in the press in essence - and in particular that the opposition could not be present in the countdown of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, there is a noticeable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to have a minor confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which is breaking away from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus is a federal state on paper - has been deeming the two areas to be independent for a month now.
- We have taken two steps forward, one step back, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - he said to our page, Mr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should be maintained, despite the fact that "power was afraid of allowing up to one opposition in the weightless parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest actions in the light of the results, but rather seeks to send a message to the voters on the need for economic reform.
- We have a lot of problems with this, of course, we need to print the opposition papers in Russia, there are obstacles to distribution by local authorities, but I see that more and more people are supporting change, including among the elderly," said Milinkevich, referring to the Lukashenko regime, which considers the creation of social security as its main result, even among the officially most supported pensioners, is not adequate.
- Due to the country's indebtedness, the increase in the trade deficit, it's a matter of time before the breakdown of social security that refers to the silence of the funeral, Milinkevich thought.
In contrast to the opposition politician, the Russian observers declared the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebegyev, Head of the Mission of the Association of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosztyi: "The people believe not the words but the actions", so the lack of opposition is proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "Morning only before working hours"
In the history of the Chigi Palace, the doors were uniquely installed for the exit and entry of workers.
From today, this new measure will come into force against the skilled, to remove those who block, and then go for a coffee at work.
Today, the anti-pig news was presented by Minister of Administration Renato Brunetta and Secretary General of the Prime Minister's Office Mauro Masi.
"The twistgates," said Brunetta, serve better and more efficient work, reducing the deficits and increasing the number of services."
"There will be a new, more responsible and more transparent period.
This is the real reform," said Brunetta.
The Chigi Palace finishes the installation of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says that "the installation of the screwgates is also symbolically important".
From the staff's side, we did not experience any resistance, the secretary-general confirmed: "The workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated."
In a word, breakfast is over at work, no more coffee and bran.
Brunetta's smiling advice is, "a good cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning, he can do miracles."
At the Roman Administrative College
At a meeting, the Minister explained that "in three months the public sector's public sector deficits decreased by 50 percent, which in one year means that 60 thousand people are more employed".
At the same time, he added that the Italian administration should be made more efficient.
" whose wage dynamic, according to the Minister, has been twice the size of the private sector for the last eight to ten years and has exceeded the inflation rate much."
At the same time, thousands of civil servants gathered, joining the submission supported by the Italian Organisation for the Environment and Consumer Protection in order to protest against the provisions of the Brunetta Regulation.
"While the Minister of Administration is proud of data to support the reduction of the deficits due to the disease, the "untired diaries" war continues to grow," writes the Consumer Protection Association.
Throughout Italy, thousands of honest and hard-working administrative staff gathered together to make war on the illegitimate regulations of the regulation."
The regional administrative court is faced, inter alia, with the abolition of supplementary nutrition for a disease due to service reasons, the extension of the stay of workers on sick leave at home, which means the period during which the patient may appear and several other aspects of the new provisions provided for by the Minister.
Accidents at work: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything else.
Italy has 2.500 accidents at work every day, 3 of which end with death and 27 with permanent disability.
According to the accident insurance at work, nearly 1,200 deaths occurred in the workplace in 2007.
The figures bear witness to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death and requires nearly twice as many victims as human murder.
Today, for the 58th time in every county of Italy, Anmil organises a day of victims of work accidents traditionally held on the second Sunday of October to draw the attention of institutions, social organisations and mass communication to this dramatic problem.
"The worrying data reported by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, also show that prevention plays a prominent role in the accidents at work," said Giorgio Napolitano in his message to President Pietro Mercandelli, president of the National Association of Accidents at Work.
The Head of State sincerely acknowledged the "persevere commitment of the association to prevention at work, the protection of the interests of the workers affected, the assistance of family members of the victims and the capture of public opinion".
"Of course and honestly shared by everyone, this kind of confusion is caused by the tragedy of interest in the media and the public, but in reality we have to face dramatic, repeated and repeated events every day."
Napolitano openly admits: "We are without doubt struggling with a shortage of resources, and funding education and information is crucial.
In-school initiatives aimed at providing direct information to young people at the threshold of access to the labour market are particularly important.
It is our duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to be paid to the social importance of this issue, and to need more effective legislation that needs to be put into effect.
The president of the Lower House, Gianfranco Fini himself, stressed that "the serious social importance of fatal accidents at work, which are a matter of concern to all of us, and the institutions are required to put an end to this as soon as possible".
"The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of such deaths is still incredibly high," said Pietro Mercandelli, President of Anmil.
"We do not, however, want this decreasing trend to be combined with decreasing attention, because it is precisely when the attention is softened that the greatest tragedy occurs."
"We believe that at the general level we are still not doing everything we can to overcome this phenomenon, which could be resolved through a complex action programme.
We believe that more supervision and control is needed - he stressed Mercandelli - and more marked intervention in the field of labour market training, from school education."
He added that further efforts are needed to inform the public and bring them to bear.
What would be most needed, however, is a more responsible employer environment compared to a phenomenon that poses a social problem."
Mercandelli then criticised "the gradual deterioration of the compensation net for victims of accidents at work" and "the aid rate towards which the system is moving in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give back to workers the security provided by the insurance, because the fate of the victims of the accident cannot depend on the lawmakers where they are arbitrary and where the measures taken by the distributor".
MP3 players may cause hearing loss
Can cause permanent hearing loss by listening to portable recording devices for a longer period of time and at high volume, such as MP3 devices -
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the Scientific Committee on New and Newly identified Health Risks (SCENIHR), issued a reference to today's opinion.
"The opinion shows that 5-10 percent of those who spend more than an hour a day listening to their portable music player for more than an hour can suffer permanent hearing loss" – can be read in the explanation.
"It is worrying that young people who use high volume portable music players and mobile phones are not aware that they can cause irreversible damage to their hearing," said Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific surveys indicate an undisputed risk that we must respond urgently", said the EU Commissioner.
The most important task is to inform consumers and disseminate information on this issue widely.
In the light of this opinion, we must also review existing control systems so that they can operate with the necessary efficiency and keep pace with the latest technologies."
Brussels asked the independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people affected by the noise caused by them.
"Researchers confirm that we have cause for concern, and the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine the possible measures to be taken to protect children and young people affected by the noise caused by portable players and similar devices", he said.
The current European safety regulation sets maximum sound levels for portable music players in 100 dB, but growing concern is associated with the data on hearing loss caused by the excessive use of such sources.
At the same time, there are solutions, such as reducing the level and duration of noise pollution, which can significantly reduce these hearing losses.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee explains that for those users who listen to music with high volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week, noise noise exceeds the current maximum workplace noise level.
If a person listens to music under similar circumstances for a longer period of time, there is a risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This affects around 5-10% of the users of portable equipment, which could mean 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemano will set up a committee for the future of the capital
It starts today, it's March, the results are expected in June.
This is the timetable for the operation of the "The future of Rome's capital city" committee, which met this morning in its new seat behind the spas of Caracalla.
In the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commission members will develop Rome's directives.
Following the final speech of March, the study and the plans will be evaluated at the General Assembly and the Municipal Committee in order to be able to submit in June the Helsinki Strategy Plan, which has been formally approved by the Municipality and Mayor of Gianni Alemano.
"This is a fully independent committee in which all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas are represented - and Mr Alemano points out - the task of drawing up proposals for the development of Rome which political decision-makers can rely on, i.e. the General Assembly and the Committee on the Government.
There is no conflict of jurisdiction, we just wanted a platform where great plans for the benefit of Rome can be created.
In March, after his work, the committee will be dissolved because he has a fixed term mandate.
In June, we will present a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee on the Future of the Roman Capital city, the mayor said.
To those who consider the Commission to be unnecessary, referring to the fact that the opinion it has drawn up has no binding force, Alemanno responds: "It all depends on the work it will do and on the quality of the proposals it will put on the table.
If the quality is satisfactory, as in France, as in the case of the Attali Committee, which I am sure will be the case for Rome, the contribution it has made will be important.
The strength of the policy is often spread in day-to-day cases and in cases of urgency from time to time.
On the other hand, we look further away from the perspective and plan longer and are committed to working towards the development and future of Rome".
The mayor of Rome wishes to state that 'this Commission cannot be regarded as a useless 'waterhead', because it is completely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a euro, but it is an incentive to think and aims to involve the best minds of the capital'.
According to Alemanno, "there is a need for an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that allows our city to jump in the standard that it needs so much, thinking in a single spirit about its future".
On the future on which the Mayor of Rome stresses: 'it will not only be limited to the current municipal framework, but will look much further away', we see not only the future metropolis and capital status, but also 'the role that Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean can and must play'.
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
An American politician, known to be independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
It was the first Jimmy Carter to destroy the American economy with his decisions and to maintain close relations (as he does today as a private person) with hostile Islam."
As the date of the election approaches, the attacks on Obama become frequent.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambitions.
Obama thinks that he can gain the highest dignity of a nation with a total of two governors and five senators in black to date!"
These attacks are actually nothing; of course they are racist, but they do not answer the voter’s question whether he will be a good president. Then there are the polls: they indicate that Obama will win, and they will have a significant reputation.
In that case, there is one who listens to his feelings and not to his mind.
Inside the South, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in its lead article: we know well who the real American patriot is voting in the polls.
A side of American thinking appears here that remained hidden until the last moment.
"Just talk what you want, and we'll know where to put the gypsum, Obama or McCain."
Some people swear if Obama wins, they'll leave the United States.
Such words have never been spoken until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all this cleverness, the democratics' winning weapon is George Bush.
1500 people were asked what were the mistakes made during Bush's term of office? 89 percent replied to Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and it was so blown to the bottom that it flew all the way home.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
However, the majority believe that Iraq was a weak point for Bush.
There's a huge task ahead of the man who takes George W.'s place.
U.S.: The economic collapse is felt by journalists, too, the time has come for restrictions in the editorates. Many people blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW Research Institute has asked five hundred American journalists how they feel about the future position and spiritual power of their profession.
Well, right now, almost all journalists are pessimists about their own future.
However, they did not make it clear that their concerns regarding authenticity were reduced.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money.
They believe that the crisis in 2008 is a failure of a powerless economic model.
Another serious problem is the restrictions on newsrooms, which is the newspaper editorates.
If we do not want the traditional journalism, in the sense of what the great public meant by this, to be minimized, this problem must be solved, says the journalists asked.
Today, the American journal is characterised by visible and complex pessimism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior leaders working in the printed press are convinced that national jurisprudence is on the wrong path.
At local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior management positions.
Printed versus electronic press.
Press staff don't find it difficult to see where the world's network is going.
The biggest publishers are on their way to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "murder" of the printed press.
The "economic pressure" perceived by journalists has increased to 79 percent.
The 500 questionable journalists admitted that they would vote for technology in the hope that it might benefit the publicist.
Today, there is a gap in the American press business between the editors, the directors, and the reporters who work for them.
At national level, 56 percent of the leaders are convinced that their reporters share their information with others, while at local level this rate is only 23 percent.
Some people link this to a secure job.
At national level, 47% of drivers fear that they will lose their jobs within three years.
For journalists, this ratio is 30 percent.
In America the question of "secure work" is constantly on the agenda at team level (for our editors, serk.).
Only 13 percent of journalists have contracts.
In the case of a huge nation like the United States of America with 300 million inhabitants, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and Internet service providers work, employers usually recommend as much as they want, so it works on a "need or don't need" basis.
Directors are usually paid high and editors can earn ten thousand dollars a month in addition to pension and health insurance.
Freedom, however, is a rather complex principle: in the first year x days, in the third too, until after a certain period it reaches a maximum of 15 days.
But American journalists, according to their own testimony, often "disease" during the year.
It's all climate function.
UNIPOL: ROMAL COURT: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFRATABAN MARAD
Carmelo Rinaudo, the second member of the Court of Justice of Rome, rejected the application of Danilo Coppola, who wanted to visit a Roman apartment from his place of residence, Grottaferrata.
Coppola is being investigated for economic failure in the context of an investigation into the Unipol - BNL Share Exchange Agreement.
Last week, during the proceedings against him, the house arrest was dissolved and changed to a residence ban for Grottaferrata.
Lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, have requested that the real estate expert be allowed to visit the small rural town to his capital residence.
However, according to the Court of Justice, these influxes (for which the prosecutor has proposed a rejection) would allow the company to influence and have access to evidence brought against it.
The elite in danger
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote for the $700 billion rescue package presented by the White House: a significant part of the Americans were more interested and still interested in the punishment of Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is supported by the New York Times yesterday, which informs us that the current crisis has led to a break in the Republican Party, which is showing an increasing division between the traditional, restrained approach to the east coast in support of federal institutions and business circles and the emerging anti- Washington and financial world trends in the central and southern states.
This trend was critical during the vote in the House of Representatives referred to in the introduction.
However, this event is only one of the major changes that the economic restructuring that is still taking place has foreseen or lets us see, not only in the United States, but also in the whole Western world, and perhaps beyond.
It seems that the crisis, both in the USA and in Europe, is only accelerating the long-standing phenomena that have become stronger in this new atmosphere and are finally brought to light.
The first such phenomenon is the re-exactation, the return of a dual category of state sovereignty to public awareness, a kind of re-nationalisation of the economy.
The crisis affects banking and financial institutions that maintain close links with foreign countries, but primarily, and quite widely, they bring with them people and families who live in a single country, a single state.
This, however, is a direct political problem for those in the government: what to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are electors.
Therefore, the crisis seems to be global in economic terms, but in political terms it is almost exclusively national.
It seems that political internationalism is essentially outside the coastline: it is a glorious proof of this that the European Union is not able to define a single political direction, based on different interests and different national strategies.
So everyone expects the intervention, the rescue package, the recovery and the new rules from each national government, but above all, the opening of funds: because in a situation of need, only the individual states have economic resources, a financial supply that can make things right.
They also have the means and the power to use them: under these circumstances they have two invaluable resources that are likely to have no other market or international organisation to such an extent.
On the other hand, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on nation states is fully in line with the fact that the recent economic growth is a factor that is increasingly relevant to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the abstract world of the network, the increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to rule the world, we had to realise that our future was increasingly dependent on things that were not least abstract, such as water, crops and oil.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to another, but can still be tied to a completely surrounded area, to an area.
So whoever controls the area has a lot more batter cards than the one born of a place where there is no crop, no oil, and no water.
I would also like to go over to the second novelty, which suggests a kind of break line.
Who states that territory, state, government, necessarily says: politics, in other words, leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis appears to have been producing two interlocking phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for credible leadership is for someone who can take over the events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, in particular the economic leaders, is making a total loss of credit, who have proven to be completely incompetent and have proven that many areas are still vague ahead of them.
Together, the two are of even deeper importance and, in a sense, more worrying: the feeling of credit loss, impatientness, inability and separation, which affects the entire leadership elite in more and more Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that the general public is becoming more and more convinced that the time of the social elite at the top of the world has passed. It has expired before their actions, experiences, lifestyles, cultures, in the sense of the word, they would have taken over them, and thus the social elite would increasingly be alienated from the opinion of the majority.
In other words, the need for leadership, in the form of a covering form, is feeding a diverse but strong delegation movement against the ruling division and the traditional political system. This is reflected in the unawaited "convulsions" of voters, or in the recent sudden changes in public opinion. For example, the gain of conservative power in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Unit in Great Britain, or the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right).
It seems that the traditional elite, with its parties, programs, and even with its famous intellectuals, is becoming less and less understood, and therefore less able to represent what has been happening for some time in the deeper parts of Western society. Furthermore, the economic crisis is getting stronger, spreading and potentially disproportionate.
Even so, speaking of "the coming rebellion of the masses" would be an outrage.
But keeping an open eye wouldn't hurt at all.
We can go on the wall with super-strength glue.
A super-strength glue to defeat gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This goal has been set by several American research centres, and a group of four institutions is close to finding a solution.
With only two and a half square inches [2.5 cm] of glue, researchers managed to attach and keep a 100 - pound body to a vertical wall.
The U.S. magazine Tanulmány - Science published the discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the scientific group was derived from the further development of existing, special, so-called carbon nanotubes.
"We must imagine the operating principle of glue as a package of pipe systems similar to spaghetti," says Zhong Lin Wang, researcher of the Atlantic Georgia Institute of Technology.
The researchers drew the idea from the foot of the gecko with microscopic blinds, which gives perfect grip to the animal.
Tests with different materials, such as glass, teflon and sanding paper have confirmed that the new glue is ten times more effective than the feet of the said reptiles, but at the same time "slightly separates from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the engineering department of the University of Dayton.
- "This material can be useful as a temporary glue," adds Liming Dai.
Can we walk on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Perhaps, but researchers prefer to think about a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are well conducting heat and electric currents.
You can find more applications in space research.
The superheroes can wait.
THE OTHER RESEARCH - the University of Berkeley, California, also conducts experiments with a new glue.
According to an article published in the American Chemical Society, California scientists presented a hair -like, microfiber glue that undergoes self - cleansing during movement on the surface, giving perfect grips.
No fruit juice!
Care should be taken with grapefruit, orange and apple.
These high vitamin-containing, especially in the summer, thirsty drinks, when taken together with certain life-saving medicines, change their absorption, increased or reduced as appropriate. This may have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, professor of London University of Western Ontario, announced at a 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, thus preventing their beneficial effects and putting the patient’s health at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already placed on the defendant's bench when it was found that it was able to increase the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiety, heart rhythm control and neuropharmaceuticals to a toxic level.
Risk-AELs - Two years ago, the Italian Medical Institute itself published the news in its official release and warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with such co-administration and to take care of what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange and apple juice also contains substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
A long list of active substances whose absorption is blocked by grapefruit and other fruit juices could be classified.
This is what Michele Carruba, professor of pharmaceuticals at the State University of Milan, points out: "This type of discovery is usually immediately reported to the various national and international pharmaceutical agencies who, if necessary, will make sure that the information contained in the information contained in the product information is changed.
This is why you should always read the information on the medicine you want to take, and if you don't understand it, do not let us influence you, but ask your doctor or pharmacist clearly," said an expert at the Ansa Institute.
Paul Krugman received the economic Nobel Prize
The American Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for the analysis of commercial models and the territorial contexts of economic activity.
The 55-year-old neokeynesian Krugman, at Princeton University, is a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most acute critics of the economic and foreign policy measures of the Bush Government.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in his executive article in the New York Times that the latest event would have even more fatal consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of twin towers.
This forecast has sparked a few debates and has been put in the eye of the economist several times, but we now know that it was accurate.
"I'm surprised, and I'm a little shocked at how quickly the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom has gone beyond public interest," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "very valuable economist", but at the same time "disperses in an aggressive manner the criticisms of the excessive liberalism of the Bush Government."
Open Office, third edition worth the "Antagonist Microsoft" package
The OpenOffice.org 3.0 personal productivity-enhancing, open-source application package, which aims to target more and more layers as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, from free-to-companies to administration.
Following the work carried out by SUN Microsystem and by voluntary developers for almost a year, the new Open Office will take a number of new steps to the public: outside the welcome screen and the redesigned, less-spartan user interface, there are several important innovations. For example, compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system and supports the new ISO standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
Particular attention was paid to the compatibility of Office 2007 so that Open Office can open new extension Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
It is also interesting to have some specific features of the module, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending files by e-mail. Another feature supports the import of PDF files into a graphical module by keeping the site layout.
On the same surface, you can create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format with the table manager or text editor elements.
The distribution within the apps has also undergone a number of improvements: the tabular manager supports the joint use of workbooks, but prevents each other from overwriting. Each employee's comment is marked with different colors, which helps with easier recognizability during the inspection phase.
Some companies are already working to make some features of OpenOffice available on the Internet (on the cloud) so that the final version may be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, which has been available on myrror pages since Friday, can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
The program package is available in addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems for Linux.
At the request of our home or at the workplace, we can take over the installation CD.
In terms of the spread of home application, freedom is probably the biggest attraction, but the Open Office program package is now trying to play ball in the business sector as it can count on a number of administrative and school projects.
There is no lack of education, advisory and service services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business prospects.
The Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, word-compliant text editor; Calc, a table manager to replace Excel; Impress, Powerpoint presentations; Dbase is the most well-known accessible database manager; and finally Draw is the graphical module.
The 2008 target is 5 million downloads. However, if we consider that the new version is already at 3.600,000, this number is likely to be higher than expected.
Kohl's result is positive, this is the fourth doping case.
At the last stage of the Tour de France, one of the participants, the Austrians, who competed in Gerolsteiner, again produced a positive sample, Bernhard Kohl, who also won the best mountain cool trico in addition to the bronze medal.
News has seen the weather on the website of the Equipe Internet.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer, the Italian Riccardo Riccco and Leonardo Piepol, as well as the German Gerolsteiner contestant Stefan Schumacher, who produced a positive result in the Cera test for the third generation EPO.
Kohl's blood sample, as tested in the last few weeks, was tested by laboratories in Launne and Chatenay-Maabry.
If the tests confirm the positive result of Cera, Austria will lose its third position and, according to the rules, prohibit competition for two years.
The news of the positive outcome of Kohl’s third generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, the head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and the Associated Press reported to the Austrian authorities that he had shown positive doping results to the Austrian authorities.
26 - year - old Austrians were able to stand behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and they also won the best spotty trick for mountain cool.
WRITERS: NEW YORK THAN THE WAY TO CALL, OLD RASSIST IN ITALY?
Only recently has Italy become one of the popular destinations of the reluctantly received immigrants from the country of migrants.
That's why the "Belpaese" is turning into a racist nation, and that's what the New York Times raises, starting with the case of Abdul William Guibre, a young Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan last month because he stole a box of biscuits, devotes a long article to the debate about racism in Italy.
The case is well characterised by what the New York Times calls a 'super-paradoxon': in the northern regions, 'the strongest is integration and the highest is employment', while 'the anti-migration and support for the Northern League' is also the strongest in the country.
In order to support the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants, it is also cited in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws required by the League, which would make the lawn closer to immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants, have been set as an example of mood change in Italy.
This trend is also highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano met with Benedict XVI in the Quirinale Palace and raised the need for the State and the Church to cooperate to combat racism".
High rents for students, up to 900 euros could cost a room
The market for accommodation provided to universities is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, Houseowners' Association, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already reached an amazing level, which, due to the massive cost of families, excludes broad student groups from the possibility of learning," explains Laura Marianni, head of the Sunia study office. "In these cities, high demand for students has distorted the market to such an extent that there is also a general process of costing for local residents."
In most cases, real estate offers also include a number of irregularities: non-registered leases with no lease restrictions, with attached leases.
According to Sunia, an exceptional measure would be needed to maximise prices by reviewing the tax system.
Details of the survey show that in Milan, around Brianza, 450 euros are requested for a bed; the price of a single room ranges from 650 euros (Bande Nere area) to 800 euros (Labriate, Udine and Fiera), but can reach 900 euros (Vittoria area).
In Florence, the average cost of a bed is 350/400 euros, a room is about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where most students live near the university, a bed costs 250/280 euros if they are double and 370-500 euros if they are single.
In Rome, around 600 euros are charged for a single and 450 beds in a double room in the vicinity of central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna).
A little cheaper (550 euros per single room) prices in other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save everything in suburbs: 300 euros per bed and 450 single rooms in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar districts.
In Naples, 300/450 euros are charged for a bed, from 400 to 600 euros for a room. Price is the highest in the vicinity of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
Bariban costs EUR 250/350 for a bed and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they represent greater weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students from outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, there is another disorder: the rent charged to foreign students is about 25-30% higher than for Italian tenants.
Goodbye, old Cinema Paradiso.
Traditional cinemas lock you up for the Multiplex.
"A town without movies, blind city, like a face without eyes."
The pictures taken by director Giuseppe Tornatore are an effective demonstration of what takes place in Italian cities, but also in rural areas.
The repression of cinemas - the appearance of the large multi-moded cinemas in the suburbs and the resulting collapse of the single-rooms in the city centres - is an inevitable and irreversible process, but, at the same time, it bears all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
When places filled with history and memories disappear, "it's like a friend of ours going away, an acquaintance with whom we shared our path and many experiences," says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which was an Oscar award twenty years ago and the grand prize of the Cannes festival, tells the story of a small-town cinema in Iria, the yearning for a movie that may have been lost forever.
The largest association of operators, the data reported by Anec, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas were closed. The biggest loss was recorded by cinemas in major cities: 10 cinemas were closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna is one of the most affected regions, which lost 82 single-room cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And that it is the expansion of the multiplexes that is responsible for their disappearance that proves no better than the highest number of newly opened multi-store cinemas in these three regions of Italy: in the last five years, the number of rooms increased by 195 in Lombardia, 81 in Tuscany and the same amount in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally," says Paolo Protti, President of Anec. "It is okay to build new facilities, but the survival of existing ones should also be ensured, because when a city cinema is closed, not all the visitors are willing to go through the multiplexes.
Not to mention the unfilled financial funds intended to support operators: the state’s maturity can be around EUR 10 million.
It is also a disgrace from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
In order to maintain the market, it would take between EUR 16 and 18 million a year".
This is the first Italian city to decide, in its concern over the closures, to remedy the problem by means of an agreement between the municipality and Anec, in order to protect and boost one-stop shop in the outskirts and downtown.
The provisions would include tax incentives for operators and benefits for the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers can access restricted zones and park in certain parking spaces with a reduced tariff.
'You like this initiative,' says Giuseppe Tornatore, 'and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example, even by introducing other measures.
But it is also certain that traditional cinemas will need to improve sound and image quality, because today’s audience is much more demanding.
Protecting the traditional cinema was always an important question for me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and youth life, gave me the spark that made me do Cinema Paradiso after all, although I've been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to Via Nazionale in front of the closed Rialto or Quirinale so I don't see dust-black posters, I'd rather turn my head away.
Close links between politics and the 'ndranghet, arrested Mayor of Gioia Tauro
"Gioia Tauro's mayor supported the interests of the Piromodel clan in municipal decisions."
The judges of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria have made serious accusations against the mayor and vice-president of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning for his external involvement in the crime syndicate.
The chain was placed under the hands of Gioacchino Piromodel, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration and a nephew named after the boss, who had previously been convicted of participating in a mafia crime-like association and was reimbursed EUR 10 million.
"The lack of any legal and moral rule, which is more than good taste," says the state prosecutors. The two local authorities declared their intention to pay a consultant fee to Piromodel's lawyer.
"This way the clan would have had an official access to the city hall, which would have given further opportunity to control and manage the administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, President of the General Assembly of the region of Calabria, does not hide that there is "a large number of cooperation between local institutions and organised underworlds in the region": There are areas where the spread of the Mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where it is almost inevitable.
However, many local politicians are resisting the pressure of 'ndranghete', they are the heroes who remain clean.
The arrests this morning are the continuations of the events in July, when the police have announced that they have managed to decapitate the Piromodel clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were exempted from their municipal administration mandate.Gioia Tauro's municipal committee was dissolved once in 1991, even because of alleged mergers between organised crime and local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, a Christian Democrat mayor at the time of the break-up, was the leader of the right centre coalition in the second round of 2006.
She cried out when the County House ordered the disbanding of the municipal commission.
He brought Deputy Minister of Interior Marco Minini to justice and accused him of planning everything for political purposes. However, in the arrest warrant signed this morning, the court stated that the Piromodel clan had the courage to demand a change in project A3.
The interrogation against Dal Torrione shows, states the state prosecutors, that "it was willing to meet the demands of a large company known to be close to the Piromodel family, to subordinate the decisions of the government to the clan interests."
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come.
An inexhaustible energy source that accounts for 70% of the planet's surface, which is only now being discovered by large international energy companies.
Waves, sea currents, tides, all renewable energy sources, for which giants like Chevron are now trying to put their hands on it.
For hundreds of years, they have been searching for ways to gain energy from the movements of the sea. In the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research increased.
Around 1980, when oil prices decreased, the idea of using marine energy was discarded, but today the recovery of environmental demands and oil prices gives the industry new impetus.
According to the World Energy Council (WEC) of London in 2007, 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by marine wave recovery facilities.
This quantity is twice what nuclear power plants are currently producing.
In addition, the currents and the tide would be there.
The giants are on the ground.
Enersis was the first company to commit itself to marine energy and to sign an agreement in 2005 on a power plant in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary move when the signature was announced.
Two years have passed since then, and more and more companies are voting for marine energy, including those who have been committed to traditional energy so far.
"Chevron is researching ocean energy technologies and considering the possibility of cooperation with us," stated one of the associated companies of the American oil industry giant, Wall Street Journal.
The cooperation in question concerns the acquisition of an authorisation for the launch of a project in Alaska for the exploitation of marine energy issued by the US Energy Committee.
This is not a minor matter, especially in view of the fact that the US is in the process of oil extraction in Alaska, and even President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
Besides Chevron, Verdant Power Inc., New York and Ocean Power, New Jersey, are also on the road to energy from the sea. The amounts invested so far, as far as you can see, are evidence of increasing interest.
Technology is waiting for development.
According to the experts, it is still an initial technology, only because the energy from the sea does not dispel the doubts about the environmental impact.
Existing facilities such as Portugal or Scotland are all small and therefore do not cause too much problems with the ecosystem.
However, in order to produce more energy on a larger scale, it is necessary to have facilities that have a more significant environmental impact.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a connected boja system.
The shocks generated by the waves and moving the bushes up and down are turned into hydraulic pressure by the plungers and cylinders placed in them.
The pressure is turning a turbine, which feeds a generator.
The electric current goes to land on cable underground.
There are currently four similar types of facilities in the planning phase, which are only waiting for a federal permit. Some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started producing energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six sub-marine turbines located in the East River in New York.
When the water is running, the motion of the turbines rotates the shovels, and this rotation feeds the generator.
Verdant said that he had a long list of partners waiting only for permission to use energy.
Waves after tides.
At present, special attention is needed to make use of the opportunities available through the flood.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and therefore can be considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states spent $7.5 million in 2008, precisely to exploit the energy supplied by the tide, which is expected to grow to $35 million in 2009.
