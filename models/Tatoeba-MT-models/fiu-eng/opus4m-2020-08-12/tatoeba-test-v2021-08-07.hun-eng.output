I remember Tom wearing a brown hat.
I reminded him of his duty.
I respect Tomi.
I'll retire in four years.
I put my ass at risk for you.
First iron these shirts.
I'll run faster than you.
I run eight kilometers a day.
I'm running.
I won the horses, sir.
That's what I said, but I didn't mean it.
I told you this wouldn't work!
I said no.
Thank you.
I sat and looked.
I sat next to him.
I sat down to think.
I sat down to think.
I was sitting next to the driver.
Tomato fruit or vegetables?
I was sitting on the floor.
I saw a bear drive a truck.
I saw a bear take a truck.
I saw a very good movie last weekend.

I secretly photographed him.
I see a house.
I see a lion.
I see a nobleman and a noble woman.
I rarely see him.
I see this.
I see what you mean.
I smelled danger.
I sent you flowers.
I served with Tom at the Special Forces.
I set the table for six people.
I set it up for six.
Is everybody okay?
Is everyone here?
“ Is everyone talking about me? ” No, Tomi, you're not that important.
Everything's fine in the office.
Is everything ready?
Is fast food really unhealthful?
Is French harder than English?
Is the French pronunciation difficult?
Do you teach French at your school?
Your language is French?
Is it a crime to hack YouTube?
Is he sick or a doctor?
American?
Cry?
Is he my friend?
Is he tall?
I shake my hand with Tom, and I'm gone.
I shook my head.
I should go there.
I should have asked Tom first.
I should have asked Tom for help.
I should have been a movie star.
I should have been at the meeting.
I should have been at the meeting.
I should've been more focused.
I should have been much more precise.
I should have been more thorough.
I should have been there sooner.
I should have brought more food.
I should've come here first.
I should have done that last week.
I should've done this somewhere else.
I should have done that with you.
I should have helped Tom do that.
I should never have come to Boston.
I shouldn't have said anything.
I should have refused to do that.
I should have seen this coming.
I should have stayed out of it.
I should have tried something else.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I should have expected that.
I should have followed your advice.
I should have said I wasn't busy.
I scream, but no one can hear me.
I just want to know what this is about.
Is that a bird?
Is it okay if I call you Tom?
Is this a wolf?
Is it cold in Germany?
Is this dangerous?
Easy to learn to speak Esperanto?
It's fatal?
Is it gonna rain tomorrow?
Is it hard to speak English?
Is that mandatory?
Is that normal?
Do you mind if I sit down here?
A ekik?
Is it too late?
Is it true Tom committed suicide?
Is it true Tom killed himself?
Is it true you learned Esperanto in a week?
Is it true that you made Tomi's daughter's request?
Is it true you like salty coffee?
Time's wide?
Fruit juice is more affordable than coffee?
I'm skiing in the winter, swimming in the summer.
Laurie Dundi?
I sleep with two pillows.
I fell asleep an hour after midnight last night.
I fell asleep, I was late for school.
I slept for nine hours.
I was thanking my boss.
I cut up the turkey.
Mary Tom's mother?
I smoke cigarettes.
Is Monday gonna be okay?
Is that clear?
I clicked on a picture.
I snuck into the house.
I ran into the house.
I sneezed.
Is that okay with you?
Wasn't it enough for you to ruin my life?
Isn't it a stomach-snake?
I sold it this afternoon.
Sometimes I'm sad.
Sometimes my stomach hurts.
I sleep sometimes.
Is it far from Paris?
I speak a little Dutch.
I speak a little Hungarian.
I speak a little Hungarian.
I speak a little Hungarian.
I'll speak a little Russian.
I speak a little Russian.
I speak a little Russian.

I speak Spanish.
I've been with him all day.
I've been with them all day.
I spent all my money.
I spent all my money.
I spent all the money I had to buy the book.
I wandered for an hour until I found out where to go.
I spent my life in an incubator.
I spent my life in an incubator.
I spent the afternoon with my friends.
I spent the whole day in front of my computer.
I spent three years for a crime I didn't commit.
I've been sitting for three years for something I haven't done.
I told you too soon.
They're putting lemonade on my bread.
Is it raining?
Russia is part of Europe or Asia?
Is he that important?
Is she your mom?
Are you very close to Sicily Malta?
I've been staring at papers all day and now I'm tired.
I began to doubt the truth of his claim.
I stayed.
Tea is more expensive than milk?
Is it allowed?
Is that all your change?
A secret?
Is that right?
Is that deliberate?
Is that fly in the picture or is it photographed there?
Is that fly in the picture or on it?
Is this my cup?
Did they put this in a document?
Is that a problem for you?
Is that real money?
Do you have a scientific basis for this?
Did you expect something like that?
Is that so hard to understand?
Is that the problem?
Right?
But is that true?
Is that what everyone wants?
Is the cat on or under the chair?
Is the beach clear?
Is the race this bad?
Is the microphone on?
Is the museum open today?
Is there a doctor on board?
Is there a free space?

Is that so hard to understand?
Is that the key you're looking for?
Is that valuable?
Is this love for home to you?
Is that what you call love home?
Is she your girlfriend?
Is this your money?
I still don't remember anything.
I still can't tell you why.
It was seven or eight years ago, exactly where were you?
I still don't understand anything.
I still don't know why you did it.
I still have a lot of time to have fun.
There's one or two things left to put in the suitcase.
I still have to have breakfast.
I still think this is the best choice.
Tom is a Christian?
Is Tom good at cooking?
Tom's a good cook?
Tom's a good teacher?

— Tom is American? — No, Canadian.
Tomi's coming over this afternoon?
Tom's dead?
Is Tom in?
Tamás left-handed?
Tom's lost?
Tom Mary's son?
Is Tom ready?
Tamas is still sick?
I stood by him.
I stopped by today, but you weren't home.
I stopped to talk.
I study about two hours a day.
I study hard at school.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I guess you're packed and ready to go.
I'm sure I've heard that sound somewhere.
I swear I'll make it up to you.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half miles a day.
Is your daughter feeling better?
Are you doing dangerous work?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom home?
No doubt about it.
It affects everyone.
It's not over until we're over it.
I'll take his place.
I go on a train every day.
I talked to Tom a couple of times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
She might be better off with your sister.
It comes with the love I feel for you.
It cost me a lot more than I expected.
The price is two euros.
It could be a problem.
It must be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all that work wasted.
Obviously, I'm upset.
It didn't break.
I wasn't sick.
That didn't help much.
The snow didn't stop.
There's no snow left.
She'll let you come cold.
He's not doing anything!
It doesn't matter who started it and why.
It doesn't seem that complicated anymore.
That doesn't look right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like they poured it on me.
I slowly realized I misunderstood him.
The last day was snowing.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your trust in me.
It happened at the beginning of last week.
That's exactly what happened on the day of our marriage, dear.
There had to be a reason for this.
It happened all of a sudden.
That was when he was outside.
It happened to me several times.
Sometimes it happens.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
I've got my own value.
It's raining since Tuesday.
I think every fat man should have a diet.
I think everyone's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I find your novel boring.
I think there's a couple of movie cubes out there.
I think I can do it.
I don't think I'd be able to kill.
I don't think I could kill you.
I don't think I understand you.
I feel better.
I think I got the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm losing my head.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
It's like I saw a rat.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's right.
It's a very small probability, in my opinion, that you're going to be able to do that by yourself.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think that's unfair.
I think it's true.
I think it was Tom who helped Mari.
I think you'd better leave now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor might have died.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I think there's someone at the door.
I think something's wrong.
I find spiders cute.
I think he's at home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget about that.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I'm thinking, so I exist.
I don't think there's any point in trying to convince him.
I think they did a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom's already been there.
I think Tomi's agitating.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Tamás wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom's gonna be able to help.
I think Tamás wins.
I think we can handle it.
I think we should be patient.
I think we're going the wrong way somewhere.
I think we need to be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I'm guessing you're all out of line right now.
I think you called the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know the name of Tamás's girlfriend.
I think you're gonna approve.
I think you look great.
I guess you'd like it.
I think you misunderstood.
I think you should go in personally.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think you're doing a really good job.
I think you smell nice.
I don't think you've been convincing enough.
I think you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I thought if we went somewhere to eat, it'd cheer me up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with her.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head was going to explode.
I've been thinking about my future.
I thought putting the key under the towel was a good idea, but it didn't prove that.
I thought Tomi was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom might be coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened to kill the neighbor.
That hurts!
That hurts.
I'm under her influence.
I've been very impressed.
It's an accident!
It's a historical play.
It's hard to put into practice what we were talking about.
It's hard for everyone to please.
It's hard to please everyone.
I have doubts as to whether it will work.
It's getting very late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's high time you started a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
It's basically your fault.
He's in the kitchen.
It's wonderful.
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We need to prepare for the future.
You need a good rest.
It's never too late to learn.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke detector cannot be switched off.
This isn't the best way.
It's not the right thing to do.
It's not too much to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom's having a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It's not right to talk with a mouth full of mouth.
It's snowing.
He's still moving.
Wow, it's a bad time today.
It's so expensive.
It's 30 meters long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him.
It's up to you.
That's useful information.
It's hot at night.
It's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly after you change the baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It's gonna be dangerous.
It'll be dark by the time we get home.
It'll be ready by then.
It'll be ready by the time you need it.
It'll take some time to get used to wearing glasses.
He'll be gone soon.
It'll work if I change the polarities.
As a result, it looks bigger.
It looks good.
You don't seem to need me here.
You could use a shave.
Looks like you're not feeling very well here.
You seem to have thought of everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what matters.
This could be a long time.
It might be a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd enjoy it if we tried.
I might be late.
You have to wash it.
You have to report something.
It must have been love.
They must have stolen it.
We need to fix it.
Never existed.
It never should have happened.
Even though I lied to him, I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tomi not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you, I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tomi.
I have a question for you, too.
I took a bath for a long time.
I've been in the tub for a long time.
I've arranged it.
I went on route 58.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the animal hospital yesterday.
I took my shoes off.
I totally forgot.
It's probably cheaper somewhere else.
The rain broke yesterday morning.
It fell yesterday.
It's raining a lot.
I work out two hours a day.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I traveled across the United States.
Actually, it works.
It's really sad.
I tried everything to keep him alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tomi.
I'd trust my life.
I'm trying to keep you informed.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice flag.
Big-ass cat.
It's a little early for drinking, isn't it?
It's a boring word.
It's a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, at least on paper.
A gray stone building.
It's a housekeeper.
It's half an hour till lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's dark outside.
It's all mine.
It's all right, it's over.
It's nice and good in theory, but will this work in practice?
It's all your fault.
It's 7 o'clock now.
It's already in progress.
It's 10:00 a.m.
One of my dreams was always living next to a stream.
It's always the same note.
It's an environmental disaster.
It's a dirty business, Watson, an ugly, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
What a shame!
Too bad I'm late.
Too bad Tomi's leaving.
It's a pretty big weirdo.
That's a rumor.
It's freezing.
It's just as much art as science.
That's in the past.
He's in school.
It's a very dangerous sport, where a slight mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
It's a waste of money.
That's a weird question.
That's terrible.
It was a crazy week.
It was a long day.
It was an amazing journey.
This day is exhausting.
It's a tough day.
This has happened before.
It wasn't just any week.
It's been two years since he left me.
That's better.
It's better to water the garden at night.
It's hot.
Oh, my God.
It's cheaper to get on a bus.
It's Chinese for me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed every Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold in here.
It's cold.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you get yourself a sweater?
It's commonly known that the bear loves honey.
It doesn't matter if Tom did it or not.
It's perfectly normal.
All right now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep in here.
It's delicious.
It's done!
It's no easier to start than to stop.
It's very easy to be brave.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
Looks like the bus was late.
That sounds ridiculous.
Looks like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Looks like nothing's changed.
It looks really weird.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's in no hurry.
It's like you don't want this to work for me.
Looks to me like you're being honest.
It seems to me you're wrong.
Looks like we're having an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Dear.
It's fair to have the same salary for the same job.
It's not nearly perfect.
It's far from the ideal.
This is for you.
You know, that's funny.
It's starting to freak out.
It's getting serious.
We're gonna have a tough time.
It won't be easy.
Good luck seeing the stars.
It's good to be gay.
It's good for learning.
I'm so glad you could make it.
I'm sure you'll laugh.
It's hard not to come to that conclusion.
It's hard to believe it's been clear and sunny all this time.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a bench in this town where you can sleep.
It's hard to put it into words.
It's hard to express words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
It's smugly nice.
He's got a disproportionate head.
High.
The kids already have a place in bed.
Stop throwing money!
It's warmer than usual tonight.
That's illegal.
It's important.
It is important that parents are on the same page when it comes to raising children.
It's important to help those in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to meet your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your terms.
I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring.
Unbelievable, you know?
It's inevitable.
It's inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
It's just a step away.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
I just don't want to die today.
It's kind of hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
It's nice of you to say that.
It's late.
It's laundry today.
It's like an underwater field and turtles, crabs and sharks above it like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's pathetic how you live.
It's too cold to swim.
That's my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
It's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
It's not as sharp as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
That's not gonna happen.
It's not Mennad's job to change Egypt.
This isn't mine.
It's not my fault.
It's not negociable.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not about what you're doing, it's about how you're doing it.
It's not worth complaining about.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I didn't tell you.
There's no point in confessing to the priest if you don't repent.
There's no point in being sad about the past.
It's snowing.
Obviously, it's broken.
Clearly impossible.
It's obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It's okay if some people think I'm a peasant.
It's okay if you're gay.
“ It’s been three months, and Tomi’s already saying that she talks liquidly about France. ” Well, she’s at the top of the stupid ass. “ What’s the peak? ” Dunning-Kruger effect.
Only three days.
It's on the other side of the park.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It looks like I'm pouring it out of the jam.
He opened his wings.
It's pretty amazing.
Pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these mizanthropic theories is to express itself in the appreciation of the working class, exempting imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars it excites, and to believe that endless wars are the cause of man’s inborn aggressive tendencies.
Very urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
It's really a big number.
That's where it is.
It's rude to ask someone how much you make.
They say the Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they're about to leave Tokyo.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston.
It's so good to stay home.
He's still moving.
It's suicide.
That's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
That's the least I can do.
It's theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
We still have to answer that.
It's time to pick up our tent tree.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I should have cut my hair by now.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's high time we did something about this.
It's Tom's birthday today.
It's Tom's decision.
Tomi's word is against Mari's word.
It's too dark to play ball.
That's expensive to me.
It's too hot for that now.
Too late.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's a typical fall time.
The cold sucks.
It's ugly, shocking yellow, and it doesn't have anything to do with anything, but at least they don't run away in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think he is.
It's unlikely that anything serious will happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you whether we're going there or not.
Very attractive.
It's very boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very disturbing.
Very amusing.
It takes a lot to live here.
That's very kind of you.
It's very white.
It's warm.
That's what we agreed on.
This is your only chance.
A thorough learning of a language requires about 10,000 hours of learning.
You have to be brave about success.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
It took me nearly three years to build my house.
He's got everyone out of the blue.
It took me an hour.
It took me a lot of time to write this book.
It took me over a month to recover from the cold.
It took Tom a long time to pick a pair of shoes.
It took me a long time to find him.
I turned to a little alley.
I did.
I'm going left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was fun.
It was a dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a silly question.
That was a stupid idea.
It was a tragic accident.
It was really great food.
It was a waste of time for all of us.
It was so weird.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
It was a disaster.
It was obviously very enjoyable.
We had a good time yesterday.
It was hard at first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, and the weather was wet.
It was just a trip.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost dark.
This was not long before John had an idea. John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
It wasn't a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It wasn't easy to keep my promise.
That was a blow under the belt.
