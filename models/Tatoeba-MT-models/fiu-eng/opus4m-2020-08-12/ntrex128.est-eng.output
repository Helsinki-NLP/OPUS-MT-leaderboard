Members of the Wales National Assembly fear that they look like the Muppets.
Some of the members of the National Assembly are amazed at the recommendation to turn their title into MWP.
The theme has begun with the plan to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this can lead to ridicule.
One member of the National Assembly of Laborists said that his groupmates are concerned, as it is glaring with the words Twp and Pwp.
For an explanation to readers outside of Wales: the word daft means pwp means rooster and pwp means rooster.
The member of the board said that the whole group is “not happy” and has proposed other names.
A member of the Wales Conservative Party said that his group would take the name change “attractive” but noted that the word “MWP” is very similar to “Muppet”.
To explain: the word "w" is similar to the word "u" in the English language of Yorkshire.
The Committee of the National Assembly, which is currently drafting a draft law on change of name, said: "The final decision on all the names by which the members of the National Assembly are invited, of course, will be taken by the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the National Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public questionnaire on proposals for names, which widely supports the idea of re-electing the National Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the appointment of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the name ‘WMPs’, but the participants in the public interview were most in favour of the ‘MWP’ option.
Members of the Assembly are likely to propose other names, but reaching an agreement may be a challenge for President Elin Jones, who should present a draft law on amendments in the coming weeks.
The reform act also includes other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules on the withdrawal of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on the appointment of the members of the National Assembly shall be left to the members during the debate on the act.
The Macedonians are holding a referendum on changing the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday whether to re-name their country as the "Republic of North Macedonia".
A referendum will be held to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its province of Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents a requirement for this territory and has repeatedly objected to the application of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, has said that he intends to ignore the vote against the name change.
However, referendum advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, claim that the change in name is only the price the country would pay for its accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent, because the churches of Harlem are in trouble.
“The older people I've been talking to have said there was once a bar and a church on every corner,” said Mr Adams.
"It's not either of them anymore."
He said that the loss of bars is understandable.
“People communicate differently today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer neighbourhood living rooms, where people stay every day.”
However, as far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders hope, and “they will be back at the beginning sooner or later”.
Adams added that churches can be replaced by flats full of people who do not provide help to the remaining churches of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he added, “who therefore accelerates the arrival of the day when all these churches close their doors because it is unlikely that most of the people living here will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin’s Church ten years later.
The original congregation of white Methodists left in the 1930 ’ s.
The black congregation, which had so far worshiped God in the vicinity, took over the property rights of the building.
At the head of the Afro-American congregation in the St. Martin's Church was led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott against the 125th Street shopkeepers on Harlem's main shopping street when they refused to hire or promote blacks.
In the 1939 fire, the building was severely damaged, but when the members of Father Johnson’s congregation planned the restoration of the building, they introduced a livestock or clock game.
Father Johnson's son and heir at St. Martin's Church, Reverend David Johnson proudly called the flock "the watches of poor people".
However, the expert who played the orchestra in July gave it a second name: “cultural value” and “unreplaceable historical instrument”.
The expert at Tiffany Ng Michigan University also noted that it was the first flock in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued 18 years ago to play a larger livestock in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said that the Church of St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been played in St. Martin’s Church in recent months has been a story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been accompanied by secular leaders of the church, others by the bishophood.
In July, the congregation governing body of the church’s presidency, or secular leaders, complained to the bishop in writing that the bishop’s “trying to pass on the costs,” although the church was not even involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some members complained about poor transparency in the bishopship’s actions.
In California, a shark injured a 13-year-old lobster boy.
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who dived into California on the opening day of the lobster season after lobsters.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB TV that he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries for help and then swam over there to help the boy get out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought that the boy expressed his enthusiasm for having a lobster, but “it became clear that the boy was screaming, ”“ I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
His entire tibia had been torn bare," Hammel described the sight he saw when he arrived at the boy.
“I called on everyone to come out of the water, “The water is a shark!”” added Hammel.
In life-threatening condition, the boy was taken on a plane to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The species of the shark that has been attacked has not yet been known.
The rescuer and Captain Larry Giles said at the press conference that sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but then it was established that this was not a dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were located at the top of the hull.
For research and safety purposes, the authorities closed access to Ponto Beach, Ecinitas, from Casablanca to Swami, for 48 hours.
Giles added that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take over the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's will take over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains, creating supermarket-like breaks for beauty products, where expert advisors also work.
As part of the significant penetration of the UK market of GBP 2.7 billion, which, as fashion and home goods sales continue to decrease, is on the rise, a wider series of beauty products will be tested in 11 shops across the country, and will be introduced in other shops next year if successful.
The investment in beauty products is due to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to make use of the previously allocated shelf space for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's stated that it intends to double its range of beauty products up to 3000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
Existing product options from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in branded areas such as those currently found in Boots' stores.
The supermarket will also re-market its brand of make-up products in Boutique, where most products are suitable for vegans, as young buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop, a perfume retailer, is testing exclusive sales licenses in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will be opened this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping on the web and the transition to buying small quantities of food on a daily basis from local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to try harder to convince people to visit them.
The CEO of Sainsbury, Mike Coupe, has said that the outlets will increasingly be similar to supermarkets, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight cheap chains such as Aldi and Lidl, providing more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury's has put Argos' sales places in hundreds of shops. The same has been done with Habitats's sales sites, since both chains were purchased in Sainsbury two years ago, which allegedly supported the sale of food products and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The earlier attempt by the supermarket to upgrade its beauty and treatment departments ended with failure.
Sainsbury tested the joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended with a dispute about how to share the proceeds from the sale of pharmaceutical products in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold 281 of its sons to Celesio three years ago, with the entire Lloyds Pharmacy chain of commerce.
The strategy also plays its role in Lloyds, adding luxury skin care products to its range of four shops, including from brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the business manager of Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the appearance and nature of our snacks for beauty products in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also spent money on special training workers who are always ready to advise.
Our brand selection corresponds to every need. However, the attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a competitive destination for the beauty trade, which can change old shopping methods."
Peter Jones is mad because Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million pounds of business.
Dragons Den's star Peter Jones left the “grabbing” when TV director Holly Willoughby gave up a 11 million-pound deal in his lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughbyl's running out of time for Truly's brand of household goods and clothing.
A couple of business is compared with the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop.
The 37-year-old TV director of this Morning announced his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons Den star into Peter Jones' anger by stepping out of their luxurious lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on his new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said that Jones was “grabbly” when the TV stargirl admitted at an intense meeting held at Marlows Buckinghamshire on Tuesday at the husband’s business empire headquarters that her new contracts worth £1.5 million would mean that she would no longer have time to commit herself to the brand of household clothing and clothing, Truly.
The business has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand, Goop, and it was thought to double Willoughby's estimated assets of GBP 11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left for a holiday home in Britain.
One source said: “Truly was certainly Holly’s main priority.
It was supposed to secure her more distant future, so she thought she was doing it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everything related to the matter in complete amazement.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because it was so close to placing the product series on the market.
There's a warehouse in Marlow's headquarters full of ready-to-sale goods."
Experts believe that leaving the TV show “This Morning”, one of Britain’s highest-paid celebrities, can cost the company millions of dollars, because products with a choice from couch cushions and candles to clothing and household clothing have invested a very hard amount of money, and this can also lead to the later placing on the market of the product.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016. 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as president in March.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's teleproduction company.
Willoughby becomes an M&S brander and replaces Ant McPartlin with ITV TV series "I'm A Celebrity".
One of Jones' close sources said last night: "I don't want to comment on his business."
Hard talk, "after what we fell in love"
Trump was joking about the criticism that was directed to him in the news for a comment that some consider to be "undeservable to the President" and for excessive positivity towards the North Korean Head of State.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with his grim "new anchor voice":
"I haven't given up on anything."
He noted that after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the abandonment of North Korea's nuclear weapons, he was interested in a second meeting.
However, the negotiations on the abandonment of nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea would not see the USA as a "corresponding response" to North Korea's initial decommissioning steps.
Selmet noted that the US would continue to impose pressure on the country in the future.
The perspective of the Trump cheering speech was much more lively.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“A war was about to begin with North Korea.
Millions of people would be dead.
It's all right between us now."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced good results: the missile experiments have been completed, the hostages have been helped to release and the remains of American servants are being brought home.
He also defended his unusual communication with Kim.
“It is very easy to be president, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait outside to get to this full-blown stadium, it is better if we have nearly 200 people here,” said Trump, referring to the crowd before him.
The tsunami and the earthquake will destroy the Indonesian island, killing hundreds of people.
In the resolution of the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population had to be relocated, a national disaster, which is a prerequisite for international assistance, was not declared.
“They have often expressed very clearly that they do not want international assistance, so the stories are a little complicated,” said Mrs Sumbing.
While the organisation Save the Children is putting together a team to go to Põus, it is not yet clear whether foreigners can work in the region.
Mr Sutopo, the press representative of the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation in Papus in order to decide whether international authorities would be allowed to contribute to the assistance.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is surprisingly little prepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although shelters for tsunami have been built in Aceh, they are not very common in other coastal areas.
Although the tsunami was warned, the obvious lack of a tsunami alert increased the number of victims likely to have died.
Traveling between many islands of Indonesia is also quite challenging in the best times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which stopped in Lombard to treat the victims of the earthquake, is heading to Pula, but it takes at least three days to reach a new location.
President Joko Widodo has turned Indonesia's fragmented infrastructure into a central part of his election campaign and has distributed money on roads and railways.
The budget deficits, however, threaten Mr Joko's government, as the new elections will take place next year.
Mr Jokot is also under pressure from the tensions in Indonesia among those who are kind, where members of the majority Muslim community have turned to an older form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands left their homes because of the fights between the Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets, where machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons were used.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge hits the pingate in the game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing Chelsea at the Premier League, wringing the position at the 89th game in Stamford Bridge, London on Saturday.
Sturridge was fed by Xherdan Shaqir, about 27 meters from Chelsea Gate, when his team led 1 :0.
He hit the ball left before he hit it in the direction of a remote post.
The ball flew high above the penalty area and hit the upper right corner of the net.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get this position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq give the ball as much as possible, so I just tried to win as much time as possible for myself,” said Sturridge on LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I took one touch, and I gave him a long shot without thinking."
At the end of the first half, Chelsea 1 : 0 led by the 25th game minutes to the gates of the Belgian star Eden Kärd.
The Blues attacker fed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic before he turned around in the middle field and hit Liverpool half.
Kovacic gave us a quick feed in the middle field.
Then he created a beautiful air feed, leading him to the arrest zone.
The Hand got through the defense and set the ball on the left of Liverpool’s player, Alisson Becker, on a remote post into the net.
Liverpool will play with Naples in the Masters League sub-group on Wednesday at 15.00 Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea is facing Videoton in the UEFA Euro League game on Thursday at 15.00 in London.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, said the State Disaster Agency on Sunday morning.
A number of people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed due to the 7.5-magnetous earthquake that led to the 18-metre giant waves on Friday, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at the press conference.
With over 380 000 inhabitants, the town of Põu was buried under collapsing buildings.
The police will arrest a 32-year-old man with a murder suspect after he's stabbed his wife to death.
The murder investigation started this morning after finding a woman's body in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 07:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street. A 32-year-old man has been arrested for murder.
The police call to contact people who have moved in the area who may have seen or heard something.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is just beginning, but I would ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us and heard or saw something suspicious.
I would also ask all taxi drivers, especially those whose on-board cameras might have recorded, to contact us, as they may have information essential to our investigation."
The police spokesperson confirmed that the woman found in a building was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, a woman’s alleged friends came to the scene asking questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way, and the police have said they're informing their close relatives at the moment.
The cab driver in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but the police told him no one could enter or leave the house.
The man was struck when he heard about the incident.
The residents were told that it might take hours to get back into the house.
A police officer told a man that the whole area was now considered a crime scene.
There was a woman in tears at the scene.
He kept saying, "It's terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police buses were still in a closed area, and the third was right there.
A number of police officers stood in this area and watched the apartment building.
Anyone with information about the event will be asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 using the keyword 30 September log 247.
The shape of Parliament's Cromwell is the last memorial, which is the cause of the "history rewrite" dispute.
Eliminating this would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious objects in the Taliban style by the man's inhuman followers.
But Cromwell's association described Mr. Crick's recommendation as an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, Chairman of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of images, it was impossible to remain intact in front of Oliver Cromwell’s Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not rob the pictures himself in the English Civil War, nor did he tell others to do so.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell man's ancestor Thomase was sacrificed for what he did last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent presentation of Cromwell is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the historical record of the person who, in the opinion of many people, should still be respected."
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “A lot of people thought at the end of 19 rather than today that Cromwell's parliament was a defender of external pressure and, of course, of the king's power.
Whether this is an accurate reflection is an endless historical dispute.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our people, and Cromwell clearly represents this gap on one side.
His achievements as Lord Defender also deserve celebration and commemoration."
A Chinese farmer was killed by a killer.
According to local media reports, the farmer who killed the man was attacked on the market in South-East China by a pig.
A man identified with the name Yuan only was found dead and covered with blood near the Sage on the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, reported the Morning Post newspaper of South China on Sunday.
Preparation of pigs in the province of Qinghai, Xinging, China, on 30 May 2005 for vaccination of pigs.
He and his cousin had allegedly come from Yunnan, neighboring province, on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, the husband’s cousin found him dead and discovered that the abyss was open.
He said there was a big, bloody mouth-to-mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that a 249,47 kg of anoric had been reported to have killed a farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were all bloody and bruised,” said cousin Wu, the victim’s cousin “Guiyang Evening News”.
Security footage showed that Yuan entered the market on Thursday morning at 04:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found almost an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he couldn't attack anyone else until the police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market leaders are allegedly discussing the payment of compensation for the death of a man.
Although rarely, it has also been observed earlier that pigs attack humans.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband in their Massachusetts farm. The man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, 294.8 pounds [294.8 kg] of pig nailed a farmer in Wales to his tractor, while the husband’s wife scared the animal away.
When one of Oregon’s farmers ate his own pigs in 2012, one of Manitoba’s farmers told CBC News that the pigs would not normally attack, but because of the taste of blood, they could be destroyed.
“They’re just playful.
They are very curious maracrats who are not meant to be injured.
They just have to be respected enough," said the man.
Hurricane Rosa's afterwinds bring extensive rainfall in the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken, moving across the north coast of Mexico towards cooler waters.
However, in the coming days Rosa will bring rainstorms to North Mexico and the Southwest of the United States.
On Sunday morning at 05:00 on the east coast, Rosa was classified with winds of 136,78 km per hour as a first - category hurricane, heading 619,59 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low-pressure system is beginning to develop over the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it starts to direct deep tropical moisture towards the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will arrive in Mexico, where it will rain down to an inch [25.4 cm] of rain.
The tropical humidity that reacts to the approaching low pressure in the south-western part of the country will then generate extensive strong rainfalls in the coming days.
At times, the rain that fell from two and a half inches [2.54 to 10.16 cm] causes dangerous sudden floods, flooding water, and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes an increase in precipitation between five and about seven and a half centimeters per hour, especially in South Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected that between 5 and 10.16 centimeters of rainfall will be expected in certain areas of the southwest of the United States, especially in Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible due to the dispersal of tropical rains with rapidly worsening conditions.
Surely you should not walk in the desert if tropical rainfalls are threatened.
A strong rain can cause the canyons to become fast - flowing rivers and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by an outbreak of wind and volatile dust.
At times, the approaching low pressure brings with it acute rainfalls in the coastal regions of southern California.
It is possible to have a total rainfall of more than 1.27 centimeters and can cause smaller floods and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
Distributed tropical rainfalls begin to approach Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, rainstorms become extensive on Monday night and Tuesday.
Strong rainfalls reach Four Corner on Tuesday and stay until Wednesday.
In October, large temperature fluctuations are predicted in the US due to the coolness of the Arctic, while temperatures remain high in tropical areas.
Sometimes this leads to major temperature changes in small areas.
The Sunday weather is an excellent example of significant temperature differences in the central part of the United States.
The temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nbraska) as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) range from nearly 20 degrees.
In the next few days, he tries to recover in long summer heat.
A large part of the central and eastern part of the United States is expected to be expected to start warm October with temperatures of around 80 hot air degrees from the southern plane to the northeast of the country.
New York is expected on Tuesday 26.6 hot soak, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that in the East of the United States, in the first half of October, high average temperatures are likely to occur.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial was examined by over 20 million people.
More than 20 million people watched, on Thursday, six TV channels, the confessions involving Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court candidate and the alleged sexual violence of a woman named Christine Blasey Ford in the 1980s.
At the same time, the political impasse continued, in which broadcasters interrupted the display of traditional broadcasts to reflect the last minute turns of Friday: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona prepared a contract for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of charges.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh grabbed him drunk and tried to rip off his wife's clothes at the high school graduation.
Kavanaugh said in his ardent confession that he was absolutely certain that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen’s report, more than 20.4 million people were likely to review the transfer on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other channels, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems calculating the number of people who view transfers by the authorities.
In comparison, it is about the same audience as it is at football finals or Oscars.
Fox News Channel opinion leaders, who have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, managed all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers in a full-day session, said Nielsen.
ABC with 3.26 million viewers remained in second place.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, said Nielsen.
The interest remained great even after the trial.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After a statement by the moderate Republican office that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras hit a man on Friday morning after he had been subjected to a protest by protesters trying to go to the meeting of the Legal Affairs Committee with the elevator.
He was standing in his eyes for several minutes when he was accused and transferred directly to CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
He was told: “You have power, while so many women are completely powerless.”
Mr Flake said that his department issued a statement and added that he had more to say at the meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs before closing the elevator.
The cable and broadcasting networks reflected the live transmission several hours later when the Committee on Legal Affairs had to vote to send the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate for the vote.
But Flake said that he was only doing this in the understanding that the FBI will investigate the charges against the candidate next week, which have been demanded by the Democrats in the minority.
Flake was partly convinced by a conversation with a friend of a Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
The Flake decision had an effect because it was obvious that the Republicans would not get Kavanaugh's votes together without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May blames Brexit's critics for the political game
The Prime Minister blamed those who criticise his plans to leave the European Union, in the "political game" with the future of Britain and in harming national interest, for the interview given to the Sunday Times.
The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, will arrive at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview for the newspaper, on the front page of which Theresa May was with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson pressured his attack on the May so-called Brexit Master Plan, saying that the proposal on the basis of which Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs is "absolutely mindless".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson as a suspect in the murder of a LSU player
Police arrested a man suspected of shooting the death of a 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and put in prison for a second-degree murder charge, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the opposition between Sims and Simpson, and the police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, informed the CBS's TV channel WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wayde dead.
The lawyer stated that the man's bail was set at USD 350 000 (308 600,30).
The East Baton Rouge coroner issued a preliminary report on Friday that the bullet wound caused death in the head of the neck.
The Department thanks the Louisiana Police Task Force on Refugees, the State Police Criminalistics Lab, the Southern University Police and the people living in the region for their assistance in the investigation, which led to the arrest of a suspect.
LSU sports manager Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement bodies in the region for "puting care and justice on the ground".
Sims was 20 years old.
One, 98 meters old man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball in LSU.
The average of his previous season's games was 5.6 points and 2.6 tableballs.
Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the entire team was "beated" and "suck" by Wayde's death.
"It's something you're worried about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano bursts ashes over Mexico City
The ash from a volcano called Popocatepetl has reached the southern parts of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans, telling them to stay away from the volcano, since the crater again began its activity, resulting in 183 cases of gas emissions and ash being recorded within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring a number of myriads and tremors.
The pictures shared in social media represented the windows of an ash - coated car in various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano in the south-east of the capital 72 km after the 7.1 magnetic earthquake rocked the central part of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police are in contact with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the collusive conflict between the protesters of independence and the riot police. Thousands joined the protests against them to celebrate the opposition vote against Catalonia.
A group of masked fighters who were held back by the riot police attacked the last ones with eggs and powder paint, creating thick clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
The raids also occurred later when the police had to use the pussies to control the fights.
For several hours, the defenders of independence who sang “No oblivion, No Forgiveness” collided with protestors in favour of the unity of the state, who called out “Let Spain Live!”
According to the local press, 14 people injured in the demonstration received medical care.
The efforts will continue to rise in the area of independence a year later when Madrid declared the referendum on 1 October illegal, but which the Catalans in favour of the separation marked.
The voters decided overwhelmingly in favour of independence, although the electoral activity was low, as those who opposed the withdrawal largely ignored the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to stop the vote in front of the entire voting stations in the region, leading to violent clashes.
Independence defenders had stayed in front of the polls on Friday night to avoid protests supporting the national police.
The demonstrations took place, however, but they had to take the other way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, who participated in the demonstration of those in favour of divorce with his wife, said that he no longer had the hope of seeing Catalonia independently.
“One of the best moments of our lives took place last year.
I saw my parents crying with joy about the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the important but small victory in the regional elections held last December, it has been difficult for the parties supporting the independence of the Catalans to maintain the will this year, as many of the more well-known leaders have either gone into exile or have been held and await their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic named Joan Puig, who is recording a protest in support of the police with his cell phone, said that the fight was driven from behind by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting tighter,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junquera, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in prison since last year, announced that he would be taking part in the European elections next year.
“Advocating for elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the pressures of the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: The man was arrested because the car was rammed into the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the house was repeatedly crippled by a car in London.
The event took place at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 in British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the gates and the building.
They could also shoot a bow in the direction of the car at some point.
Menga's hit will give Livingston 1-0 win in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston was to win
Promoted by Livingston open Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to the second loss in 18 games during which the man has been the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's impact proved to be decisive when Gary Holt raised the level to Hibernian in a second.
Gerrard will be defeated in the first league this season and will face the leading Hearts next Sunday, of which eight points will be grounded.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Euro League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his unbeatable attack to seven games, while head coach Holt still felt the taste of loss since Kenny Miler's replacement last month.
Livingston loses the chance against the nerdy visitors
Holt's team should have led long before they hit the gate, since their direct play style caused Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts failed in front of the gate where Alan Lithgow made efforts to catch Craig Halkett's head over the gate.
The strangers were calmly allowed to play in front of the Rangers, knowing that they could cause problems for the guests in certain places.
And that's also the way the final goal was hit.
Rangers gave up the free shot, and Livingston had an opportunity to play Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took the ball and succeeded in it from the center of the sentence.
By that time, the Rangers mostly held the ball, but were unable to penetrate the defense, making the gatekeeper Liam Kelly's side mostly calm.
The same pattern continued during the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to protect the gate once.
Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor repelled Scott Pittman's strike and Lithgow gleamed brightly in the back of Livingston's team.
The blows continued to reach the District of Livingston and were consistently thrown out of there. Two punishments were also directed away, one for trying to replace Halkett Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
Phenomenal achievement from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland at the Alasdair Lamont Tony Macao Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was excellent, crossing the ladder, moving up completely the expectations.
Their game style and players have hardly changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt must be respected for how he has banished the team since he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, providing excellently organized protection, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the back legs throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were under inspiration.
Regardless of their in-between good level under Gerrard's leadership, it was not enough, according to the examples here.
Their last possession of the ball proved incomplete: arrival on the home side was only once that could serve as an alarm clock for Rangers located in the central part of the table.
The controversial reception of Erdogan in Cologne
In Berlin on Saturday (September 29), there were both smiles and a cloud of anxiety when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial German-German visit to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been left out on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police referred to security, prohibiting the gathering of 25 000 members in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters appeared near it to see their president.
Hundreds of people opposed Erdogan, most of whom are deaf, also made their voice heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to host the Turkish President in their country.
Fighting demonstrations show that the attitude toward the guest is divided: some Turks in Germany welcome him as a hero, while others despise a man as a self - ruler.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: cyclists killed as a result of a car crash
In London, a cyclist crashed against a car.
The collision took place on the fast road to Deptford near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10:15 p.m.
The driver stopped and the help arrived to give an ambulance, but the man died at the scene.
The collision took place a few months after another cyclist was killed in a collision nearly two kilometres from the Saturday accident site on Childers Street, where the driver who hit the cyclists fled the scene.
The London police said the authorities are working on identifying the man and informing his loved ones.
At the event, traffic is closed and buses are diverted, and drivers of motor vehicles are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison officials were injured in the riots
The prison authority reported that six prison officials were injured by the unrest in a highly secure male prison.
The unrest broke out in His Majesty's Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 09:30 in the British summer time and has not yet ended.
In dealing with one wing of unrest involving eight prisoners, qualified riot police officers are involved.
The prison officials were treated with milder facial injuries at the scene.
“ Specially trained prison workers have been invited to solve the ongoing case in HMP Long Lartin prison, ” said a prison press officer.
Five crew members received medical attention because of the injuries.
We cannot tolerate any violence in our prisons, those responsible for it will be handed over to the police and their prison sentence may be extended."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the warden was informed that he was taken to hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, however, the riot police were called into prison to silence the serious unrest during which prison officials were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden fires (for areas where hurricanes can be useful)
The tropical low pressure does not hit Arizona often, but it is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the ferocious hurricane Rosa moves across the southwest desert, leading to a risk of sudden fires.
The National Weather Service has already arranged for the monitoring of sudden fires on Monday and Tuesdays in the west of Arizona, in the south and east of Nevada, in the south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the prophecy, Rosa will be heading for Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area on Monday with rainfall.
The Phoenix National Weather Service stated that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained levels of tropical storms or low - pressure levels within a range of 321,86 km from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane passing 64.37 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict a rainfall of 5.08 to 10.16 centimeters, which can range up to 15.24 centimeters in the restricted areas of the Arizona Mogolon Rim.
In other desert areas in the southwest of the United States, including the central part of the Rock Mountains and the Great cousin, the rainfall is likely to be between two and a half inches [2.54 to 5.8 cm], extending to 10.16 cm [10.16 cm] in restricted areas.
Rosa’s rainfalls can be a blessing to the areas affected by sudden floods, as the area is in a drought.
Although the floods are very worrying, such rainfall is likely to be useful, as droughts exist in South-East America.
According to a U.S. dry monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is extreme, or the second largest, reported weather.com.
First, the hurricane Rosa Baja California is crossing the mainland of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane level on Sunday morning with the highest windmills of 6.43 kilometers an hour, is now 619.95 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving at a speed of 19.31 kilometers an hour north.
The storm is in contact with cool waters in the Pacific Ocean, which is why it's coming down a little bit.
Thus, Rosa is expected to reach Mexico’s land with tropical storms on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
The number of rainfalls in certain areas of Mexico may be high, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baia California to the North-West of Sonora, we can expect rainfalls ranging from 7.62 to 15.24 centimetres in total, reaching some 25.4 centimetres,” said weather.com.
Rosa then head north into the tropical storm of Mexico, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure unit that moves across Arizona and reaches the southern part of Utah late Tuesday evening.
“The main threat to Rosa or its consequences is very strong rainfalls in Baja California, the Northwest of Sonora and the southwest desert of the United States,” said the National Hurricane Centre.
These rainfalls can cause life - threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests in connection with attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested with suspected murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 04:00, British summer time.
The victim was taken to a hospital in “stable” condition.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old, 20-year-old man was arrested at night in the Radstock area in Avon and Somerset, said the police.
Officials are asking to contact anyone who may have cell phone records on the case.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “suffered” the Democratic Party “under evil and anger”
“Supporting the Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party,” said Trump in his stimulating speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “suffered” during his appointment process, the Democratic Party “under evil and hatred”.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, pressing back the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford, who said that the man attacked her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
He also testified to Ford at the hearing on his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that “America saw Kavanaugh’s glory, quality and courage that day”.
The vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to appoint one of the most respected law experts of our time, who has an impeccable background in the public service," he said to the people supporting West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while at the same time talking about the importance of the Republic's electoral activity in the interim elections.
“Five weeks have remained one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running," he said.
"This is why I am everywhere to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to ‘stitch and stop’.
The first main procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's application is expected to take place no later than Friday, said the senior aid to CNN of the leaders of the Republican Party.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, the number of deaths is rising
At least 384 people were killed and many were washed away when the giant waves hit the beach after the severe earthquake and tsunami hit the Sulawes Island in Indonesia, the authorities announced on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had met at the beach festival in the town of Pau on Friday, when during the eve of the day, the waves of six metres had been created, killing a lot of people and destroying everything that was left on the beach.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnetic earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people still did their work on the beach, not immediately fled, thus remaining victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the press conference of the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Relief at Jakarta.
“Tunami didn’t come alone, but took with him cars, logs and houses, wiping everything off the ground,” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km/h on the high seas before reaching the shore.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived, he said.
Approximately 16 700 people were evacuated to request 24 centres.
The air photos published by the disaster agency showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The follow-up in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
In the region with 2.4 million inhabitants, there was a wave of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) stated in its statement that the energy released after a strong earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times that of a nuclear bomb crashed into Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami, BPPT said.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number and damage of the victims could be higher in the 300 km north of Pala, known as Dongala, which was closer to the middle of the earthquake.
The reports from Dongala “are completely incomplete and do not contain any information,” said Nugroho.
“The region has more than 300 000 inhabitants,” said the Red Cross in its statement, adding that its team and volunteers are heading for the affected places.
“It is already a tragedy that can get worse,” he said.
The Agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing the tsunami in the town of Phu, although the authorities said that the waves reached the beach at the same time as the warning was issued.
Amateur cameras in the social media show a man on the upper floor of a building that is alarming panicously warning people on the street below of the approaching tsunami.
Minutes later, the water wall reaches the beach, carrying houses and cars with it.
Reuters failed to confirm the accuracy of the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that hindered communication in the Palu region and made it difficult for the authorities to organise rescue work.
The military has begun sending transport aircraft from Jakarta and other cities to help the authorities, but the evacuationrs still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue work, while remaining closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami increased by over 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision workers from Dongala safely arrived in the town of Phu, where they are hidden in the tents set up in their office yard, they saw the shocking visions on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
“They said you saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Although relief operations were strongly initiated by the armed forces, some complained that workers of highly experienced foreign aid organisations were prevented from travelling to Prussa.
According to the Indonesian rules, funds, stocks and backup forces may be deployed abroad only if the accident site is declared to be a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at province level,” said Aulia Arrian, a pressman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can start to accept international aid, but this state has not yet been declared."
When the second night came after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing were still full of hope that their loved ones would be the wonderful events that alleviate natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer well.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who was trapped by her mother’s body in the rubble for two days.
In fact, the Indonesian National Skillower Team coach Gendon Subandono trained two missing Skillowers for Asian games that took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The rest of those trapped in Roa Roa's hotel are his students, added Mr. Mandagi.
“I have a personal burden as a senior slider,” he said.
Mr. Gendon was talking about how, after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa's hotel, he was desperate to send whatsHelp messages to the competitors who were at the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one grey bird instead of two blue birds.
“I think that means the messages didn’t get there,” he said.
Thiefs took EUR 23 585,88 during the ATM in Newport on the Levees
On Friday morning, the thieves stole EUR 23 585,88 from a banker in Brink, who was in charge of the Levees ATM, were published in a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptied the ATM at the entertainment facility and made the production to bring more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a press release.
When the man acted, “the other man ran behind Brink’s employee” and stole a delivery bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects running from the scene, wrote a press release, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the early persons will be asked to contact the Newport Police by telephone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper takes his new name Ye
Rapper Kanye West turns his name into Ye.
On Saturday, on Twitter, a man wrote, "Former Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for some time, and the man also used the name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change will take place before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where a man is expected to publish his new album Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grande in the show, who cancelled his concert with “Emotions,” said the author of the show.
In addition to being a brief on a man’s present performer’s name, the West has previously said that it is a word of religious importance to him.
"I think that "ye" is one of the most widely used words in the Bible, which means "you" there," said West earlier, discussing the name of his album with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am we, it is us.
I changed my name from Kanyest, meaning "this one", called Ye, which is only a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion, and everything else.
The Album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye West is not the only rapper who plays with his name.
Sean Combs is known mainly under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z has also used its name with and without a sign of thought, capitals and small letters.
Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians
At a time when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody attacks on students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he will never use the military against civilians.
On Sunday, Lopez Obrador promised Tlatelco Plazas that “he will never use the army to control the Mexicans”.
The military attacked the peaceful demonstration of October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were being carried throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by paying their students monthly grants and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double financing for artificial intelligence.
“As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount allocated to research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, the financier and artificial intelligence agent, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were published after various parts of the US government made statements on artificial intelligence, although the US does not have an overall official strategy on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, China introduced its plan last year to be a player in the renewal of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Dualising the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that other countries are so much behind the US and we are acting in the name of the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," said Lee.
The double funding would double the likelihood that the next major artificial intelligence achievement would be made in the United States, said the interview to Lee CNBC this week.
Lee, published this month the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of the most outstanding artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that won the best Othello player in America. Later, he was a man on Microsoft Research's board and a president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognised the previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place to help identify the next dreamers.
“US scientists have to work hard to get government funding,” said Lee.
“China is not the one that takes over the intellectuals, it is the companies,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired excellent scientists from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the US support artificial intelligence efforts.
“I think people who have received a doctorate in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered a green card,” said the man.
The Chinese State Council published the next generation of artificial intelligence development plans in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Science Foundation distributes funding to people working in academic institutions as well as how the public research fund and other government agencies allocate money to US scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defence set up a pooled Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve partners from both industry and educational institutions, while the White House announced the establishment of a committee selected for artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced that it had started financing the two-million-dollar initiative AI Next.
But the public research fund is currently financing over 100 million dollars a year for research into artificial intelligence.
At the same time, there has been no change to the US legislation aimed at setting up a National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the national name
In a referendum on Sunday, the Macedonians voted on whether to change the name of the country into the Republic of North Macedonia, a step which would also resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented the confirmation of the declarations of Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
Greece, where there is a province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a requirement for that territory and has prohibited Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
In June, the governments of the two countries agreed on a new name for Macedonia, but national opponents claim that the name would damage the national identity of the Slavic people of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he did not intend to take part in the referendum and that the rejection campaign had raised doubts as to whether the electoral activity would reach the 50% required for the referendum.
The referendum asks: "Are you in favour of Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU by agreeing to an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth paying to ensure its accession to organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protective hand of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they are following the result of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required for change of name.
The National Election Commission said that there are no reports of irregularities at 13:00.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia.
On 30 September 2018, the Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and their son, Dushko, voted in the Macedonian referendum on a change in the name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliamentary building in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage, raising chairs in front of tents for those who fail to hold a referendum.
“We want to belong to NATO and the EU, but we want to join the head up, not through the door of the servants,” said Kavaldarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not wish to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring more than 20% of unemployment into Macedonia with the necessary investments.
“I believe that a large majority supports the change of name because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of membership of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after his vote.
He said "yes" would be "confirmation of our future".
The results of the survey published by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Studies on Monday revealed that 30-43% of voters are intending to participate in the referendum, which is below the required electoral activity.
The survey carried out by FYROM TV revealed that 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said you would say yes.
The success rate of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the government's Western policy after the government took over last May.
See: Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero goes through Brighton's defense on behalf of the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defense, ensuring Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look like the gate he hit on his 65th game minute was ridiculously easy.
The assailant in Argentina passed through the central field at the beginning of the sequence.
He broke through three Brighton defenders before he got into the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He penetrated another protector before he ran past several players at the border of Brighton's crime zone.
Then he hit the ball on his left, where Sterling was.
The British attacker used the first blow to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right leg to strike the Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan on the right side of the net.
“Aguerol has leg problems,” said Manchester City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We told him he was playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he hit the gate at the moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial success in the Premier League struggle.
The gate was hit at 29 minutes.
Aguero got a ball in this game clearly in Brighton's territory.
He sent the ball from the air to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane was able to hit the ball a few times before he drove Sterling further.
Sky Blues put the ball in the net just before it slipped out of the borders.
Manchester City will play with Hoffenheim in the League of Champions at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play cheerleading against Rockies.
When the Nationals were excluded from the finals, there was no reason for a new start.
However, the fighting Scherzer hopes to take down Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only when Rockie, who runs the Los Angeles Dodgers with one game in the NL West, still has hope of getting to the final.
Rockies guaranteed 5-2 of the Nationals' winnings on Friday night at least a joke point, but the team still wants to secure their first division.
“While we don’t play for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing with this audience and another team in the atmosphere in Denver is probably at a higher level than any other game I can expect this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete here?"
The Nationals have not yet appointed a Sunday beginner, but they are allegedly inclined to the Scherzer feed in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th feeding, made a heating session on Thursday and a regular Sunday meal.
This Washington right-hand player controls 18-7, his ERA is 2.53, the number of hits 300 and the favorable options of his 220 2/3 this season.
Trump's making a cheer call in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court, while at the same time talking about the importance of the Republic's electoral activity in the mid-term elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before our lifetime, one of the most important elections.
This is a big event that I do not run for, but I am actually running for, which is why I am everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You will see this terrible, extremely terrible group of democracies, and you will see it taking place in front of your own eyes.
And they've decided to take back the power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over for power and control. The only thing they want is power and control over everything, and we don't give it to them."
According to him, the Democrats are on a mission that aims to ‘stitch against and prevent’.
"And you have seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "fashion, evil, naked, and lying."
He referred, by name, to a Democrat member of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, Senator Diane Feinstein, who was screaming out loud in the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, wait – it was one of the worst body language examples, in fact, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a big connection.
This is unacceptable to those who express their opinion
When my local party Momentum activists voted to condemn me, it wasn't surprising.
After all, I am the last on the list of Labour MEPs to whom you are told that you are not welcome, and all for expressing your opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received the same treatment because he was strongly in favour of anti-Jewishism.
In my case, the judges criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which, in a strange way, are similar subjects on which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Party's statement stated that "we wish the meetings would be inclusive and creative."
Most of my eight-year local Labour Member's experience with meetings of the General Assembly on Friday nights is exactly that.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the case for most of the meetings today, and the promise to be more “beneficial and generous” in politics has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different perspectives are not acceptable in the Labour Party and that each opinion will be evaluated who is acceptable to the Board of Directors of the Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and the co-worker with whom I thought I would have previously shared similar political views now expected me to change my mind and adopt positions that I would never have agreed to otherwise, regardless of whether they were issues of national security or of the EU single market.
Every time I step up in public, regardless of what I really say, it is followed by a condemnation in social media, encouraging my recall, ignoring party politics, and saying that I should not belong to the Labour Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my fellow workers, because my comments are mostly political.
I admire the competence and decision-making of those fellow workers who face sexual or racist abuse every day, but never swear.
One of the most disappointing views in this policy area is how the levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we are no longer such a large association and that by changing every "confidence" initiative or electoral rule, the party is becoming narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head down, to talk less, and "it'd be okay."
But that's not what I'm here to do in politics.
Since I joined the Labourist Party as a school student 32 years ago, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which had left my large school classroom literally on the verge of collapse, I have tried to speak for better public services to those who need it most, acting as a member of the local council and government minister.
I have never hidden my policy, including in the last elections.
There is no way that anyone in Nottingham East was confused about my political stances or areas of disagreement with local leadership.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is moving towards Brexit, which is damaging households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my supporters, whether they belong to the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one of the threats or political considerations of recall will stop me from acting on behalf of what I think is in your best interests.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr moves to the top
Two late events may have slightly tilted the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win this wonderfully fun Tennent first league game.
They're now the only unbeatable team in the top of the table.
Finally, it was a high level of protection for the team and a better risk-taking, which led the home team to victory and Coach Peter Murchiel has the full right to be satisfied.
“We have been tested all the time during the games and are still unbeatable, so of course I am happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "I'm gonna respect Ayr, they used their options better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th game-minute attempt, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a head start, but the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was handed over to the Warriors, gave Melros the opportunity to make a failed attempt.
Climo increased the success of Ayr with a penalty strike just before the end of the half-life, reaching a single event in favour of Ayr by the end of the half-life of 17-5.
But Melrose successfully started the second half, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, which he took over Baggot, reduced the gap by five points.
Then a long delay occurred due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knox, after which the man was taken away on the carrier frame. As the game continued, Ayr increased the progress of Stafford McDowall’s experiment, which was transmitted by Climo.
Ayri Executive Captain Blair Macpherson was then on the yellow card, but again Melrose's player paid Bruce Colvine's attempt to pass the failed transmission after heavy pressure.
However, the team playing in the home field again gained strength, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for Climo’s inhibition without a ball in the line of punishment, MacPherson put the ball behind the progressive Aries.
Climo gave the ball forward, as he did almost immediately after the game continued, when Kyle Rowe tried to hit David Armstrong's box and sent a side guard to Gregor Henry to leave the home field in the fifth attempt of the team.
Still Game star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game's star Ford Kieran seems ready to take up the hospitality business after it was discovered that the man was appointed director of a recognised restaurant company.
56-year-old actor plays in a known BBC TV series from Jack Jarvis, which he writes and plays with long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
A couple have reported that the ninth season ahead will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan will make his life after Craiglang's new plans.
According to official records, he is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow’s “flavouring restaurant business”.
"The sea is ours": the sealess Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way for them to the Pacific
Marines patrol the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
The blue flags of the ocean are floating over the buildings of the agency.
The Marine Bases from Lake Titica to Amazon have been drawn to the slogan: “The sea is our right.
It is our duty to restore it."
In Bolivia, with no sea borders, there is a memory of the coastline that was lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, still alive. The same living thing is the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has a spirit of momentum, unity and peace, and the country is naturally waiting for a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
A number of Bolivians across the country are looking at the decision of the International Court on the big screens, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia, after which Chile will be obliged to negotiate with Bolivia for decades of continuous discussions in order to give the latter an independent path to the sea.
The charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who is facing a conflict of election next year, is at great risk in a Monday's decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not vote in favour of Bolivia, or if so, it would become very little.
The UN authority in the Netherlands has no power to abandon Chile and has provided that it does not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is taken only six months after the hearing of the final statements indicates that it was not a “complicated case,” said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law in Chile.
And further away from Bolivia’s additional reasons, the last four years may have made the situation worse.
“The problem of access to sea has been robbed by the current Bolivian authorities,” Zárate said.
Morales has lost all remaining Chilean goodwill, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile are continuing to negotiate at some point, but after all this, the debate is extremely difficult.
Two countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is a representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the Court was unnecessarily urgent.
Monday gives Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile” and the opportunity “to end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefit,” she said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most well-known Presidents in Latin America, is using the maritime issue to express political hatred.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific,” she added.
"It's a chance to see that we have to get over the past."
North Korea said that the release of nuclear weapons will not take place until the United States can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will never give up nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Meeting on Saturday.
He called on the United States of America to review the promises made to each other by the competition leaders during the Singapore Summit.
He comments at the time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo almost seems to be re-launching a deadlock in nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Uni.
According to Ri, these are air castles, thinking that the United States continues to be restricted and refusing to end the war with Korea will make North Korea give up.
Washington will take such a statement with caution if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards armaments.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, scepticism is widespread, according to which Pyongyang intends to seriously abandon the armament that the State is likely to see as the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion fairs bring to the viewer a series of massive top covers brought to buyers on the shopping streets in their neighbourhood
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don’t have to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought on stage a series of strange super-high-ends during their summer season in 2019, which blinded Paris’s fashion week.
High and impractical hats are in fashion this summer via Instagram, and these designers have sent their walking works to fashion.
Valentino's top piece was an oversold beige hat covering the heads of the models, decorated with a broad edge that resembled the seals.
Other exceedingly large clothing consisted of jewelry - decorated watermelons, a magic hat, and even a pineapple, but their purpose is not to heat the head.
Thom Browne also showed a strange selection of masks, doing it just in time before Halloween.
Most of the colored masks had sutured mouths so that they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than they did in a high way.
One part of the work resembled the diving costume with the air pipe and glasses, while the other resembled the melted ice cream.
And if you keep up with the giant moorings, you'll be lucky.
The Moegurus predict that the super-large top covers can reach the shopping streets in your vicinity.
The super-sized hats come right after La Bomba, a six - inch [60 cm] - wide shoulder hat, seen in the heads of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult trade mark, which created a highly impractical hat in social media, sent another great work — a shoulder beach bag that is almost as large as the bikini model that bears it.
The dark orange raffia bag with raffias and white leather sang was the top piece of Jacquemus La Riviera summer collection 2019 in Paris's fashion week.
Famous Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing large hats and beach bags on shopping streets next summer. As the designer has had such an impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for exceedingly large clothing.”
John Edward: Language skills are important for world citizens
Scottish private schools have remained at the top of the academic top-level ranking and continued in 2018 with the following outstanding test results, reinforced by personal and joint success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, where more than 30 000 students study all over Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Private Schools Council (SCIS), seek to provide the best service for their students and their parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a curriculum adapted to the circumstances, we can see that modern languages are still well-known and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you speak to a person in a language that he understands, it will come to his head.
When you speak to him in his native language, it reaches his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to establish a relationship and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent test results this year, we can see that at the top of the tables are the languages in which the rate of passing the exams is highest among private schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received a high result, A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 per cent of students received an A grade in Mandarin, 72 per cent of students in German, 69 per cent of students in French and 63 per cent of students in Spanish.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign languages as vital skills for life that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
The languages that are now among the choice of subjects are the same in the curriculum of private schools and other schools as in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A study carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that, among the reasons why employers find it difficult to find workers for job vacancies, 17% of respondents showed lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly compulsory to prepare young people for their future work.
To the extent that more promising job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice you have made, the acquisition of another language gives a real advantage to a person in the future, as language skills are lifelong.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign citizens gives multilingual people immediate competitive advantage.
According to a survey carried out by YouGov in 2013 by more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent of respondents do not speak any foreign language well enough to have a conversation about it. The only language with a two-digit percentage was French by 15 percent.
Therefore, funding for language learning is important for children today.
The skills of several languages, especially those of developing economies, provide better opportunities for children to find a good job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
A number of schools focus on classical modern languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child’s interest, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between several languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the skills needed to achieve success regardless of what the future will bring them.
It can no longer be denied that languages are crucial for the future of the country in a globalised business environment, and must therefore also be reflected in education.
It is precisely modern languages that should be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Private schools continue to offer young Scottishs choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Private Schools Council.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The eager admirers no longer have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut in the L.A. Lakers.
Coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason preseason opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But his number of minutes of play still needs to be determined.
“It is more than one and less than 48,” said Walton Lakers on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell stated that James is likely to play a counted number of minutes.
After last week's training, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' six - game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need preseason games at this stage of my career to warm up,” he said.
Trump West Virginia election campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin his election campaign event series tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first campaign event scheduled for the next week, including stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
At the same time as the vote of approval stands until Trump selects who to appoint as the Supreme Court's free seat, he will seek to increase support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are threatened by the abolition of control in Congress following the vote in November.
What time is Trump's campaign event in West Virginia tonight and how to view it online?
Trump's campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place this Saturday evening on 29 September 2018 at 19:00 due to the east coast.
The Trump Western Virginia campaign event can be watched online via YouTube streaming.
Trump is probably talking about the hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, this week, which became tense with the charges of sexual misconduct, while the Senate's confirmation vote has been suspended for a week while the FBI is investigating the case.
However, the main aim of the campaign series is to help the Republicans who are facing difficult elections in November.
Thus, the campaign manager of President Trump said that the aim of these five events next week is to “encourage volunteers and supporters when the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority of their members in the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives”,
“The control of the Congress is so important for the President’s agenda that Trump is going to the fast-tracking campaign season to dive into as many states as possible,” said a pressman for the Trump campaign to Reuters, who did not want to mention his name.
This evening’s campaign event, scheduled for the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, can be attended by supporters from “Ohios and Pennsylvania and will also be reflected in the Pittsburgh media,” announced Western Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, this is the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the last month. It is a state where a man received more than 40 per cent of the voters' votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in charge of the polls.
“For Morrisey, this is not a good sign that the President has come to stimulate his results,” said Simon Haeder, politicallogist at the University of West Virginia, announced Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is nervous, keeping the hopes of Sunday’s single games high
After three unilateral sessions, the games that took place on Saturday afternoon were sometimes exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating turning point pendulum is a completely fictional concept in sport, but players really believe it, especially in competitions like this one.
So where do they think the turning point is now?
“They led by six points, which have now become four, so I think I can view it as a turning point in a small way,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, it is clear, because it is driven by four points and there are 12 points in the game.
According to Spieth, the Americans feel that they do not have enough wind on their sails, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each received three out of four points.
Spieth has been a foothold for both tii and grin and sets an example.
These win-calls from the throat became more and more loud in every circle, clouding the decisive putt that would have led to the fourth match after he and Thomas were down with two.
His putt, which won the match on the 15th, sent a similar cry that showed a man's belief that the Americans are not yet out of the race.
“You just have to play more focus and worry about your fight,” Spieth said.
It's the only thing players can do.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players who have more points after the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are Ryder Cup's undisputed stars on Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe is strange, but the loved couple is four out of four, and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine Friday morning.
This game and the way their energy flows into such a loud crowd as it does back there strengthens the view that the players with whom they compete on Sunday, and that when the sun sets over the Le Golf National, there is no more well-known player than Fleetwood or Molinari to confirm a possible victory for Europe.
Preferred to both at the same time in different holes.
However, the talk of Europe's glory is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did Sergio Garcia, this morning's four-ball hero, fast work when the man was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and the two doubles in the first nine dug the Spanish and Swedish into such a deep hole that they had no hope of digging themselves out of it.
There's no one on Saturday to help you out.
Four-balls and pair games are extremely fascinating to look closely at the relationship between couples, advice given to each other, unsolicited advice and how the way can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken the lead for the last day, but this Quartet session has shown that the US team has a lot of nerves in which some, especially the Americans, have doubts.
Europe is taking the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup 10-6
Europe will have a great success on the last day of Ryder Cup, starting to lead 10 to 6 in front of the United States after the four-balls and the match on Saturday.
The great duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led a two-win in front of the struggling Tiger Woods to raise their current score in Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who contributed two years ago to the preservation of the cup lost in Hazeltine, ruled after the failure on the American side in the morning four-ball, winning the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance to the match, winning two games, but they could not make up for the deficit.
Jim Furyk's party will need eight points of 12 single-game on Sunday to keep a cup.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. Together with Molinar, who after such a fun weekend is called Molliwood, they are the second couple to win four points in Ryder Cup's history.
After destroying the four-ball Woods and Patrick Reed, they continued in the same spirit by defeating Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau more firmly: 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed a random shine, but now lost 29 of his four-balls and 19 of his double-games, losing seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested out in the morning for four-balls, returned with partner Henrik Stenson to the double game, winning 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who is the first and third in the world ranking.
Europe did not succeed, although the competition was held in a pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
Three major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won in four-balls a solid victory over 2-1 Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, returning later and winning Poulter and Rory McIlroyd 4-3 after losing two openings.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has the team come back from a four-point deficit, going to single games, although as owners Furyk only needs a tie to keep the cup.
Although two days in the second position, after a Sunday’s counterattack, they seem to fail.
North Korea says "no way" they're not arming themselves unilaterally because of a lack of trust.
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that their distrust of the United States was compounded by continued restrictions and that the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual meeting of the World Organisation that North Korea has taken “a significant amount of goodwill” over the last year, such as the suspension of nuclear and missile experiments, the dismantling of the nuclear testing site and the promise not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we do not see that the United States has responded,” he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, our country lacks security and, in such circumstances, we are in no way willing to unilaterally defuse ourselves first."
While Ri repeated the familiar complaints of North Korea regarding the D.C. opposition to the "progressive" approach to nuclear non-proliferation, on the basis of which North Korea will be rewarded if it takes gradual steps, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject unilateral non-proliferation, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Uni and Donald Trump on 12 June between the President of the United States and the leader of North Korea at the Singapore Summit, when Kim promised to move towards a ‘no-proliferation of the Korean peninsula’ and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea has requested the official end of the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax the strict international restrictions on North Korea.
"The United States is calling for "the first to abandon nuclear weapons" and increases pressure on restrictions to achieve their objective by coercion, even against the declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
“The idea that restrictions put us on our knees is a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that further restrictions will deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for Kim and Trump's second summit, which the US leader in the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted the meeting between the three leaders of Kim and South Korea, Moon Jae-in, which took place in the last five months, and added: "If the issue of nuclear weapons were one of the parties to the issue of South Korea and not the US, the issue of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock."
However, Ri's speech was very different from last year's when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to turn North Korean missiles to the U.S. continent after Mr. Bad President Trump called Kim a suicide bomber on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea in the United Nations to the heavens of Kim, approved his courage to take steps towards becoming unarmed, but added that there is still a lot to be done and that the restrictions must remain in force until the withdrawal of North Korea's nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no schedule for this, saying, "Does it take two years, three years or five months - not important?"
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should honour the measures taken by Pyongyang.
At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The restrictions of the Security Council must continue to apply forcefully and without fail until we can fully and definitively confirm the abandonment of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions applicable to North Korea by seeking to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Riga next to the UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
After his meeting with Pyongyang in July, he said that progress had been made after what North Korea condemned only a few hours after “gangster-like demands. ”
This month, North Korea promised to break down missiles and nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon if the United States implemented "corresponding measures".
He said that Kim had told him that under the "similar measures", it meant the security guarantees allowed in Trump Singapore and the move towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn How to Rest Enough
This year, Harvard University offers a new course where students need to sleep more to combat the growing aggressive culture where they learn about caffeine with the help of night-long learning marathons.
Students who love the academics of the best university in the world are often helpless when it comes to basics of taking care of themselves.
The designer of this course, the sleep doctor of Harvard Medical School and the expert professor of Brigham and Women's Hospital, Charles Czeisler, thinks it's the first one in the United States.
He was inspired by the creation of a course after he gave a speech on how sleep disorders affect learning.
"At the end of this one girl came to me and asked, "Why is it only now, in my last year of school?
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of the dream - it made me look bad," he explained to Telegraph.
The course, which came first in the curriculum this year, explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports outcomes and also improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and university health director, said that the university decided to take a course on the curriculum after it was found that the students were in severe sleep deprivation during the work week.
An hourly course covers a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, a picture of the joint settlement is presented. Students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books and explain to them how caffeine and light affect the sports performance and the importance of the sleep-free practice.
The second part explains how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The city map, along with the interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily custom.
“We know that this does not change the way students behave immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the proudness of night learning marathons remains, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means, however, that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
“Encouraging a low-quality sleep garden should be the student’s secret weapon to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety,” he added. “This helps even against weight gain, since sleep deprivation makes the brain hungry, constantly making the person hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler establish a course after attending one of his classes in his first Harvard year.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to contribute to the creation of a university course.
As a next step, he would like all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set the alarm clock both for bed and wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screens and LED light, as this could damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Gate defeated Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another poor guest game when Dolly Menga's strike, sent by Steven Gerrard, brought a 1-0 victory to Livingston.
Ibrox hoped to win his first guest victory since February, when 4-1 St Johnstone was defeated, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second loss as a leader in 18 games, behind Ladbrokes Premiership's lead in Hearts with eight points.
Menga created its gate seven minutes before the Polish time, and the poor readiness of the Rangers couldn't recover from it.
The Rangers will therefore fall to the sixth position, Livingston will rise to the third position, falling below Hibernian with only one gate.
For Rangers, problems may not be over, because their attacker, Calum Spence, needed a head wound after he was apparently hit by a discarded object.
Gerrard made eight changes on the side that led to the Ayr and the Betfred Cup semifinal.
At the same time, Holt went along with Liv's 11 who scored from Hearts last week, and he would have been happy with the way his well-trained boys suffocated his opponents every step of the way.
Rangers may have been more dominant in the village, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have hit the gate on the second opening minute Menga's first shift sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's gate, but the halfback didn't take advantage of his chance.
The deep Keaghan Jacobs' release was then discovered by Captain Craig Halkett, but its defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide-stamp in the rear post.
Although the Rangers achieved control, they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt confident that he should have been punished when he collided with Steven Lawless on his 15th game minute, Judge Steven Thomson failed to satisfy the Columbia player's complaint.
During the first half, Rangers managed to hit the target only two times, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried about Lasana Coulibaly's main event or Ovie Ejaria.
Although Liv’s 34th - minute opening may have broken the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely because of their performance.
Once again, the Rangers couldn't control Jacobs' deep heavy performance.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher created a ball for Scott Robinson, who maintained peace and chose Menga, who just finished the plan.
Gerrard acted during the break, switching from Coulibaly Ryan Kent, and that exchange almost paid off when the outcast split up Morelos, but impressive Kelly rushed to stop him.
But Livingston continued to attract guests to play exactly the type of game that suits them where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
The Holt side could have promoted its leadership at the final stage, but McGregor stood firm, blocking Jacobs before Lithgow hit the corner with a big curve.
Glenn Middleton, the replacement for the Rangers, once again applied for a punishment when Jacobs and Jacobs were in a fight, which Thomson again failed to satisfy.
Almanah: Geiger counter inventor
And now the page of our Sunday Morning Almanah: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and LONDADES ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. It was an invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger counter.
From this foundation of science Geiger also became the foundation of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Coronado Watches, where they were seemingly unlikely to be cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When wearing these earphones, you can hear the nucleus of atoms separated from the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Don't tell me, it's gonna be a fight!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” false cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the cells of the fraud and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system how to feel as part of the treatment of fraud cells
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them to the laboratory.
They can then ‘see’ the common protein for many cancers and are injected back
The study vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system how to detect a fraud cell disappeared from her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient. These cells are modified in the laboratory to obtain a ‘sight’ protein that is common in various HER2 cancers and then injected back into the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “leads the growth of many types of cancer”, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach has been used to treat certain types of leukaemia when taking immunocells and teaching them to target cancer cells.

On Saturday Night Live's studio, Kanye West was heard by a defamatory whistle choir, following his confused speech, in which he approved Donald Trump, President of the United States, and announced his nomination to the same post in 2020.
After that night his third song, which was named Ghost Town and where he wore a hat with a letter from Make America Great, he began playing against the same Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“I have spoken so much to the white people who ask me, ‘How can you like Trump? He is a race?’
“If I were so worried about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL started a device with Matt Damon, where Hollywood fame made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee of Judges regarding alleged sexual violence by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this part of the show didn't go on the air, West's sounding cameras were loaded into the social media of the comedian Chris Rock.
It's been unclear if Rock was trying to mock West's post.
He also complained to the West audience that he was having a pretty hard time behind the scenes about his hat.
“They made fun of me behind the stage.
They said I wouldn't go in there with a hat in my head.
They made fun of me!
And then they say I'm drowned in the place," he said according to the Washington Examer.
West continued: “You want to see a drowned place? I put on my Superman’s cape, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
According to Variety, one person said: “The studio was quieted to death.”
West was presented at the last moment to replace Ariana Grande because the singer's ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, was dead a few days earlier.
West amazed many with the song I Love it, and at the time he looked like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who said: "To one brave soul: Today, you must not be afraid of the people."
But the broadcast manager Karen Hunter said that the West was just “the one he is, and it's absolutely wonderful.”
“But I did not choose to reward (by buying my music or clothing or by supporting his “art”) someone who, in my opinion, believes and disseminates a harmful world view to my community.
He's free.
Like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he's changed his name by saying that he's now "former Kanye West."
He's not the first singer to change his singing name following Diddy, who's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg has also been named Snoop Lion and, of course, the recently lost musical legend Prince, who changed his name into a symbol.
Attempted murder charges related to the stabilization of Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Local Register Court on Monday.
The prosecution will be examined by the public prosecutor's office.
Throne game fame Kit Harington does not approve cool masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the flashing role of his sword Jon Snowina HBO in the violent medieval fantasy series of the Troons.
But the actor (31) puts down an aggressive hero’s stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be harsh.
Talking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that “nothing has gone wrong” and raised the question of how to solve the cool masculine problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie (31) of his troons game, admitted that he felt “very strongly” that this problem needed attention.
“I personally feel quite strongly now that we have gone wrong with manhood somewhere,” he said.
“What have we taught men when they grow up about the problem we now see?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in masculinity, because it shows supermanic characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What they teach on TV and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they have to be exactly what they want to be men.
I think it's really one of the biggest questions of our time - how to change it?
'Cause obviously, something's gone wrong for young men."
In the poll he also admitted that after the end of the series next summer he would never participate in any of the Troon games, saying that he was “on the same side with his battlefields and horses”.
Since November, Kit Sam is participating in the revival of Shepard True West, which tells a story about the filmmaker and his robbery brother.
The actor recently announced that he would consider a meeting with his wife Rose to be the best thing about the Troon game.
“I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” she said.
Rose played Ygritte, Kit's character Jon Snow, in an award-winning fantasy series with Emmy.
A couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by a leap to 14%.
According to healthcare professionals, more than 820,000 people suffer from this disease.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have emerged from sex, changing the past.
In ancient times, HIV was transmitted by blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had fallen to almost zero, the Chinese health officials confirmed at the conference in Yunnan province.
Annually, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT and LGBT people is allegedly high.
Due to the country's old values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many transfers of diseases are linked to insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has allowed general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leaking of the employee's GOP senator's data, saying that these are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, American representative Maxine Waters condemned the allegations that his employee had posted the personal data of three Republican US senators on the legislative Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are disseminated by “ultra-right” trolls and their websites.
“Valences, lies, and even more detestable lies,” Waters said in his Twitter statement.
The information published allegedly included home addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both from Utah).
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Panel regarding the allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Pre-existing websites such as Gateway Pundt and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to Waters' office and issued member information to Waters' employee, reported Hill.
“This unjustified claim is a complete and absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“My employees whose identity, personal data and safety are at risk because of their fraudulent and false claims are in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unjustified claim is a complete and irrefutable lie."
Waters’ statement was quickly evaluated on the Internet, including one of the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is due to anger,” wrote Fleischer.
“ This suggests that he has a way of feeling that is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they haven't done, they mustn't get mad.
They mustn't be rude.
They must not question the prosecution's motives.
They have to stay calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by the critics of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s important if it’s the truth,” he declared.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned "the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities regarding their fraudulent claims."
“We will do everything we can to identify criminals,” he continued, “and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are devastating and dangerous to all my employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Against Overview - Underarmed Rowan Atkinson spy parody
It is now common practice to search for Brexit's meanings in all new British films, and this seems particularly appropriate in the Johnny English Momentum Parody - which started with Johnny English in 2003 and became a result of the resurgence of Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Are you making fun of yourself in humor, how clearly stupid are we in the new export possibility of the country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English has obtained permission to do things in his own way once again - and that this broad comical creation is intended for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, it's a secret agent who, despite his strange pretentious smoothie glamour, looks a little like Clouseau, a little like Mr. Bean, and a little like a character who gave a tone to Chariots of Fire's character at the 2012 opening ceremony of the London Olympics.
It is also based on the traveler and the international mysterious Atkinson, once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, which leaves nothing but chaos.
There's only one or two pleasant moments in this last JE movie.
I liked the approach to Johnny English's helicopter when he wore a medieval iron suit, and the helicopter's wings would just use his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is shown, but humor seems less important and strangely overstated, especially when “serious” spy films such as 007 and Mission Impossible are also confidently offering comedy.
It seems that this humor is more for children than for adults, and for me, Johnny English's clever adventures are not as resourceful and focused as the Atkinson's dark movies Beanina.
For the time being, it is always a real assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber hacker has penetrated the British network of top-secret spies, exposing the identities of all British secret police officers, thereby disappointing the local agent - a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a festive and troubled character who suffers from the burden of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing this Teresa-May character excellently, but there is not much to work on in the manuscript.
His intelligence counselors suggest that since all active spies are at risk, he must call back someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster in a proud institution, giving secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a few good places where English offers a school of Rock-type spy school.
English will be returned to Whitehall for extraordinary information and reunited with its former long-term partner Bough, who will be played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the captain of the submarine, where actress Vicki Pepperdine's talents have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, the disgraces of His Majesty's secret service are back in action, meeting Olga Kurolenko's embroidered beautiful femne fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling under the arms of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve all British computer problems: the unhappy Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start with their jinxed odyssey: hiding themselves as waiters, they set fire to the French restaurant; they create chaos, secretly control Volta's luxury hunt on board; and English launches genuine order while trying to use the main set of virtual reality to get to know the interior of Volta's house.
No brakes are used in this last section, but as cute and rushy as it is, the whole thing is about children's TV candy.
It's a little mediocre stuff.
And as with other Johnny English films, I found myself thinking: does the British film industry really not have a role to play for Rowan Atkinson that is fair to his talent?
The working party refuses to draw up a plan where the British work four days a week, but they are paid five days ago.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has considered a revolutionary plan that foresees that the British will work four days a week, but they will be paid five days a day.
The party wants the company's managers to pass on the savings generated through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to employees, giving them one more day off.
That's how employees would have a three-day weekend - but they'd get the same pay.
According to the source, this idea would be compatible with the Party's Economic Action Plan, and so the country will be tilted for the benefit of the workers.
The Thursday working week has been approved at the Trade Union Congress so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
The Labour Party’s source told The Sunday Times: “The review of the Bill is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"This is not happening overnight, but Thursday's work week is an effort that is compatible with the party's approach to balancing the economy, both for the benefit of workers and for the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a Thursday working week during its election campaign in 2017.
However, the effort is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party Press Officer stated: “The four-day work week is not party politics and the party does not discuss it.”
Secretary John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist turnout in the economy.
McDonnell said that he has decided to take back the power from the "showed managers" and "profit-services" of public utility companies.
The plans of the Aseccator also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not be able to regain all their participation, as the Labour Party could make "deductions" in relation to perceived misdemeanour.
He confirmed his plan to put employees in company boards and to create inclusive equity funds to provide 10% of private companies' equity to employees, instead of providing annual bonuses of up to EUR 561.65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on the 60 Minutes show whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the application to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the Bureau's conclusions could affect the termination of support for Republican senators.
In a Sunday poll, the co-director of the show "60 Minutes" asked the senator Scott Pelley of the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“I said I was going to the interview. I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came out and asked, "Did you do that?"
He was decisive, sure, and unambiguous."
Graham's voice seems like a rock.
“I am confident in my decision on Brett Kavanaugh, and that can only be changed in the bombing,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know how this happened, but I know Brett denied it vigorously,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And not everyone whom he has named was able to confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don't see anything new coming."
What is the global citizens' festival, and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, the annual music event will be organised by the New York Global Citizen Festival, which has a hugely impressive participation in celebrities and an equally impressive goal: to eliminate poverty from the world.
Now the seventh-time Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Lawn not only enjoying the kind of singers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the real goal of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. It is an international group of lawyers who hope to end poverty by constantly increasing the number of people fighting against it.
To get an event free of charge (unless you want to pay for the VIP ticket), concert guests had to perform a number of tasks or voluntary activities, send an e-mail to some world leader, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal of poverty eradication.
But how successful has Global Citizen been if there are 12 more years to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another click, where people feel that they are doing something important by signing a statement online or typing?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "activities" of its supporters, seeking to achieve a number of different objectives.
According to this, these measures have helped world leaders to inform them of more than $37 billion of commitments and policies affecting more than 2.25 billion lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and notifications resulting from their activities, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the UK-based partnership of investors and implementers in The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to "helping children to the full potential", with a commitment of 35 million dollars to help Rwanda to stop malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 hives from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, such as you, we can turn malnutrition into a historical footnote to social injustice,” said Ambassador Tracey Ullman of The Power of Nutrition to the crowd during the London concert in April 2018.
The group also informed that, following over 5,000 activities in the United Kingdom calling for improvements in mothers and children’s diet, the government announced a financing project called The Power of Nutrition, reaching 5 million women and children in need of nutrition intervention.
In response to one FAQ on its website, which asks, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “This is a long and difficult road — sometimes we fail and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-parthide movements that stand before us, we are sure of our success, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weekly, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are just a couple of performers who will be attending this year's event in New York, run by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use a Navy "block" to prevent Russia's energy exports - Minister of the Interior
According to Washington Examer, Washington may use its Navy, if necessary, to avoid hitting the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, has been published by US Home Minister Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia's participation in Syria, especially if it acts at the request of a legitimate government, was a pretext for the investigation of new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to concentrate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the stomach of southern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means of solving this.
“The United States of America has the opportunity to ensure, with the help of our Navy, that shipping lines are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not enter the market,” he added.
Zinke’s statement was turned over to participants in an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance.
He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they were essentially the same.
“The economic choice of Iran and Russia is more or less, and leverage and fuel replacement,” he said, while referring to Russia as “one trick pony” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump Government is responsible for increasing the export of LNG to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to reject the ‘unfit’ Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a ‘prisoner’ in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion USD Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s acute opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Alexander Novak, Russian Minister of Energy at the meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States has been set back by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI) called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a major problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industry Association (BDI), following a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that he was seriously considering running for president in the interim elections.
At the Holyoke Town Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed the consideration of his application.
“It is time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, and this includes the first lady,” said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I am seriously considering running for president."
Warren also assessed the activities of President Donald Trump at the Town Hall, saying that “he is taking the country in the wrong direction.
“I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has published a criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need the FBI before we vote."
However, the questionnaire published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own voters do not think that they should be running for 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk political research centre/Boston Globe, 58% of the “probable” massachusetts voters thought that the senator should not run.
32% supported such a application.
The poll showed more support for the former Governor's Deval Patrick nomination, 38% supported the possible nomination and 48% opposed it.
Other democratic names with a high profile, which were discussed in connection with a possible application for 2020, include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd officially decide by January, Associated Press announced.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin PTSD at Donald Trump's gathering
Track Palin (26) spent the year recruiting in Iraq in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and charged with assault.
“What my son is going through, what he will experience when he comes back, I can relate myself to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers return,” he told the audience at Donald Trump’s gathering in Tulsa in Octaham.
Palin called for the arrest of his son “in the living room” and, in connection with his son and other war veterans, said that “they will come back a little differently, they will come back under quarantine, they will come back thinking whether there is enough respect for what soldiers and pilots and all other military personnel have given to the state.”
According to Dan Bennett, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday, and was accused of domestic violence against women, domestic violence in intervention and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness.
18 states and the Columbia region contesting the new asylum policy
Eighteen countries and the Columbia region support the legal challenge of a new US policy prohibiting asylum for victims who flee from gang or domestic violence.
The representatives of 18 countries and regions made a brief statement of their friends in Washington on Friday to support the challenger’s policy, reported NBC News.
The applicant’s full name, Grace v Sessions, was not published in August against the Union’s policy of civil liberties.
The woman said that her accomplice “and her violent gang members sons” abused her, but the US officials did not accept her asylum application on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
National lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries producing large numbers of US asylum seekers, including gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the decision of the Immigrants' Board of Appeal in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to submit an asylum application.
Karl Racine, District Attorney General of Columbia, stated in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is not in conformity with national, Union and international law for decades".
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be resolved in accordance with specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a requirement violates this principle," said a brief statement by the friends of the Court.
The lawyers also stated in a brief statement that the ban on the entry of immigrants is detrimental to the US economy, saying that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "to provide the necessary labour".
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration courts in June no longer to give asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
“An asylum application is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or political opinion,” said the sessions in their Communication of 11 June.
The purpose of the asylum was never to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day.
Entertainmental rescue operations in prayer, where deaths have doubled in the struggle to find survivors
The situation was increasingly threatening to the survivors.
“The situation is very tense,” said a 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fever with a small son in the evacuating center of the town of Palu.
“Every minute, new people arrive with an ambulance.
There's not enough clean water."
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed homes, sorting out things that were soaked and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals affected by the 7.5-magnetous earthquake were overloaded.
Some injured people, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and upper arm, were resting outside the Pau Army Hospital, where patients were still treated under field conditions for severe follow-up.
His tears filled his eyes when he recalled how a strong earthquake rocked his fifth - floor hotel room, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was forced against the wall in the ruins," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they're not in danger."
The U.S. Ambassador blames China for being "intruded with ads at the job"
A week after the publication of four-page advertising under the US daily news on the mutual benefit of US-China trade, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the Annex to the Des Moines Register, which was paid by China Daily, following China's accusation to intervene in the US Congress elections on 6 November, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene in the US elections marked what US officials described as a new stage in the Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war, where import tariffs are adjusted.
The Chinese countermeasures at the start of the tariff war were intended to catch exporters from states such as Iowa, as they supported the parties of the Republic of Trump, have been explained by Chinese and US experts.
The US Ambassador in China and the former Governor of Iowa, as well as the largest Chinese exporter of agricultural products, Terry Branstad, said that Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in the opinion article of the Des Moines Register on Sunday: “China has now doubled its harassment by publishing ads on the free press.”
“The Chinese government uses America’s precious freedom of expression and free press practice to disseminate its own propaganda by putting its paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, there are only limited votes in the streets of Beijing and there are no truly different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic direction of China, given that the media is firmly held by the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He added that one of the most prominent newspapers in China refused to publish his article, but he did not say which newspaper was involved.
Analysts warn that the Republicans will alienate women before the mid-term elections with Kavanaugh fiasko
While many Republicans are waiting and defending the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of several sexual attacks, analysts have warned that they will see a setback during the forthcoming interim elections, especially from women.
The feelings surrounding the situation have been in the ceiling, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Sciences at Maxwell School, at the University of Caracas, in his Saturday article The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute efforts in the FBI investigation are sufficient to calm down the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or November,” said the Senior Adviser of the Progressive Group MoveOn and National Representative Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters repeated their demonstration in the senate corridor, “November is coming!” because the Republicans who control the judges’ committees decided to move forward with Kavanaugh’s nomination, regardless of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, announced Mic.
“Democratic industriousness and internal conviction are beginning to be excluded from the schedule,” said the news site’s informal political analyst Stu Rothenberg.
“People say it's already high, it's true.
However, it may be higher, especially among female voters from the suburbs and younger voters aged 18-29, who often do not like and abstain from voting."
Even before Ford's public statement describing his claims about sexual assault on a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts predicted a setback as the Republicans moved forward with confirmation.
“It has become very confused for GOP,” said Michael Steele NBC News, former Chairman of the National Committee of Republics at the beginning of last week.
"This is not only about the Commission's vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be appointed, it is also about how the Republicans have handled it and how they have treated it," pointed Guy Cecil, head of the United States of America (a group that helps to select Democrats).
However, the Americans seem to be a little divided, believing in Ford and Kavanaugh, but a little more supporting the first.
YouGov's new survey showed that 41% of respondents believed Ford's testimony for sure or probably, while 35% said that they believed Kavanaugh for sure or likely.
In addition, 38% say that they think Kavanaugh has probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other charge against Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford confessed last week to the Senate Committee of Judges under oath that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him his genitals when they attended a party during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new internet that will put Google and Facebook in the chest.
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee launched a start-up company that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technology agent Inrupt is a company that builds Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solids allow users to choose where their data is stored and which people have been given access to the information.
In an exceptional interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made fun of the fact that Inrupt's goal was to "govern the world".
"We have to do this now," he said about the start-up company.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “personal online database” or POD.
It may include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music collection and other personal and competent tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which is all available in one browser and simultaneously.
Its personal online database is unique because it allows the user to choose who can access this information.
The company calls it ‘the granting of individual powers through data’.
According to the company's manager John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to bring sources, processes and relevant skills to help Solid make available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project under contract, and the voluntary coding community.
From this week onwards, technology developers worldwide can create their decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not talk to “Facebook and Google whether to introduce a complete change if all their business models are fully supported overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's aim is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of a new web created on the basis of Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even at the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee World Wide Web consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute will remain the founder and director.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next age of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Bath: The memorial of the clergyman who was crucified in World War I, Victoria, was opened
During World War I alone, the Church of England, who was crucified by Victoria, celebrated the 100th anniversary of its hometown.
Colonel Colonel Bernard Vann fought his honor on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Leaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper bullet, and he didn't know that he had received the highest honor of the British army.
His two grandsons opened a monument on Saturday at the Northamptonshire in Rushden.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be “genius symbolic” if the stone was opened exactly 100 years after Grandpa’s prized struggle.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin “through very thick fog-jams and bullet-guns bullets."
Later, he rushed to the attack line and carried it on with “the greatest gala” before he alone rushed to one machine gun and knocked three opponents unconscious.
Colonel Bath killed a German sniper on October 4, 1918, when the end of the war was only a little over a month.
Michael Bath (72) said that his grandfather’s activity was “nothing I know I can never repeat, but for which I always remain grateful.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Bath, placed a wreath after a parade led by Brentwood's band of young people.
Michael Vann said that he has “a great honor to participate in this parade” and added that “the presence and support of so many people shows that a true hero can be appreciated.”
The OCT fans were Bellator 206 to watch all night, but only saw Peppa in Pigs
Imagine you've been up all night looking at Bellator 206, but that's not the main event you're showing you.
The San Jose match contained 13 fights, including six key maps, and was shown in the UK on channel 5 live all night.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousas and Rory MacDonald prepared for each other’s breasts, the British viewers stayed in their mouths long ago because Peppa appeared on the screen.
Many of this was not thrilled, especially those who had remained awake until early hours to see this fight.
One of the fans described on Twitter the transition to children's comics as a "sick joke".
“This is the government’s regulation that the content was no longer suitable at 6:00 and they had to switch to the children’s programme,” explained Dave Schwartz, the senior Vice-President of Bellator on marketing and communication issues when the transfer was asked.
"Swine Peppa," yes.
The President of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they intend to work on their timetables in order to take greater account of the United Kingdom’s viewers in the future.
“When I think about replaying now, I think we can solve this problem in the future,” Coker said.
“But if it is there at 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, we cannot do it until our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was modified, there was a lot of text back and forth, and not all of it was friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical disturbance.
But it wasn't, it was a government rule.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
Instead of six fights, we show five - as we usually do - we tried to offer fans more, and we just passed over in time.
It's a stupid situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt underrated by sexuality
The Olympic winner, Tom Daley, says that he grew up feeling less valuable than others because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to make progress.
A 24-year-old young man said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "everybody's not like him."
By participating in Lauren Laverne Radio 4 on Desert Island Discs, he said he was talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
Being a parent also changed her attitude toward winning the Olympic Games, giving the feeling that it was no longer so important.
You'll get a regular long-term broadcaster Kirsty Young to take a few months off because of his illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley said that when he grew up, he felt less valuable than anyone else, because it wasn't socially acceptable when you liked boys and girls.
He said: “Until today, these feelings are that I am not worthy and feel different, giving me power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was worthy of anything, and he didn't disappoint anyone else when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic winner has become the leader of the highly valued LGBT campaign by using his appearance in the People's Community Games in Australia this year to turn to more countries for the decriminalisation of homosexuality.
He said he was talking about it because he was lucky to be able to live without consequences and want to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American film artist Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - “suppressed him as a surprise.”
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference has never been a problem.
“When you live so much when you were young” - he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - it was hard to find someone the same old who had experienced similar rises and plights.
A couple became parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his whole perspective has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning the gold medal,” he said.
“But you know, there are much more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after the diagnosis of a brain tumor.
Daley said that his father refused to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that “Dad, you can’t sit in the front row because you’re gone by then,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually stopped breathing and died, I finally admitted that he was not undefeated,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of the home crowd at the Olympic Games,” he said.
It also inspired his first selection of songs - Heather Small's Proud - which helped him prepare the Olympic Games and still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of the form, Mickelson was removed from the game on Saturday at the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must improve his form to avoid the unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays record 12 times every two years at the event, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's match and four-ball.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner divided his day into two, being an incentive and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct batter, even at the peak of his career, is not suitable for 48-year-olds especially to play in a narrow Le Golf National golf course, where a long hard track punishes constantly lost hits.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will be facing the exact French Open champion Francesco Molinar on Sunday, who has joined forces with beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four races this week.
If the Americans, at the beginning of 12 single games with four points behind, start hot, the Mickelson competition may be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he didn't have much else to add.
"He fully understood his part of today, patted me on the shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder, and said that he would be ready by tomorrow," Furyk added.
“He is very confident.
He's a celebrity, and he's given so much to our teams in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't see him play two games.
I saw more, but that's how it went, and we had to choose a path like this.
He wants to be out like everyone else."
Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record on Sunday as the most participating player in Ryder Cup games.
It may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never answered his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence has given the team an additional spiritual contribution.
“He’s funny, ridiculed, funny, he likes to have fun with people, and he’s just great in the crew room,” he explained.
“I think that younger players had a lot of fun going against him this week and it was nice to see it.
He offers much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great success will soon be lost
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that Ryder Cup's last day's great leadership at the beginning of single games can easily become an unpleasant experience.
At the 1997 competition in Valderram, the Dane stood out in front of the Americans with Captain Seve Ballesteros, but when it reached the finish line, it was dramatically reduced, winning only with result 141⁄2 : 131⁄2.
“You even remember that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we also had great success in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, this victory came very close,” said Bjorn in the picture after the class of 2018 victory 5 : 3 Friday and yesterday’s success 10 : 6 Le Golf Nationals.
So history shows me and the entire team that it can happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points.
We have a goal that is to win the cup, and so let us focus on it.
I've always said I'm focused on 12 players who are on our side, but we're very aware of who is our opponents - the best players in the world."
Satisfying with the way his players have played in this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I will not rush ahead.
Tomorrow there will be completely new obstacles.
Tomorrow, personal performances will be considered, and so it will be something else.
It's nice to be with the opponent when things go well, but if you're there personally, you'll be tested in full as a golfer.
This is the message you have to pass on to the players - give me the best you can tomorrow.
Now that you're leaving your partner, he has to go and do it himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes that his players will work better in person than with the opponents, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three points.
Furyk himself has experienced both in these last days, being part of Brookline's victory team, before becoming part of the loss, when Europe defeated Medinah's miracle.
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question of how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put everything in their game on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you must start hot, like Brookline and like Medinahi.
When the momentum goes in one direction, it puts great pressure on the average competitions.
Let's set our team up accordingly and put the boys on the field in a way that we feel that a miracle can happen tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to run the race, and he's the best of the best with Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the best Europeans in the competition.
“I put my boys in a row like this because I think that's how we're covered,” Bjorn said about the choice of single games.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The latest German Navy high-speed sailboat should have come into operation in 2014, replacing old warships during the Cold War, but this will not happen before next year due to defective systems and increased costs as a snowball, announced by the local media.
The launch of the new ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ high-speed sailboat in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 in accordance with the military press release published in Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy already in 2014, but worrying post-transfer problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
Four of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are replaced by the old Bremen Class fast sailboats.
It is understandable that they have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some cloaking technologies such as radar, infrared and audible signals.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest high-speed sailboats should be able to leave the port for up to two years.
Continuous delays, however, mean that top-level warships - which allow Germany to strengthen power abroad - are getting older by the time they enter the service.
A failed F125 fast sailer appeared in the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipbuilder since it was received.
The reasons for the return were little known, but the German media quoted a number of important "software and hardware deficiencies" that made the warship unusable if they had been used in the fight mission.
The software shortages were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are managed by a team of about 120 sailors - only half of the workforce of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the maritime capacity to include future innovations.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is probably twice as heavy as the class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price of the entire project will become a problem, including training of the team.
It has been said that it amounts to EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest high-speed sailboats are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German Navy's capacity will decrease.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the German Parliament’s Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy has actually ‘run out of ships capable of being deported’.
The official said that this issue had grown as a snowball over time, because old ships had been removed, but no substitute ships had come.
He regretted that none of the fast sails in Baden-Wuerttmberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust is investigating the secret life of bats
The purpose of a new study in the Scottish Mountains is to reveal how bats use the landscape to find their own food.
It is hoped that the results will give new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to guide future protective measures.
In the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross, the researchers of Scotland’s National Trust monitor traditional and sopranipiples, as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats.
Special recorders are placed in the main locations of the area to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers shall also carry out field studies using handheld sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings shall determine the frequency and species of the call of bats.
A map and report of habitats will then be created to create a detailed landscape image of their behaviour.
NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of management of habitats, such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other associated species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole, the population of bats has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect their habitats and their losses.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can flying papers and chemical treatment of some building materials, as well as attacks on pet cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because of their night hunting, their ears are more useful in catching prey than their eyes.
They use complex echo-location techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land, takes bats very seriously throughout the country.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, surveys, and sometimes save them.
The organisation has even created the first and only special reserve in Scotland in Three in Dumfrie and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland live.
Real estate manager David Thompson says this area is an ideal territory for them.
“We have a large area for bats in Three,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and a great place to live.
But there's a lot more to discover about bats, so the work we do here and in other areas will help us understand better what they need."
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before starting care activities on the property, as the unwanted destruction of one place of pregnancy and childbirth can kill up to 400 females and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and killing, disturbing or destroying them is illegal.
The Scottish officer, Elisabeth Ferrell, has encouraged the public to contribute.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our bats and we just don’t know many of our species and how their families feed.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers intend to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has rejected the rape charges against him as "the fake news", saying that people want to advertise themselves by using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the charges against the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The assailants of Portugal and Juventus have been accused of rapeing American woman Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He has allegedly paid the women EUR 330 643.10 not to talk about the incident, stated Der Spiegel on Friday.
When you turn to your 142 million trackers in the Instagram live video for hours after the charges, Ronaldo (33) announced that they were fake news.
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What we're talking about today is the wrong news," said five times the winner of Ballon d'Or.
They want to use my name to promote themselves.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for "unauthorized suspicion of privacy".
Advocacy Christian Schertz said that the player is seeking compensation for “the moral damage that corresponds to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite in Palms Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's hotel room where he was allegedly raped, according to the Clark County District Court, on the basis of documents submitted in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was a “99 percent good man” of whom “one percent fails”.
The papers say Ronaldo confirmed a couple of sexual relations, but it was not unanimous.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was afraid of "prepayments" and was concerned about "public humiliation".
Now the 34-year-old woman says that she is now trying to reject the solution, as the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Italy in connection with a huge operation of EUR 100 million in Juve.
Brexit: The United Nations can begin to regret car manufacturers leaving forever
The United Kingdom “two forever” if it lost its position as the world’s car industry leader after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that the Toyota United Nations had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop their production at a factory located near Derby in Burnaston.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of border crossing stops without the Brexit agreement could be paid for.
The Burnastonian factory, which manufactures vehicles in Toyota Auri and Avens, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that, when Britain starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we will see a stop to the production process in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Burnaston Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers have also feared leaving the EU without an agreement, with concerns about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says he's gonna shut down the Mini factory in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to supply chain risks in the absence of a Brexit agreement.
The Toyota production line operates as necessary, where spare parts come from both the United Kingdom and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement of 29 March, there may be a disturbance at the border which, according to industry, may cause delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota would not be able to store more than a day's supply at his Derbyshire factory, so production must be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May Chequers' plan for future EU relations has been "exactly calibrated to avoid such border controls."
“We need an agreement. We want the best solution that will enable what we want, and not only to make use of the current success, but also to take advantage of the whole opportunity,” he said to BBC Radio 4 today.
"The evidence not only of Toyota but also of other producers shows that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be suspended, but in the long term it warned that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalari, a representative of the Unite trade union who worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “We know from our own experience that when jobs disappear, they will not return.
The government spokesperson said: "We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may delay again, says White House
The meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein with the major contributions of Donald Trump may be postponed for another week, as the fight against the highest candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, announced the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein will monitor the work of Special Commissioner Robert Mueller, who will investigate the intervention of the Russian elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether Trump is firing the D.A.'s assistant and thereby jeopardising Mueller's independence has been triggering Washington rumors for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times announced that Rosenstein was discussing the use of eavesdropping tools to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the President through Amendment 25.
Rosenstein didn't confirm it.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, saying he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, who was then in New York with the United Nations.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence with the hearing of the Senate Committee of Judges, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both gave a lesson.
On Friday, Trump commissioned a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's spokesperson, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday in Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may take another week to postpone it, taking into account all matters relating to the Supreme Court.
But let's take a look at it and keep the press up to date, as always."
Some journalists would challenge this argument: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
The director, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of information lessons was not due to the deliberate disappointment of TV journalists, although he added: “I do not object to the fact that they have been disappointed.”
He then recommended direct contact between Trump and the press.
The President will do more questions and answers than any president before him," he said, without adding any evidence: "We have looked at these numbers."
The briefings continue, Sanders confirmed, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly from the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this a lot, and you've seen how we've done it in the last few weeks, so it's going to happen during the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, before attending the gathered journalists, he was on the loose and sometimes in a strange way.
The Minister of Health wrote to EU employees in NHS Scotland regarding Brexit’s fears
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in NHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish to be present after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent his letter if the United Kingdom has less than six months left before leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of established status for EU citizens working in its public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “In the summer negotiations have continued on the withdrawal between the United Kingdom and the EU, heading towards the expected decisions of this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also made preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
Professionals from all over the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie passed the emergency surgery after the head trauma
Tennessee State Tigers supporter Christion Abercrombie passed an extraordinary operation after the main injury and defeat on Saturday 31 : 27 Vanderbilt from Commodores, published by Tennessee Mike Organ.
The chief coach at Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the injury happened just before the halftime.
“He fell on his side and just collapsed,” said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side before being placed on the stretcher for further examination.
Tennessee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that the Abercrombie operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are no details of the type/range of injury yet, and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year student with a red shirt, was in Tennessee State in her first season after the transfer from Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before he left the game, making up 18 fights this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher temple tax if they buy real estate in the United Kingdom, using this additional money to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
This step will undermine Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters.
Tax on stamps is levied on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will create up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher temple tax rate if they buy real estate in the United Kingdom using this additional money to help homeless people, Theresa announced today.
The movement is considered to be an attempt to render harmless Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to offer them affordable housing and to target people with high incomes.
The stamp duty will tax individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom by channelling additional money to the government's desire to fight homelessness.
The premium - which is in addition to the current temple tax, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on the second home and on the purchase of leases - may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this movement will generate up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the property purchased in London belongs to non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get their feet down when purchasing housing.
Many of the wealthy regions of the country, especially in the capital city, have become "incarnation cities" thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy will come only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the temple tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high when they buy land but do not use it, and invited May to give up affordable home quotas in order to improve Britain's "housing shame".
Corbyn has announced the reform of an eye-catching housing economy, including rent control and the cessation of the harassment of innocent people.
It also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new homes.
May said: “I promised last year that as Prime Minister I would commit myself to restoring British dream — that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live, work and build their own lives here.
At the same time, it is right for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for companies abroad, to be as easy to buy homes as the hard-working British people.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has become too far away, and harsh sleeping conditions are a normal reality."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is the management of Scotland"
The leader of Sunderlan, Jack Ross, says that his "final goal" is to become the leader of Scotland at some point.
The Scottish (42) welcomes the challenge of revitalizing the North-East club, which is currently in third place in League One, with only 3 points behind.
He moved to the stadium this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Champions League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to class B, and that's what it was all about," said Ross to the BBC Scotland show Sportsound.
“But I grew up with my father looking at the Scottish in Hampden, and it’s always something that has pulled me back.
But this option comes only when I'm successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors under Sunderland have been Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic leader says that he did not feel afraid of such great and well-known names, having previously endured both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"It's a success for me right now if I can take this club to the Champions League."
Because of its structure and facilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the Champions League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I can only see myself successful if I manage to get the club back there."
Ross has worked as a leader for only three years, being former Deputy Director of Dumbarton and 15 months among Hearts' senior staff.
Then he helped Allao recover from the third level and turned St Mirren's lowest position into the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he's more comfortable now than he was in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic during his career.
“It was a real crossroads,” he recalled.
“I truly believed that driving was more appropriate for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did it, got a reasonable income, and enjoyed a few peak moments.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things to be done every week.
I still experience this in view of the tension and pressure of my work, but the management just seems better.
I've always wanted to drive, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable now than ever before when I was a grown-up."

According to the study, the best time for the surface is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat has improved the turnover of British pubs, but more pressure has been placed on restaurant chains.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, but that of restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a representative of CGA, who compiled these figures: “The continued participation of sunshine and England in world championships meant that July was similar to June when pub turnover increased by 2.8 per cent, except for the fact that restaurants were even more difficult.
In June 1.8% of the trade in reduced restaurants deteriorated further in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars were the most successful in trading and trying to like restaurants the worst.
Food - based pubs also suffered despite the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant managers.
It looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, while sales of food fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, an analyst for leisure and hospitality, said: “These results continue to follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factor when it comes to selling outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to fight, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to last year is particularly painful in addition to the ongoing price pressure.
Long and hot summers could not have come at a bad time for food businesses and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August provide some of the necessary relief."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of trade mark agencies.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
The study concluded that one child in five, some in 11 years of age, has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 gymnasts found growth in the “Valted Insta” pages
The news heightened the fear of posting sexual content
Twenty per cent of the students said they had a "basic account" to show parents
The study concluded that one child in five, some only 11 years old, creates secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 upper secondarys found a marked increase in the “Valts Insta” accounts (reference to the image sharing page Instagram).
The news heightened the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty per cent of the students said they had a “basic account” for showing parents as well as for themselves.
One of his 13-year-old daughter's secret pages found that the teenager invited others to rape.
Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18 year-olds had two profiles, and half of them recognised the existence of personal accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing to see so many teenagers being tempted to create accounts online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilith Doyle will be a sportsman on the board of Scottish Athletics.
At the annual meeting of the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors, Eilith Doyle was elected as a non-executive manager.
Doyle is one of Scotland's most unscrupulous lightweights, and Chairman Ian Beattie described what happened as a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience in the last decade.
“Elidh is respected everywhere in Scotland, the United Nations and elsewhere in sports communities, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will reap the benefits of inviting his management,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I wish to be the spokesperson of athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution to Scotland’s sport and contribute to its development.”
An American who won four olympics at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games at 200 metres and 400 metres, and now often shares his views in BBC, was unable to walk after a transient Islamic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said whether or not I'm going to recover and, if so, to what extent, only time will show.
I've been working hard, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and I'm already doing speed training!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertising, which compares women to cows, divides the Internet into two
The breast pump company has shared the internet with two camps of advertising that compares breastfeeding mothers with milking cows.
According to reports, in order to celebrate the presentation of the “the world’s first silent breast pump”, the consumer-oriented technology company Elvis’s ironic music video published a similar ad in order to present the freedom that this new pump gives to the mothers who want to live.
Four true mothers dance at a table filled with hay and sing, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see my tail" and, "If you didn't notice, these aren't the udders, these are my breasts."
Repeats verse: "Pump, pump, feed children, pump, pump, fill my ladies with milk."
However, advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has led to conflicting opinions on the Internet.
Seventy-seven thousand-fold video viewers disagree, many of them say it illuminates the back of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to promote this product was a very poor decision.
As we do, they must become pregnant and give birth to milk, but the difference is that children are stolen from them on the countless days after birth," wrote one.
Elvie breast pump does not puncture from breast-feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentator said: “It is understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use these children to promote the breast pump of the mothers who are being held?"
Someone added, "Advertisingly unnoticed ad."
Some of them are in favour of ads, and one of the women thought it was super fun.
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy myself one if I were still breast-feeding.
Pumping milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but let's do it the way it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
The second commented: “It’s fun for mothers who pump and feel like cows (often in their jobs or in their bathrooms).
This advertising does not praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they've all been dancing in bras with non-eyed pumps.
The idea of a campaign is based on the fact that many breast - pumping women feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is completely quiet, no wires or pipes and does not look like a breastfed, giving women freedom to move, to keep children and even to walk outside during pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserved a bold and annoying introduction.
Compared with women's opportunities for expression and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while presenting in a fun and familiar key the extraordinary smell of freedom created by the new pump.
This isn't the first time the news has reflected Elvis's pump.
In London’s fashion week, two children’s mother, bearing the product of designer Marta Jakubowski, appeared on the scene.
Thousands of migrant children quietly went to a tent camp at the Texas border.
The number of children arrested has risen sharply, although the monthly border crossings have remained quite the same. Partly because the harsh rhetoric and politics enforced by the Trump administrator has made it difficult with the help of the children's founding sponsors.
Most of the sponsors are document-based immigrants and have been afraid of violating the possibility of staying in their country, so the child's right to care is required.
The risk increased in June when national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other household adults could provide fingerprints and data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, senior management official for immigration and customs management, last week admitted to Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for financial support for non-contributive minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80 per cent of sponsors or sponsors' household members are illegally present in the country and a large number of them have criminal backgrounds.
So let's continue tracking them," said Mr. Albence.
In order to deal with children more quickly, officials enforced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of the arrest.
Many defend their legal content by videoconferencing in front of the immigration judge.
Unreleasable persons are quickly deported from the country.
According to asylum workers and based on the reports of the system published in recent months - the longer the child is in custody, the more likely they become nervous or depressed, which can cause violent demonstrations or attempts to escape.
According to lawyers, these concerns are more topical in large detention facilities, such as the Tornillo, where the child’s difficulties can be missed by size.
They added that moving children to a tent town without leaving sufficient time to get used to feelings or to say goodbye to friends could cause a trauma that many are already in trouble with.
Syria demands immediate departure of the US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to come home at the UN General Assembly, even though the country has been at war for the eighth year.
Moualemi, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally on the grounds of counter-terrorism on Syrian soil and are being dealt with accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally, he said in the Assembly.
More than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight "in this holiday war until we have cleaned up the entire Syrian territory" both from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign force."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and consulting both the Kurdish units and the Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In France, there are more than 1,000 troops in a war - torn country.
Speaking on the subject of refugees of war, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were appropriate and he accused some of the Western nations of senseless fears that prevented the arrival of refugees.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them look after them,” he said.
"They're politicizing something that's just a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive recovery aid until there is an end to the war between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which will create the last insurgent base in the Idlib buffer zone, has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented the widespread attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province of three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the treaty had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would hit the jihadists, including Nusra Front, associated with Al-Qaida, who would be "killed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura looks forward to persuading a new committee of members of the government and opposition to design the post-war Syrian Constitution and pave the way for the election.
Moualem made requests for the Syrian Government to participate in the Committee, saying that the work of the panel could be limited to reviewing the current Articles of the Constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump is elected for the second term of office
According to this logic, Trump could win in the next elections in 2020 if his office and scandal have not been completed before, as the liberal viewers probably want.
Which would undoubtedly be “the most exciting end of the Presidential Office!"
Currently, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-hour ratings have doubled to over 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers. Compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, their number has increased. MSNBC shows The Rachel Maddow Show, 3.5 million viewers have kept its rating high during the main evening news.
“This is the tension we are involved in, because we do not understand it,” said the director of the ABC drama “Designed Survivor” about the Secretary of State, who will become president if the attack destroys Parliament’s building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, is another theory.
He remembers the pre-selection taxi ride in Boston.
The driver told him he'd vote in favour of Mr Trump.
"Why?" he asked
“He said he made me laugh,” said Mrs Scovell to me.
All this chaos has an entertaining value.
Of course, not as other TV shows, Washington rumors can be fatal to the future of Roe v. Wade and to the desire to reunite immigrant families and the global economy.
Avoiding the subject is only the luxury of the viewers.
However, the six-hour talk show of Bob Woodward's "based background study" for his book "Fear" and Paul Manafort's 13 225,73€ ossified ostrich jacket (Washington Post said about it in a "too confident clothing") and Stormy Daniels' ulterior thoughts about Mr Trump's anatomy magic, is more than an educated citizen.
For example, I never look at Super Mario again with the same feeling.
“One of his activities, which may seem like a reality show, is that he shares something every night,” said the CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the series “The Pandicians” Brent Montgomery Trump performance with changing actors and day-to-day plans (over-noding with NFL, Kim Jong-uni praise).
You can't miss a single part or you're out of your mind.
This week, Fleiss's house was 80 degrees warm on the north shore of Kauai, but he was in a room to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to give up watching Brett Kavanaugh deal with the Senate's Legal Committee and how the fate of the Supreme Court hangs on the hair.
“I remember how in our time we made all kinds of crazy shows, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money flows elsewhere move to the greatest white house in the world.
It is no wonder that division 17 of Pennsylvania receives a cash flow thanks to the restructuring of the Congressional Area, receiving two dominant undertakings in the same place.
As a result, Conor Lamb, who won the second district in the emergency elections last spring, was re-elected in the suburbs of Pittsburgh.
The Lamb's opponent is Keith Rothfus, a Republican who currently represents the 12th division of Pennsylvania, which in the larger section coincides with the new 17.
The maps were changed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling in January, which is why the old districts were divided into Constitutional electoral regions, favouring the Republics.
The new 17th election has been launched by a campaign where the financial departments of the largest political parties - the Democratics' Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Committee for the Republican campaign (NRCC) are overrun by money.
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a shortage of victory much viewed in the March 18th Congressional district of Pennsylvania in extraordinary elections.
This place has been won by a Republican for decades, and President Donald Trump won by 20 points in Division.
Political speakers have given the Democrats a small advantage.
United States El Salvador was punished for supporting China and then withdrawn
Diplomatics noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama already acknowledged Beijing, a small setback to Washington.
Mr Trump met Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in June 2017 in a friendly atmosphere and owned the Panama hotel until the partners expelled the management team of Trump's company.
The Foreign Ministry officials decided to recall American leaders from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama, as the Ministry’s press officer Heather Nauert said earlier this month that these countries had recently stopped supporting Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador, which received USD 140 million from America in 2017, including for drug surveillance, development and economic stimuli, was intended to be punished.
The recommended sanctions, including reductions in financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment rate and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity to organise a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, seen as a development in their efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials explained that they wanted to continue the consultation and conclude the debate on any sanctions in El Salvador.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pence is now being criticised, who will speak at a meeting in mid-October to discuss the government's views.
And three American ambassadors secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh reports or punishments in Washington.
The White House spokesperson, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of what three American officials had said, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss national debates on the request to remain anonymous.
Their discussions were confirmed by an analyst close to the government who also spoke on an anonymous request.
Learning History
Next, the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller will publish a report on Trump's possible justice, for which there is a lot of evidence in the state archive.
Mueller is also allegedly investigating in his study whether Trump's campaign is linked to Russia's attack on our elections.
If Congress were to change the party, Trump would have to report in this institution as if he were going again to talk to the voters and perhaps even to the judges of his peers.
There are many butts here, and I do not want to point out that the withdrawal of Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which affects the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler if only the West had prevented him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of slaughter.
History moves around such points of turn, and democracy's unloved march is closer or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in boiling water since it was announced that last year he proposed the president's secret recording and was speculating that position about his malpractice.
Rosenstein says The Times's statement is inaccurate.
“How to react if the newly requested FBI-related Brett Kavanaugh investigation is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonesty?
And above all, do we vote in favour of Congress in the middle elections if Trump is to be responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy will take a long winter vacation.
But I believe we will not fail because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over and used our ambassador's home.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me a Sabbath candle light on a table with a hammer.
With such an inheritance, how should I not be optimistic about our future?"

The Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the Rapid Vienna battle
The Rangers will organise Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Australia, which followed the impressive tie against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to become the European League of G.
Knee injury did not allow the Central Player Graham Dorrans to show up for the first season before 2: 2 pin-end game against Villarreal, but believes that Rangers can use this result as a jumping table for better results.
“It was a good point for us, because Villarreal has a strong opponent,” said a 31-year-old player.
“We went to the game, believing that we could achieve something and left the game with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but it was generally a fair result.
They were better in the first half of the game and we were better in the second half.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
I hope we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they got a good score in their last game, but since the people support us, I'm sure we can get together and get a good score.
Last year was difficult, because of this, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all have a good feeling of insight.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can move on now, leave behind last season and be successful."
Women cannot sleep due to fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that the interviewers had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the subjects in the Nationwide survey said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they'd talked to their children about it.
“People want family members to take care of them, but at the same time they don’t talk about it,” explained Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Nationalwide’s life insurance policy.
This, however, should be started.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family for care unless they know your wishes in advance.
Work with your adviser and family by discussing where and how to get care, as these options may be extremely important in terms of costs.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan of how to pay for these expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term insurance policy, hybrid life insurance policy with monetary value to help cover these costs, or property self-insurance - as long as you have the necessary money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles already in the bud.
Get yourself a health care authorisation to identify a trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes at any time if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the trustee in relation to your financing.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid even if you are incapable.
Do not forget small details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write these things down so you can be ready if you have to.
"This is not only a financial side, but it is also important who would be doctors?" explained Martin.
“What medicines are needed?
Who takes care of the dog?
Set it all up."
Ilfracombe was shot several times from a sniper's head with an air gun.
He was shot several times in an air gun after he was on his way home after a night out.
In the '40s, the victim was shot in Ilfracombe, Oxford Grove, in Devon, in the chest, stomach, and hand.
The police described the shooting at night at about 02:30 as a random act.
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are asking all Witnesses to contact him.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pau on Friday, the officials reported that the number of deaths was still increasing.
Since the communication has broken, the rescuers have not received any information from the Donggala Regent north of the request, which is close to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnetous earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
The following are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawes:
The request is the capital of the province of Central Sulawes, which is located on the west coast of the island of Sulawes, and the population was estimated at 379 800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was suddenly hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
The Donggala Regent is an area extending more than 300 km (180 km) in the north-western part of the island of Sulawes.
The Regent, which is an administrative area under the province, was estimated to have 299 200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the Central Sulawes province, in particular the Donggala coastal area.
In the province, it is also important to mine nickel, which is mainly concentrated on the opposite coast of Morowal, Sulawes.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Relief Agency, the tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people in Dongala and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, the tsunami hit the western part of Donggala, killing nine.
Indonesia is seismically in the Pacific Circle of Fires and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
The following are the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh, Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226 000 people on the Indian coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In March and early April, several strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8-degree earthquake hit Indonesia's most populated south of Java Island, creating a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The area near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra, was hit by an earthquake of 7.6 degrees.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: The 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the Sumatra Islands - the island of Mentawai, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regent in Aceh, sowing destruction and panic, reminding people of the death of the earthquake in 2004 and the destruction that tsunami has brought.
There was no tsunami at that time, but more than 100 people were killed in failed buildings.
2018: The major earthquakes hit Lombok in the Indonesian tourist island, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in distress.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges
The oldest son of Track Palin, former Governor of Alaska and Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report published by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, in connection with suspicions of domestic violence, interference with and opposition to domestic violence.
According to the police report, when a female person tried to report the alleged crimes, Palin took the phone from him.
Palin is held at the Mat-Su Pre-Study Office and is held against an unsolicited bail of $500, reported KUTU.
He appeared in court on Saturday when he declared that he was “not guilty in any way,” announced the news network.
Palin is facing three A-class misdemeanors, which means he can be expected to face a year of imprisonment and a fine of $250 000.
He has also been charged with a B-class misdemeanor, punishable by a one-day imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
Regarding the alleged attack, his mother, Sarah Palin, was called by the police.
The case is currently being discussed by the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of attack at home, interference with the report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon, all in a state of drunkenness.
His friend said he hit him in the face.
The veteran groups criticised Sarah Palin in 2016 when she linked her son to PTSD, which is the result of her service in Iraq.
The Indonesian earthquake was followed by a tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died since the earthquake on Friday on the island of Sulawes, Indonesia.
The 7.5-degree earthquake triggered the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of people killed is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake hit the outskirts of the city center of Sulawes, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
The social media broadcasts videos showing the moment of an earthquake.
At the time of the capture of tsunami, hundreds of people had gathered at the festival on the shore of the town of Palu.
Federal prosecutors in NYC are seeking a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are applying for the death penalty against Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack on eight people in New York, and this rare punishment has not been committed for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used Home Depot's rental car to attack bicycles along the West Side highways in Lower Manhattan, with pedestrians and cyclists on their way in October.
According to the request for a death penalty in the southern region of New York, prosecutors are required to prove, in order to justify the death penalty, that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and also caused serious injuries on purpose.
Both cases constitute a possible death penalty on the basis of the case-files.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury made a 22-point charge to Saipov, which included eight murder charges involving extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised criminal offences, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “several planning and premeditation,” said the prosecutors, describing Saipov’s activities as “serious, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’s family and friends,” he said.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the last death of the Southern District Court of New York.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in 1953 in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, when the couple were executed after the conviction in a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an ancient worm, showed a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack, according to the evidence of the case.
According to the police, he had told the detectives he was pleased to see what he had done.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit an attack on ISIS videos from his phone.
According to the police, he also wanted an ISIS ticket exhibited in his hospital palace.
In a 22-point charge, he hasn't taken the blame.
David Patton, a national defender of Saipov, said that they were "obviously disappointed" in the procedural decision.
"In our view, the decision to apply for the death penalty increases the trauma of all the people involved, rather than the possible release of life," said Patton.
Previously, Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutors not to file a death penalty.
Mr Tory said that Mr FARAGE should be appointed to lead the Brexit negotiations.
During the protest of the Tory Conference today, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the People's Army".
Former UKIP leader said that politicians had to feel "hot" by Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians recommended that she lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a conservative member of the Lower House, said on Mars in Birmingham that the UK would “be out by now” if Mr Farage were the secretary of Brexit.
But Mrs. May is facing the problem of reconciliating her deeply divided lines, which were emphasised by the conservatives in favour of staying, joining the city in their protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is in trouble keeping his Chequers plan on track in the midst of Brexit supporters, icers and EU attacks.
The Allies called for it to continue its trade with Brussels, despite its counterattack, and for the Eurosceptics and Liberals to choose between their own package and their "coastal".
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted to "let Chequers' plan go".
He recommended taking Farage as a partner and giving him responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
'It's his responsibility that we should be out by now,' he said.
Member of the European Parliament Wellingborough added: "I stand outside for Brexit, but we must abandon Chequers' plan."
In reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be in subjection.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that the public opinion has now changed since the 2016 vote: "The belief that the British people have changed their minds and wish to remain is not true."
Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Tory Brexit, was also on the march and told the reporters: “I say only one thing: Prime Minister, listen to people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and among our activists who actually walk the streets and choose us at all.
Please leave Chequers' plan and start listening."
With a message aimed at Mayle, he added: "The prime ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises."
Farage said that the politicians who attended the meeting must be "warmed" when they plan to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class" he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that "we're not gonna let that happen."
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to put our political class on the verge of Brexit in an uncomfortable way.
“We will mobilize the national army that gave us victory over Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, municipal, proud Britain.”
At the same time, the remnant marched through Birmingham before the two - hour gathering in the center of the city.
A handful of activists were waving "The Tories Against Brexit" slogans after the group was established this weekend.
Lord Adonis of Liberals mocked the Conservatives because of the security issues that became a part of their party's application in opening the conference.
“These are people who say that IT systems can be put in place and all the technology can be transferred to Canada and, more importantly, to smooth border crossings, to cross-border trading in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
According to Elizabeth Warren, U.S.A., she is seriously considering running for president after the November elections.
Boston Globe announces that the Democrat of Massachusetts spoke about his future on Saturday at the West Massachusetts Town Hall.
Warren, the frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will stand against Geoff Diehl, the National Representative of GOP in November in the next elections, who was Vice-President of the Massachusetts campaign of Trump in 2016.
They're speculating that he could be against Trump by 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the voters in the Town Hall after Trump took office.
The defendant asked if he was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that “it is time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, that is to say, also in the vanguard”.
There was an arrest for shooting LSU Sims.
L.A. Police Baton Rouge reported on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who took place on Friday, has been arrested.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson's arrest around 11:00 in the morning at the ET News Conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify the man on the frames.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University in the early morning of Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died behind it,” said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday through 247sport.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and got shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being on the scene, having a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and arrested at East Baton Rouge Police Station.
The young man Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, 10 of them in their original composition, an average of 17.4 minutes, throwing 5.6 points and taking 2.9 tableballs per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after the team account gave him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment on, it became clear that Valtteri Bottas was qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the order of the Mercedes team played a major role in the race.
Bottas began well and left Hamilton almost neglected when he first defended his position and invited Vettelli to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the box stops and left Hamilton’s group behind in tight traffic, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the box stop later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went to lead after being next to him, when the Ferrari leader reluctantly left the inner side free after the attempt to protect it with double movement on the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the competition from the rear row of the grid and was seventh in his 21st birthday at the end of the first round.
He then ran the race for most of the time, driving to the finale of the rubbers and passed Kim's Räikkönen, taking fourth place.
He finally went to the box stop on the 44th round, but he failed to increase the speed of the last eight rounds, which gave Räikkönen the fourth place.
Today is a difficult day because Valtter did a good job all week and was a real gentleman passing me by.
“The crew has done an excellent job to have one of the two,” said Hamilton.
It was a very poor body language.
President Donald Trump at Senator Diane Feinstein's meeting on Saturday because of the incident that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
When speaking at the meeting in West Virginia, the President did not address Mr Ford's testimony directly before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, but instead commented on what is happening in the Senate at the moment, which shows that people are "bad, disgusting and lying".
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and is happening in the Senate in a few days is that you see angry and angry, mean, disgusting and lying people,” he said.
“Looking at the press releases and the leaks on which it is said: ‘ Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question, ‘ Did you leak the document? ’ — Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he added with the look of a senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter of charges against Kavanaugh in July and was leaked at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his workplace.
The Hill stated: “I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations or leak his story,” said Feinstein to the Committee.
“He asked me to keep confidentiality, and I did so according to his request.”
However, his denial did not suit the president, who commented during the meeting on Saturday: “You know what, it was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't, but it's one of the worst body languages I've ever seen."
In continuing to protect the Supreme Court candidate for the sexual abuse of three women, the President pointed out that the Democrats were using these charges for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power without choosing resources.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to run over to gain power and control of themselves," the President of the Media told.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 : 3 Belfast Giants
Gians Patrick Dwyer created two gates against Dundee.
Dundee Stars won the Elite League on Saturday at the re-election of Belfast Giants, who lost to Dundee 5 : 3.
Giants took the lead early in the game at two gates from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team tie before Dwyer took the Giants back to lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized Dundee's condition before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's gates secured their victory.
It was the third loss for Adam Keefe's men in the elite league, and they came to Belfast on Friday night to win Dundeed as 2 : 1.
This was the fourth meeting of the parties of the season, of which Giants won the previous three games.
The opening gate of Dwyer came at 3:35 a.m. with the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford when Beauvilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
Sullivan brought the home team back in the first third of 13:10 before Matt Marquardti helped Cownie hit the pingate at 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer made sure that Giants would lead before the first break, hitting his second gate at the end of the first third.
At home, the players reassembled and Bouchard put them back to the level, beating the numerically dominant minute at 27:37 the gate.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee first lead at the end of the second third of the game, securing the third victory in his team's attack zone.
Giants, who has now lost four of the last five games, will meet with Milton Keynes at home in the next game.
The pilot dies to save hundreds of people from an earthquake.
One Indonesian air traffic controller was declared to be a hero after he gave his life to ensure that hundreds of planes carrying people would take off safely.
The great earthquake that struck the island of Sulawes on Friday caused the tsunami, after which more than 800 people were killed, many of whom have not been known to have disappeared.
The region is trapped by strong afterlifes and many people are trapped under ruins in the town of Palu.
Despite the fact that 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled the fluctuating flight tower at Phu Mutira Sis Al Jufri airport, he refused to leave.
He remained on the job to ensure safe take-off of Batik Air flight No 6321, which was on the same route.
Then he jumped out of the tower, thinking it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirai, a media representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, confirmed that his decision could save hundreds of lives, reported Australian ABC News.
We've set up a helicopter to transport him from Kalimantan Balikpapan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before he got to Prussian.
“We were extremely sad when we heard about it,” added a spokesperson.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could increase to thousands. According to the state disaster relief agency, access to the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong was restricted.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a press officer of the agency, said: “The number of deaths can increase, because the bodies of many victims are still in ruins and have not been saved.”
The six-metre waves destroyed the town of Põu, where mass destruction takes place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
A 35 - year - old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “The emergency room provides new sacrifices every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we cannot tell them what they can find there.
It is already a tragedy, but the situation may get even worse."
Indonesia’s President, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palus on Sunday and said to the state’s army: “Please work nights and days to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready for this?" reported CNN.
At the beginning of this year, the Indonesian city of Lombok suffered an earthquake where more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesia Aviation Accident: Air Niugin says one man is missing after the lagoon air accident
Although it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from a submerged plane, the airline now claims that one man was missing.
Air Niugini said in his statement that since Saturday afternoon they couldn't find one male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately reply to the passenger’s details, such as the questions of age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water when it landed at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the United States Navy said that the plane landed far from the lagoon route.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the route.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low when it landed.
“It’s very good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers were able to chain the sinking plane to the emergency exit in the water at the height of the belt.
He mentioned that the cabin crew was panicking and screaming and that he had a small head trauma.
The U.S. Navy and sailors working on a nearby pier also helped to save by using inflatable boats to take people to the shore before the plane sank about 20 feet [30 m].
The safety network data show that 111 people have died in aviation accidents involving air carriers registered to PNG in the last two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
Analyst sets a schedule for the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office closed the case on Saturday for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, spent several hours as an expert observer in the analysis of intelligence data.
He pointed out to the jury how he used cell phone records to re-create 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he received location information from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to the young man’s earlier claims.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, which is why the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford entered the courtroom on Saturday and admitted that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said that Tellis was "wrong because my car was in Nashville".
Another mismatch was that Tellis said she had known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The phone records showed that the women had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis erased Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from her life," said Hale.
The defense is planning to make a trial on Sunday.
The judge said he thought the case would go to jury hearings later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is aware of hiphop?
Hiphop Trio wants to fight negative genre definitions by adding positive messages to music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hiphop has gone away from its political messages and social problem-solving initiatives.
They want to go back to the roots of the hiphop and make the conscious hiphop popular again.
Bands like The Fugees and Commons have recently re-collected popularity in Britain thanks to bands like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
The New York nanny is suing for racist messages in a couple of courts.
The New York nanny is suing for discriminatory dismissal a couple of times after his family’s unwitting message, where his mother complained that the nanny was “serious black”.
A couple denys that they're racists compared to blackmail.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her resentment when she learned that their new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day in 2016.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband saying, "EIIIIIIIIIIII, ORGANISED MUSTANAHAL."
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, the uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman, after his pious understanding of Miss Maurice, had fired their social nanny, who was an African American, had done a bad job and had been waiting for a Filipino instead.
Miss Maurice was paid one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple of courts to get compensation for her dismissal, which she wants to receive on a daily basis in the amount of 350 dollars for the next six months, and the same work she was initially hired to do, but without a contract.
“I want to show them so that they can do it,” he said to The Post, adding, “I know it is discrimination.”
A couple have rejected the claim that they were racists, saying that it was reasonable to stop working with Maurice because they were afraid that after she was offended, they could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t mean.
He's not a racer.
“We are not racists,” said her husband Joel Plasco to The Post.
“But would you give your children to a person with whom you have been rude, even if it was involuntary?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Commenting on the comparison with blackmail, Plasco said that his wife was two months away from the birth of a child and was in a "very difficult situation".
“ Would you like to meet someone like that?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the case is still pending, the public opinion has quickly condemned a few in social media, where they are severely criticised for their behaviour and thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not be in contact with a talking bear.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born immediately after the book was accepted, said: “It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of a person who read it for the first time before publication.
It's very fun to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
He said that his father, who was inspired to write a children’s book on a small toy bear, worked as a cameraman for BBC, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book was the death of his father with a shadow last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom he described as “a very important member of our family,” he added that his father was silently proud of his final success.
“He was quite a quiet man and was not a proud man,” he said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was as if your child had achieved something: you are proud of them, even though it is not your achievement.
I believe he looked at Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always admitted Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
On landing, his daughter was taken to Nice Hospital in a hurry, Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors worked in vain to save his life.
“They called regularly to say that their daughter was in very bad shape and that they did not believe that she would survive,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received a call from Nad, who said that my daughter would die in two minutes, and I must say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The drugs the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating had begun to disappear quietly and to leave his body.
He was dead a while before that, and now all the systems have stopped working.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing what was gonna happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay together."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned her daughter, went on a plane with other passengers who knew nothing about her experiences.
"No one knew that," he said.
“I kept my head down and the tears flowed all this time.
It's hard to explain, but on that flight, I felt a terrible outburst of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
The postal cards of the grieving woman prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their beloved suicide nails work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey have taped cards to the Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help on.
Miss Davis' son Tyler was 13, when he was depressed, and when he was 18, when he killed himself.
“I do not want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“All knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile would make the room shine."
Nevertheless, he stopped working before he died because he was “in a very bad place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found his brother after taking his own life.
Mrs Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that it has a domino effect."
Ms. Davis created these maps “to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even with her friend.
Don't shut up – you need to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner not long after her husband's mother died.
“He did not say that he would feel bad or be depressed or anything,” he said.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at the lowest point on Christmas Day – when the children opened their presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
Ms. Humphreys said that the man’s death was a terrible trauma to them, but they must cope with it: “It will tear the wound into the entire family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we must move on and continue to fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on her hair while the FBI starts investigating.
“I believed that if we could actually get what he wanted – a limited study of time and scope – we might be able to achieve unity,” said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the Committee would “fall" in the middle of a permanent blockade of partisans.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate it?
Their reluctance was due to timing.
The interim elections will be held in just five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans are not expected to do well, they will be significantly weakened in their intentions to be the head of the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone to call the senators by lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The vote will take place in a Senate with 51 Republicans and 49 democracies at present.
At the moment, it is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice-President Mike Pence to give a decisive vote and to appoint Mr Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean troops under Kim's government is ‘repairing’
South Korea's legislation has said that the number of North Korean troops to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting South Korea's data from the Ministry of Harmonisation, said that compared to the 2011 military race (2706), their number has decreased last year (1127).
Mr Park said that the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a greater number of traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
South Korean citizenship has been offered to a large number of North Fleets.
According to Seoul magazine, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest state border with North Korea, and which is easier to overcome than a highly protected demilitarised area between two Koreas.
China takes the runaways as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their homeland with strength.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the heads of two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the abolition of non-proliferation weapons.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-uni in Singapore, where they promised to work towards the nuclear-free peninsula of Korea in general.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of failing to make progress in sanctions.
"The untrusted United States of America, our country lacks security, and in such circumstances, we are in no way willing to unilaterally render ourselves the first to be unarmed," said Mr Ri in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that the man was unfit to judge the Supreme Court.
The opposition leader of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, appointed Brett Kavanaugh as a “hysterical” candidate for the Supreme Court and said that the man was temporarily unfit to serve as a Supreme Court judge.
Pelosi delivered an opinion at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday’s interview.
“I couldn’t help but notice that if a woman had been called hysterical, she would have been called hysterical,” said Pelosi about her reaction to the testimony of Kavanaugh before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusation that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening speech, describing his family and high school years, he almost screamed from time to time and was sometimes speechless.
He also explicitly condemned members of the Democratic Party of the Committee, condemning the accusations against him of the loss of the Presidential elections of Hillary Clinton in 2016 as a organised "grotesque and coordinated murder" of angry Liberals.
According to Pelosi, he believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that a man is not fit to judge the Supreme Court because it showed that he has been held against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi remained modest when asked if he would try to withdraw Kavanaugh if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I say so much – if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only a judge of the Supreme Court, but he does not fit into the court where he is currently working,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Columbia District Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he is concerned about possible decisions against Kavanaugh's Affordable Care Act (Health Act – Translationary Comment) or Roe v Wade (Legal Judge-Rapporteur of Abortion – Translation Comment), because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
At his approval session, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“Now is not the time when a hysterical tilted person could become a judge and expect us to say, ‘Isn't it nice?’ said Pelosi.
And women have to wear it.
It's a fair choice of words, a month-and-a-year-long over-cold anger, and he can't get away with it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
He continued: “I received help from a woman who was somewhere in charge; she said that she was also crying when she got angry, but she developed a method that, when she got angry and started to cry, she said to someone she was talking to, ‘ You might think I’m crying because I’m sad.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are partially accepted as an output of rage because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is in an early job with a majority of men in the office, where I once found myself crying in the rage when an older woman — a strict leader, whom I had always been a little afraid — grabbed my collar and dragged me to the stairwell.
"Never show them how to cry," he told me.
“They don’t know you’re mad.
They think you're sad and it's satisfying them."
Patricia Schroeder, then Congressman of the Democratic Party from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on a man's presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a yacht called Monkey Business with an out-of-wedding love story and finished the campaign, Schroeder thought that there was no reason why he shouldn't think of running as president himself.
“It was not a well thought-out decision,” he said to me, laughing 30 years later.
“There were seven candidates, and the last thing they needed was for someone else to join.”
Someone said it's like "Snow White and Seven Frogs."
Since the campaign was coming to an end, he was late to raise money, and he promised not to run if he didn't get two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who donated $1,000 to the men gave him only $250.
“Do they think I get a discount?” he thought.
When he gave a speech stating that he was not going to launch an official campaign, feelings of gratitude for the people who supported him became irritable against a system that made it difficult to raise money and turn to voters instead of delegates and hatred for sexism — he was so overcome that he had tears in his throat.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Mr. Schroeder recalled his reaction to the press.
“I could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking about what they wrote on my tombstone.
"He cried?"
How the US-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The openings of the trade war between the US and China were complaining, and although the battle is far from over, according to experts, the transnational gap can be useful for Beijing in the long term.
This year, US President Donald Trump issued a first warning shot by imposing taxes on essential Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs for goods worth USD 200 billion (EUR 150 billion), essentially imposing taxes on half of the goods coming from China to the USA.
Beijing has responded the same way every time, the last time with five to ten percent tariffs, it is $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has promised to allow the US to respond by chance, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to blink soon.
Getting back to Washington would mean giving in to demands, but publicly worshiping the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing's maps are correctly out, the trade war with the US can support China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would lead to the loss of economic control in another country is in fact far more dangerous than those who have previously admitted,” said researcher Abigail Grace, who focuses on research in Asia at the Center for New American Security.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is ready to return refugees
According to Syria, the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for the aid of the reconstruction of the country after more than seven years of war.
In talking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country would improve.
“The situation is now more stable and safer on national territory thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to restore normality in the affected areas of terrorists.
Now there are all the conditions for refugees who have left the country on a voluntary basis due to terrorism and due to unilateral economic measures affecting everyday life and livelihoods.
According to UN forecast, 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid for the construction of a devastated country.
At the same time, he stressed that the State would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the upheaval.
Europe took over the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup Competitions by defeating the US team's final result at the Le Golf National golf course near Paris in France, 16.5 vs 10.5.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe was once again crowned by the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team to be 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
Throughout the tournament, the US star Phil Mickelson struck the wing on the par-3 track in 16 waters, giving the victory to Francesco Molinar.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have won the tournament in the current format in 1979 5 : 0 : 0.
With 5&4 results, the American Jordan Spieth was executed by Dan Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest on the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, led Ian Poulter with 2 and 1 England, who may have been the last to win this Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup Veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European in all time.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the cup back.
It's about the team spirit, and I'm glad I could help," said the emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He's passing the torch on to fellow countryman Jon Rahm, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
“I feel extremely proud that I won Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four fights in France, and now he has a career in Ryder's Cup Contest 13 : 21 : 3.
Strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who've won 14 majors titles, leaving only Jack Nicklaus behind.
The U.S. team was on the verge of finding fairways all weekend; except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
After being disappointed by the team, U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m proud of the guys, they were cynical.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europeans.
We fought them.
Put your hat down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players did a very good job.
Let's get together, work with America's PGA and our Ryder Cup Competition Committee and move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We need to lift the hat.
We were better played."
New water flower information: concentration decreased in Pinellas, Manatees and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a general decrease in the concentration of flowering algae in the Gulf of Tampa.
According to the FWC, there are reports of a greater prosperity in the regions of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which are indicative of decreasing concentrations.
The extent of the bloom is about 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from the northern part of the Pinellas county to the southern part of the Lee county.
