The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the settlement, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide on the implementation of the following municipalities separately.
Municipal elections will be held next time in 2016.
After the accession of Juankoski, the population of Kuopio is approximately 111,000.

Putin: Ukrainian troops shooting civilians
On Monday, President Vladimir Putin accused the leadership of Kiev of refusing direct political discussions with the separatists in Eastern Ukraine.
The current leadership in Kiev does not want to conduct an essential political debate with the east of its country, says Putin, according to Itar-Tass, a news agency.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, who are said to be assisted by the Russian army in Kiev and the West, tried to push the Ukrainian troops further away from their current positions, where Putin said that the Ukrainian army was shooting civilians.
The goal of militia fighters is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not have the opportunity to shoot the inhabitants of the area, said Putin.
The event took place on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmi Station.
It surprised me that the crowd came from the beginning of the night.
There were visitors within two days expected, says Promotor Tom Kangas.
The wall river Hiphop Festival was organised for the third time.
Next year again.
We're still going to be hip-festers, so no pops are allowed, Kangas assures us.
On Tuesday, Finland will come into force a law restricting the acquisition of explosives suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals will have to apply to the Police Department for a permit to buy or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as a starting substance for explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing them if the specified concentration levels are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide, for example, is present in detergents and detergents, but concentrations do not usually exceed the limit values.
Nitrogen is used, for example, when driving.
However, precursors acquired before the entry into force of the law may be held and used until 2 March 2016.

Valaoliga: Super Raheem gleam - Mario remained in the shadow - Valaoliga - Ilta-Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered to be the hope for the future of English football.
On Sunday, White Hart Lane had an electronic atmosphere when Mario Balotelli’s strengthened Liverpool arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
The first appearance of Super Mario was promising: experienced British journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a different attitude than in Manchester City.
The ballet was still a long way from its top violet.
The Italian lost three high-quality targets and fed only half of his sixteen feeds to his own team.
Pool carriers who have already taken the player’s favourite will expect better.
The Liverpool-manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotelli in Barcelona to play Luis Suarez as the second attacker of the team alongside Daniel Sturridge.
Instead of Balotelli, the team stared at the top of the middle field diamond, Raheem Sterling, who pushed the 3-0 win past the important opening paint of Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, it's not just about the power.
A Britishman less than 20 cents shorter than Balotellia is between the opponent’s lines than a fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who thanks to the grass at best for about 34 km per hour.
Rodgers also deserves great thanks for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Irelander reported on how Liverpool has systematically developed a more comprehensive player from Wembley, a Northwest Londonist.

Rovaniemi women's volley league Woman Volley stumbled on the league climber Vampula Sportsmen at the finals of the training tournament on Sunday.
Vampula turned five of a stretched match into a 3-2 win.
The last batch of WoVo lost between 15 and 11.
The neighbor was one step ahead all the time.
The fight was good, but Vampula was a little better in the defense game and in the passport game, and Teemu Mäkikyrö, coach of WoVo, saw.
WoVon's six was so shaky that a 19-inch American centimetre Jennifer Keddy was stuck in her back.
Sara Niemi played as a center.
Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play with Johanna Pekkarinen in spite of her thumb horse and formed the most powerful combination of WoVon.
Jenna Keskmäki, who started as a hacker, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzeme for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of the injury was the skilled Russian passport and the liberal Hillael Hämäläinen, which WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo’s preparation for the league will continue next week when Hämeenlinna’s HPK comes to the training camp in Rovaniemi.
On Saturday, the team will meet at the "trader" at 6 p.m. in the official training game.
On Sunday, we'll meet again at the sports school.
Lidl is takin' wild numbers in Finland
During the financial year ending at the end of February, the net sales of Finnish stores increased by almost 25 per cent to nearly EUR 1.2 billion.
The company released its results on Monday.
Lidl now has 142 stores in Finland, and further enlargement is planned.
Lidl also said that he paid almost EUR 14 million of taxes to Finland for the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4 200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more common due to delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment in sparsely populated areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released the video as a tribute to her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia are at greater risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers reviewed the patient data of over 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent of women, more than five years after the diagnosis.
Chief Researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers went through women’s health history for seven years.
According to the doctor Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
In older women and when cancer was more widespread, the probability of survival at the time of diagnosis was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to find out why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment as possible.
"Gynecological oncology doctors are the best at dealing with this disease, and their receptions are mostly in large cities," Jordan says.
Although long-term care is becoming more widespread and the importance of distances is diminished, the researcher also proposes increasing the mobility of doctors so that specialist doctors can treat patients closer to their home and programmes to support patients treated at a distance from home.
According to a study by Dr. Jordan, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor, regardless of geographical location, which highlights the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a 33-year-old housewife living in Gold Coast found Elisha Neave’s malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to confirm the parking lot in the park of friendship, which is located next to the hotel Pohjanhov.
On Monday, the City Government decided that the proposal for a status plan for the friendlyness park and its surroundings would be made publicly available to Osviitta.
The draft plan is requested from the Environment Board and the Lapland Ely Centre.
With the change in the station plan, the city wants to make it possible for tourism-related snow mobile activity to continue in the region.
The aim is to create a park area that includes the area between the present Park of Friendship and the river.
On-the-spot, between 15 November and 30 April, a maximum of 200 snowmobiles shall be permanently available.
The area may also be equipped with refuelling points.
The new park area is also allowed for maintenance traffic.
The town of Rovaniemi has rented the area of the friendship park for safari companies for snowmobile use during the winter.
The lease agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and is valid until spring 2018.
Even loudly voiced opposition has been triggered by the activity of the snowmobile and the change in the design.
The residents of the neighbouring blocks have been in trouble, both in terms of voice and concern about emissions.
However, the area's emissions have been investigated and studies have not revealed any findings beyond the reference values.
The new equipment is even more low-emission than the old ones.
The park of friendship as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the place of departure were to be moved further away, the hotel’s safari customers should be transported to the safari’s departures by buses estimated at 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and the surrounding environment of the friendship park are also large enough, better than the places presented as substitute points of departure, such as the eastern entrance to the boat platform on the Ounasjoki bridges.
The friendlyness park is good for its location, even because in the future, activities can expand to include the Ounaspaviljong region.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of the urban strategy adopted by the City Council of Rovaniemi, which aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business activities by providing sufficient quality areas for logistically and functionally affordable locations.
The friendship park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobiles in the central sub-universal formula, which has not yet gained legal power.
The decline in owner-occupied dwellings is seen in garden shops
The decrease in the number of residents, especially in a group under 35 years of age, may lead to a tens of millions of sales of garden shops, when today's young consumers reach the "target group" of garden sales on their age. The Financial Times reported on the study conducted by the British Association of Horticultural Trades (HTA).
According to a financial Times report, only 55 percent of the money spent by the owners of the dwelling is spent on gardening.
The study also showed that more and more people live in very urbanised apartments with no gardens, and that the size of the garden is decreasing as the front yard is increasingly covered as a parking lot. These factors also threaten the garden area, which is estimated at GBP 5 billion per year.
In the major region of London, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, where garden products spend the lowest amount of money per household in the whole country.
However, according to HTA and the UK Garden Association (RHS), the increase in renting housing or the reduction in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
The leading horticultural adviser at RHS, Guy Barter, says that "for example, plants grown in transferable growing vessels are particularly popular among tenants, since such growing vessels can be included as necessary".
According to the HTA report, the 1997-2005 period of re-sales in the garden sector was the booming season, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the end of the 80s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that this year, thanks to better weather conditions, trade will become worse than last year's weather in March and April.
Turkey's interviewing US diplomats for a spy report.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey has invited the country's most experienced US diplomat to provide a report on the report on U.S. and British spying in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the U.S. ambassador and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and The Intercept have written that the documents leaked by former analyst Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency (NSA), reveal that Turkey was the main spy on the US and UK intelligence services.
According to the Turkish news offices, Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan minimized the importance of the report, saying that all major countries have been spying on each other.
The previous report on spying on the German main intelligence service Ankara produced a more angry reaction in the Turkish Government.

The man's main part of 2 nights in the morning is Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will receive its premiere in Finland in September 2015.
Police Chief Mallorcan Magaluf accused of corruption
Those who gave evidence of blackmail by police and Calvià city government officials at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor’s Office on Friday.
Calvià police chief on the island of Mallorca have been arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by shop owners and bar owners in the Magaluf area known for the wet celebration.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was put in custody after several shop owners of the Punta Ballena street filed corruption charges against him. The street of Punta Ballena is home to most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs.
According to the daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, who reported the case, evidence was provided by police and Calvià City Council officials of the Office of the Prosecutor against Corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with the corruption charges, and they are being questioned by the judge in conjunction with Navarro.
The countrywide daily ABC wrote about the neutrality of the angry authorities of the owners of nightclubs, which significantly made their business difficult.
"It's no longer about money, it's about survival," said one business owner to the court.
You're not destroying our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in several countries in the headlines of magazines this summer, when a YouTube video spread online, where an 18-year-old British holidayer was having oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crash.
Since then, the authorities of the island have tried to control the intoxicated and uncontrolled use of Magaluf holidayers by reducing the number of participants in the infamous, alcoholic pub crackles.
In addition, the Playhouse Night Club, in which the oral sex video was filmed, was set to be closed for a year, and the owner of the nightclub and the organiser of pub crawl were imposed on Carnage a fine of EUR 55 000.
In particular, among young British tourists, its recommendation in Magaluf's tourist destination has also become popular with the so-called balconing trend, which has caused a number of alcohol-related accidents when people have jumped from balcony to balcony or balcony to hotel pool.
The children of Israel return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children returned to school in the Gaza Strip on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and mortars bombed their communities in the 50 - day Israel - Hamas war and the schools remained closed as the region recovered from battles.
The opening of schools brought joy and excitement to the communities of southern Israel bombed by rockets, but the signs of battle are still visible.
In the city of Ashdod in the south of the Pashosh day care centre, the workers removed traces of shrapnel from the walls and slides before the children arrived at the day care center after the rocket hit.
"We are a little scared, but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbush called Saat, an Israeli community and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area desperately need routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, thinks that coming back to school in a long time feels a little weird.
"We've had hard times sometimes when we didn't leave home," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbus near the Gaza border to provide his support.
Before the start of last week's ceasefire, thousands of residents of communities such as Saat had stayed indoors or left their homes in safer areas beyond Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza front are suspicious of the return of the Palestinian grenade after the death of a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, a good ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border that was subject to a heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "children’s education and safety would be taken care of".
Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire for the time being last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the fighting, but it did not provide a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas's demand for the abolition of the Israeli-Egypt archipelago and the reopening of Gazan air and sea roads.
Israel wants to strip Hamas of his weapons and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers who have fallen in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected in Egypt later this month.
According to the Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2 100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed on the number of dead, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it had no solid evidence of this.
66 soldiers and six civilians died on Israel’s side, including Thai workers.
In battles, Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4 591 rockets and grenades to the Israeli cities mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, for its part, carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people fled for protection to over 100 UN - maintained schools that had been transformed into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people are still protected and as the battles continue, school officials moved the school to begin last week.
"I hope the school opens soon and we get back to school, just as other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old, who lives in a sheltered school in Gaza City.
According to the commonly used meter, housing prices have increased most to seven years in the winter months of Australia.
The price index for RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic dwellings in the capital of Australia rose by 1.1 per cent in August, according to RP’s data on Monday.
As a result of the rise in prices during the summer, July and August period, the increase was 4.2 per cent, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not steadily risen throughout the country.
According to RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price rise.
RP Data results show that housing prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 per cent and in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent in the previous year.
The housing market in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is the next largest; the average price increase is from five to six per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government expenditure cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring beginning in Australia will increase the number of dwellings sold in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"In view of the increase in the sales of dwellings to be auctioned, the generally lively rate of sales and the continuing low interest rate, it is likely that the price increase of housing will continue to continue over the next three months," says Lawless.
The new Gösta museum has drawn record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and art have attracted record audiences this summer to Mänttä.
By the end of August, more than 70 000 visitors have visited Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and there have been classic works of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttä's art weeks again told us that he had made a visitor record on Monday, when 14 500 interested people visited this summer's "Handon" event.
These figures are not used to.
People have been shoveling from doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen of Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to Serlachius Museums will be 100 thousand this year.
In previous years, there have been some 40,000 visitors.
In Mänttä-Villupula, the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, there are about 11 000 inhabitants.
The museum director Sivonen reminds us that new museums are always when they open up.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
It is hoped that the period of art will continue far beyond the summer.
New exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum in autumn.
The police are investigating four recent thefts in Kajaan.
On Sunday night, in the northern part of the Nordic Region, business property was broken into by breaking the window.
The unsub had received a small amount of money from the cashier.
Between Thursday and Monday, a truck tank fuel had been stolen on Deepwater Street.
In fact, between Sunday and Monday a boat had been taken from the port of Petäinenska with its outboard engines.
The rowing boat was a fish platter-marked outer blonde and the inside yellowish.
On the inside, it read "OVA" on the back of the nose.
A couple of suspects of stealing from the police have had enough time to catch him.
On Sunday night, a business property was broken into the Tikkapuron Road.
The police dog was traced, and a 20-year-old Paltamo man was found hiding in the woods under the tree.
On Monday, the police caught another man from Paltama who was also suspected of having committed the same break-in.
A missing amphetamine brought a murder charge in Kajaan
The disappearance of less than ten grams of amphetamine brought a murder charge to a Kajaan man born in 1977.
According to the D.A., the man had gone to the apartment with his partner and another man, and shot with a shotgun the owner of the apartment he suspected to export drugs, a 34-year-old Kajan woman.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed to have been accompanied by another man as a shooter.
The case became known to the police when police patrol stopped a passenger car with a company burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to the burnt clothes, a broken shotgun was found in the car.
The district court of Kainuu will give judgment on the matter later.
In many places, August was rarely warm.
According to the Department of Meteorological Sciences, August is as warm as it is once every ten years on average.
The statistics of the AME show that the average temperature was higher than normal throughout the country.
In most of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the heat of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature throughout the summer was measured at the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed 33.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born in Dudley, a family of seven children from Jamaica, in the British Midlands, 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory, and he died when he was 19 years old.
Henry is currently practicing for Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on his father's imaginary conversation and has been developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
The sound track is a mix of reggaeta and rap in the upbeat pace.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
She has been in therapy several times since her mother died, and she is considering a lot of her relationship with her father.
It was very difficult to read my father.
His face was never visible, only his voice said, "Stop the noise."
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at the cricket now.
My parents, Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the shape of a beer cup or the beauty of a cricket.
I never talked to him about that kind of thing.
For the most part of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal molten plant in Dudley and thus received an idea of what his father’s life must have been like, although the working conditions are better today than they were at the time.
The melting plants are a little brighter today, but they are practically dark, smoke-like, maze-like depths where flames, smokes, and beaks, and they remind you of the dome.
The father used to go to the bath and only to lie in the bathtub, and slowly he started singing to himself when he washed away the molten dirt.
As I walked around the melting plant, I realized that he had worked for years to get us food, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry’s childhood was lacking in the closeness offered by his parents.
My father never hugged me and never said he loved me.
Only when my mother began to get sick a little before she died did we begin to repeat to each other that we love each other.
Henry has Billie's daughter Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love that he himself lacked as a child.
Do you have to play "I love you" all the time?
Stop hugging!
Dad, I'm 22.
With Dawn French.
Why aren't we friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend of French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to Mother's death.
When I began to suffer from excessive obesity and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
After that, I started to exercise a lot, and I also had to start a hard diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known short beard may describe his change during his career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from the critics about his role as Othellona, he has become absorbed in the work of the theatre.
Next up were the comedy of errors and August Wilson's Fences ("Aids").
Making a theatre offers a different experience than the citcoms and comedy Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry only started a 16-year-old factory worker when he was in the business.
A dishesman noticed him doing imitations on the stage and contacted the New Faces talent contest.
Henry's TV career started in the mid-70s. "I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV for a long time," he says.
Henry learned how to do the job.
I had to grow up in the light of the audience, I had to learn how to make jokes from the slide belt between 1975 and 1985, while I was on TV, and it was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager was entitled to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared in black makeup, so Henry ended up being a comedian for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never been involved in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and depraved, I was able to work in enormous events and learned how to deal with the audience.
Yet, "British TV's award-winning, multi-annual favorite and light entertainment program" was also a "poor parody of black people".
Henry worked in the second series of comedy in the 80s, where both jokes were made and the black British culture was admired.
The Lenny Henry Show's first episode was shown in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
The following decade Henry spent with ads, documents, TV series and film parts, but after his series of LennyHenry.TV shows in BBC in 2008, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len – now it looks like you're just riding around or on the sidelines".
Next up was Radio 4 documentary series "What's So Great About...?".
The first part covered Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not really taught to us at school properly, and I think it belonged to the white middle class, which wears tights and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare theme caused me to be afraid.
All the people we interviewed on the show – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, "Try.
Don't give up the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
So why don't you just date words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much?
Henry said 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary, and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It almost seemed as if some part of me had been absent earlier, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background study.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The play was finally a success.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but it did not quite happen.
Soon after that, Henry played the main part in the Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly, I was acting at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't quite believe it.
At one point I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There were once technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A small voice in my mind said to me, "You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again."
On the other hand, the assistant director announced that the proposal would continue as soon as the problem had been corrected.
I walked out of the stage, and some of me sighed at relief.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to the others.
"You're part of the play, stay in your role."
Henry "Fences" at the Duchess Theatre
Learning to play "Fences" was challenging.
Panic is a good thing. It makes people more sustainable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you must do."
That's what Henry says, of course, with a URBAN voice.
So I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love practice rooms.
However, Henry is basically still a comedian: little humorous sons are constantly interrupting our conversation as he changes from imitation to imitation.
It is a matter of will to abstain from the Stand-up Commission, because it seems dangerous to receive immediate thanks from an unknown audience.
If you keep thirsting for it, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when it feels like it, but in general it no longer inspires me the way it used to be.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna go on another stand-up tour again.
It brings me real joy to sit together with the director, who will help shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey, and I do not think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new birth?
I think so.
I like acting...
It's really funny.
The show keeps telling the story, and that's what I like about it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya is creating a register of officials to remove "monster workers"
Kenya has begun to draw up a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove "monster workers" from the government's salary lists.
Workers who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, were announced in the Board of Directors' Notice.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid after they have left office.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public sector when he entered office in 2013.
According to the audit carried out earlier this year, at least one million dollars per month was spent on the wages and other financial abuses of "hull workers".
The government suspects that salaries will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left office, BBC’s Wanyama Chebusiri reports on the capital Nairobi.
In order to ensure that their information is stored in biometric form, all officials must report to the register in the following weeks in the identification centres, as specified in the Government Notice.
According to the press release, any who fail to do so without due cause shall be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector, as it will determine how many people are actually working in its capacity, and will also clear the paylists at both levels of the government, which will solve the problem of "monster workers"," says Anne Waiguru, the office official of the Ministry of decentralisation and Planning.
The result for the accounts of Seinäjoki in 2015 may remain EUR 25.5 million in deficit, unless the city adapts its operations and expenditure developments in a tight economic situation.
On the basis of the current draft budget, the annual margin is falling to some 9.4 million deficits.
The possible means of improving efficiency were to reduce the scope and level of services, to purchase services, to sell assets and grants, and to increase tax and payment revenues.
The investment target of EUR 10 million is EUR 8,5 million.
There is no relief in the situation of municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient tax revenue growth, rising unemployment and a 5% cut in government shares will further undermine the outlook.
The aim of the economic seminar is to find new ways of balancing the economy.
The City Government agrees that savings must be achieved.
The ship must be translated into a strategic objective, says Kimmo Heinonen, President of the City Government.
The city government has yet to prepare the presentations for the management team.
The proposals of the City Government will be based on budget preparation at the Council's economic seminar in Fram on Monday, 8 September.
Following the Council seminar, the draft budget will proceed to the city government and to the city council through the committee's deliberations.
Tens of Turkish police officers arrested as suspects against the "drunk" government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspects of "ungovernment plots", local media sources report.
The police did not comment immediately.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were arrested.
Some police officers were involved in corruption investigations last December involving government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey for the organisation of a large-scale crime zone and the monitoring of telephones.
The Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as Prime Minister during this period) said that police activities are part of the planned activities of Islamic leader Fethullah Gullen against him and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most of the schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This is a traditionally important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time he told the waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September was not held in every school.
There is no peace throughout Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, who is a leading teacher at Slaviansk School, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter goes, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that the children will be able to learn something that will benefit them in the future.
Festivals on the first day of school include traditional children’s written shirts, balloons and the giving of flowers to teachers.
According to the Texas Perry, an abusive tweet was unauthorized.
On Sunday night, a blatant image of the Democratic District Attorney was sent from a Twitter account confirmed by Governor Rick Perry in the middle of hearing charges of abuse of authority.
Tweetti was later removed, followed by a new tweet where Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweetti was sent out unauthorized from my account.
"I don't accept a tweet and I've removed it," the later publication said.
Perry's backup forces did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it's unclear who published the photo.
The first tweet contained a despicable image of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of driving drunk in April 2013.
Perry prevented the funding of Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, which led to a large jury meeting in Austin this month when Perry was accused. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
Tweet's title was, "I don't always drive drunk, three times more than allowed, but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing the finger at me."
I'm the drunkest democracy in Texas.
The Lehmberg Office did not conduct a grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antionio, appointed by the Republican Judge.
Perry has said he's innocent and called the charges a political plot.
His influential judicial team has asked the judge to dismiss the accusations and said that the law on the charge of the most remote governor in Texas is unclear in relation to the constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million of state aid to the state's public inviolability unit operating in Travis County and handling public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision led a left-based monitoring team to issue a formal complaint.
Perry’s confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes famously.
After the fifth place in the Iowa election meeting during its 2012 presidential election campaign, Perry threatened to end the game by publishing on Twitter a picture of himself running on the lake with the text "Here we come, South Carolina!"
Berkeley says that the housing market is "normal" again.
One of London's most important builders has warned that the housing market in south-eastern England has "repaired" to a normal level of activity.
The capital of London has been plagued by huge demand and a sharp rise in prices, while fearing a widespread credit bubble, which led the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
On Monday, the founder of a high-level builder, Berkeley, and President Tony Pidgley, said that "since the beginning of the financial year, the market and the number of shops have returned to normal since the 2013 peak" and added that this has enabled a "stable environment".
In the London housing market, foreign investors went well during the recession as they reached the capital by herd.
According to the country register, housing prices in the city rose by 18,5 per cent only in the previous year, thus clearly exceeding the average in England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices of private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose by about the fifth year, reaching an increase of GBP 423 000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London's properties less attractive in recent months - some of the interests have also been influenced by the new property tax laws and political rhetoric about the possible 'cart tax' before the general elections in May.
The London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported stricter lending orders, would lead to lower market growth both in terms of sales volumes and prices of real estate in the second half of the year.
On Monday, recent information from the Bank of England showed that the number of loans accepted decreased in July, indicating a cooling housing market.
Real estate agent Hamptons International has calculated its 2015 forecast of London real estate prices by three per cent, as the index measuring the prices of housing owners has already started to decline.
The number of stores made in the most expensive parts of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped to a quarter of the year ago, according to the real estate broker WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, who increased income from sold properties to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the demand for the most well-designed, correct product in the best places has remained stable and therefore the sales have remained active".
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, which is almost a third more than at the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
The annual profit before taxes rose by 40% year-on-year, resulting in an increase of GBP 380 million and an increase in turnover by 18% to GBP 1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the annual meeting of the company, Pidgley told us that Berkeley's annual earnings were in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit is GBP 450 million.
Berkeley's stock was sold on the London Stock Exchange at a steady price of £23.96 this afternoon.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's naked photos into the network.
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving at the 85th annual Academy Awards.
A hacker who claims to hold a hundred other stars in possession of pictures leaked to the Internet by Oscar's actor Jennifer Lawrence.
The star star representative confirmed that the images are genuine and condemned the hacker for "a arrogant violation of privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes the stolen pictures of Jennifer Lawrence will be charged.
The pictures that were originally published on the 4chan image release page were apparently placed in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud recording system. For the sake of 100 other hacking, the list claims that there are dozens of other women's stars, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsteaden and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed.
It is not known how much of the pictures are authentic, although Scott Pilgrim versus the World Star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
"For those who watch pictures taken years ago in the privacy of my home and my husband: hopefully you have a good mind", Winstead tweet.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's iCarly and Victoria's "Victorious" series denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that " these so-called naked images of me are DETERMINED, don't you understand."
Let me put an end to this right away.
BuzzFeedin announced late on Sunday that the representative of the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the pictures of the star.
Only an extract of Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter J
They slipped, it pictured the best of what had happened, gradually breaking apart like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only on occasion did she hear from her that she was too serious, laborious, intense, detached, and perhaps also a bit peaky.
That's when he shaked his hand.
He recognized the spike.
Yeah, he was like a pig.
The last victim of his thorns had, however, been a relationship that had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might have even brought some substance into his life.
Ailin Solomons had untenable hair and was a delicately delicate beauty with a cheerful heart, a northern village that was even more harsh and far from everything Port Reuben.
He had come to the south with an older traveling companion who Kevern assumed to be his aunt. The aunt had inherited a house in a wet but paradise valley, and the name of the valley was the Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, there were spiders in all the bathrooms, the etans had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place to themselves, there were weeds growing in the garden that looked like giant cabbage heads.
The cabin was like children's fairy tales, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Written by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
The nominations will be published next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn in his hand with a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening dissatisfiedly to the reception through which the whole country heard calm music and soothing news, when Ailin's crucified, sun-brown feet reminded Kevern of a song that had long since been sang by a forgotten black performer and which his father had often listened to at the bottom of the cabin's blinds.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were generally too aggressive and were no longer played on the receiver.
They were not banned — nothing was actually prohibited — but they were no longer played.
They were meant to be forgotten, as was the word forgotten.
The public opinion did not achieve what the law and the proclamation had not achieved: just as people in the area of literature chose to read heroes' memories, cookbooks and romances, for music they favour the ballads.
By the wildest of the day, Kevern began to tap the imaginary piano and sing serenad to the big legs of Alinn with a loud, comical voice.
Ailin didn't understand.
"It was the famous song of the jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and he naturally raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the letter "j" got out of his lips.
It had started as a game between him and Dad when he was little.
His father told me he played the same game with his own father.
If you let a j-word come out of your mouth, and you didn't remember raising two fingers in front of your mouth, you'd have to pay for a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game back then, and it wasn't even now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailin had never heard of that.
Neither had Jazz been declared prohibited, but it was not just played.
The improvisation was no longer fashionable.
There was only room in life for one if-word.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It had been the same for the clever.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the cleverness of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the time he was ten years old, jazz music had become known to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
Considering Alinn’s age, it was likely that he did not remember a time when popular singers were not black.
Even here, there was no need for laws or forcing.
The famous society meant that each part of it was gratefully accepted — gratefully, that they were saved as if by luck — the principle that each group did things natural to it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, African-Caribbeani roots are best suited for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally, those from the Indian continent were naturally gifted with electrical equipment, so it was their job to ensure that each family had a working telephone used to handle things.
Those who were left in the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the ferry.
When SE, which occurred, was from the Gulf of Persia and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not vehemently fled in fear of being charged with the flames and afraid that they would be reached by the flames next, opened restaurants serving labneh yogurt and burning a water pipe, and continued their lives as creatures and boredom.
Let each one act according to his gifts.
Ailin had only heard the ballads, and it was difficult for him to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sang could ever be dressed as music.
Through music, love was expressed.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe bigfoots.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of giant cabbage leaves.
Ailin still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was a joke, but he didn't want to lift two fingers on his lips with Alinn.
Ailin thought he was weird right now.
"It was funny in my father's mind," he said instead.
Ailin's head was shattered unbelievably, and his hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
There's nothing to see in the whole world except Ailinn's huge, shady hair soft.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailin seemed genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your legs aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you", but it was too early for that.
"I find you attractive because of your fat ankles," he tried to fix it.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This wasn't helping.
He wanted it to sound fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, had no convincing charm to control the cruelty of a joke.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailin Solomons blushed and rose from his terrace and at the same time poured the receiver and poured the wine they had just had.
The wine had only been made from the back of his back, so he couldn't use it as the reason for the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake like palm leaves in a storm.
"And your thick head is what's got me twisted in you," he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Alinn and for his own unnecessary, cruel words, and for the fear that appeared in this sight at the moment Ailin decided to stand up against him.
Did Ailin think he'd hit you?
He had never told Kevern about his life in a giant northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was certain that basically it was the same as life here.
The same huge, giant sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though even more pale and diabolical than their smuggler and disintegration parents, wandered from pub to pub, ready to hit every woman who dared to resist or tease them.
Fat head?
He'd see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
First suck – kissing had become the most common word for erotic encounters between a man and a woman; first suck and then attack the antiquity of meaningless love balls pumping out the receiver.
Kevern felt that it was too much, because in itself it was hostile to suck.
Ailin Solomons' body language told him to leave.
He pulled himself out of a chair like an old man.
Ailin also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern’s grief surprised him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailin followed him — just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go out the window upstairs — a man who was himself responsible for his heavy life.
Adam's leaving the garden, he's thinking.
He felt compassion for Kevern and the men in general, although some had raised their hands against him in order to strike.
A man who turned his back, bowed down, ashamed, beaten, lost all the will to fight — why did he feel that that vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he would have seen it before this moment?
When Ailin Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the recent event, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, Esme Nussbaum, who worked at a private facility in Offow, measuring the General Opinion, made a brief study of the continuation of low and medium-hard violence in the regions of the country where the reduction, or even the end, was most likely to take into account the money and energy used to eradicate it.
"A lot has already been achieved, and much still remains to be done," he wrote, "to make up for thousands of years the natural aggression of the people who have fought and most often won, especially in those abandoned and isolated places, where, despite the church towers that extend across the shrubs, human beings are rarely known in time to come.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it produces.
The people are crying about sentimental ballads, abhorring stories about the ills they won and swearing on the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time the old-fashioned cruelty keeps both rural communities and urban community areas in its perseverance, and there is also evidence of a new, more evil-minded fight in homes, workplaces, streets and even in play parks.
"You must regret the tendency to dramatise," his director commented after reading the entire report.
I'd suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum fell his eyes on the ground.
And I have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to appeal to the right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I am opposed to atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
There are no prejudices in this job.
We are servants of an unprejudiced society.
Although certain hypersensitivity is in itself completely acceptable and respectful, it can sometimes lead to distorted results, the kind of things you just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the church — and what you call cruelty or maliciousness, others generally call natural energy and physical strength.
What happened, as if it had happened yesterday, will destroy the fundamental life force of the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around talking to Rabinowitz.
Behind the head of Rabinowitz, a flamingo-red LED light declared the instruction that Ofnow had already given to the country in the previous quarter or longer.
Smile to your neighbor, respect your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence and the sang word is better than written, but nothing beats love.
"I understand well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied with a quiet voice when he was sure that his director had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that, if we are not warned, we will see that we repeat the same mistakes that initially led to the incident.
True, this time we do not pour out our hatred and distrust of others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "as you describe yourself as 'mistakes' the actions our grandparents may have done or not done.
You are also going too far to say that they poured out their anger and distrust on others.
A person like you should not have to remind you that when it comes to understanding the past or defending the present, we are not talking about 'we' or 'they'.
There was no 'we' or 'other'.
That was chaos time, that's all we know about it.
"If we are absolutely honest, in that chaos," Esme dared to continue, "no group in society can say that they have behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, whether it was good or bad.
That's when it was.
There is no need to talk more about it – that is what we agree on.
And just as it is unnecessary to share accusations, neither do there need to be corrections, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is a way of doing them.
But for what purpose does the past exist, if you don't learn about it --
The past exists so we can forget it.
If there's one more thing I can add--
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said and said, "It was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, when he went to work in the normal way, he was hit by a motorcyclist on the sidewalk, whose driving by was described by passers as "bad and angry".
Accidents happen.
The Lesotho Army prohibits planning a strike; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho’s army officials have denied to stage a strike to overthrow the government and said that they were acting against a police officer suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country saying that the army had surrounded his official apartment and conquered government buildings in Maseru.
The Head of State and his family traveled to a neighbouring country in South Africa after telling them that he had suffered a death threat.
Major Ntle Ntoi, a representative of the army, denied the attack and said that the army had thus responded to the threat posed by the "political fanatics". The police have been told that they were trying to arm fanatics.
"Lesotho's defence forces took action when they received several intelligence that some police forces were trying to arm young party fanatics when they were ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America news agency.
According to the President of the South African Government, Clayson Monroe, the military's actions seemed like a revolution attempt.
"Although no body has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces seem to be equivalent in every respect to the signs of the revolution attempt," he says.
According to the officials of the Lesotho army, soldiers return to their armies on Sunday, and the capital had a peaceful atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes that he is subject to action because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane interrupted the parliamentary sessions because of the differences between the government of the great coalition.
He thus denies the power of the government, although it is claimed otherwise.
Store magazine: Microsoft will set up a data centre in Uusimaa
The IT company Microsoft has set up a large data centre in Uusimaa, where the company does not agree to specify its location.
In Microsoft’s media release, the company notes that it does not indicate the location of all its data centres for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars for Microsoft.
In public, Oulu or Kajan had previously been bets on the centre.
Microsoft will complete its Oulu office, which will take the job from around 500 people.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will quit up to 1 050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, Microsoft’s communications director, tells STT that the company does not comment on how many staff are employed by the new data centre.
The creation of a data centre in Uusimaa was reported by the Trade Journal on Monday.

Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos underwater, you have several different devices options to choose from.
The cheapest option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shot camera, such as Nikon Coolpixel AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both cost about $300.
I personally took these photos at the family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than 350 dollars.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that you should follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts of the camera are closed in a watertight way.
In addition, set camera configurations to match images or videos to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of cameras and video cameras have a set to optimize camera conditions underwater.
Furthermore, before you jump into the water, make sure that your device can be taken to a depth.
Some cameras can only withstand the depth of 5 feet, others can withstand the depth of 50-60 feet.
Check out both the usual and watertight models in our shopping guide and in the reviews of digital cameras.
Take several pictures — many of them fail in some way.
The compact cameras have a LCD display that allows you to reassemble the image, while the action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have a LCD, it's hard to see underwater, and it can either succeed or fail.
So take a number of pictures.
If your camera also allows for forging, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is significantly reduced at a deeper level.
If possible, stay close to the surface while shooting in a swimming pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors in your photos; the deeper you go, the less colors will be visible.
Try to get close to the target you're describing.
This is important advice when describing the ground, but even more important under water, because the light conditions are limited.
It is very important when an action camera is used: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide image angle, i.e. the photographer has to be close to the target in order to fill the whole picture frame.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders — protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters should not be allowed to select candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing peace of democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a spark to the long-awaited protests in Hong Kong's business district, after activists have started planning and implementing demonstrations only hours after the decision has been published.
The decision of the People's Congress in China gives practically the Communists the power to take out all the candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it is still infuriating," says the President of the Democratic Party, the legislator Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to the Hong Kongers.
It is clear that we are working with a self-responsive regime.
Li Fei, Deputy Secretary General of the Chinese People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese regime, saying that the general candidate for the election of Hong Kong's leader would be too 'coastal'.
Since 1997, when the UK handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised its residents that it would be able to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to the Chinese leaders, the decision on Sunday was a democratic breakthrough, because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to closely control the electoral process through the Nomination Committee, which is managed from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
In the summer before the decision, Hong Kong organised some of the largest and most prominent protests in the region for years.
The campaign to defend democracy was largely supported by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisers have threatened to block the business district if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine general right to vote.
On Sunday night, only hours after the decision was published, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in front of Hong Kong’s main administrative buildings.
In the demonstration, the movement’s organisers announced that the movement would move to a new era of civil disobedience and that they would bring about waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not tell the details, apparently fearing that this would lead to problems with the authorities.
In their online newsletter, the organisers said that "the movement will consider the Occupy Central campaign to be the last means that will only be introduced if there is no hope for dialogue and there is no other way".
We are very sorry to announce that today the last opportunity for dialogue has been lost and the takeover of the centre will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tightly close to the main government buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest is a source of concern for many to feel that the inhabitants are slowly losing control of their city.
The wave from the continent has caused competition for products and services.
Furthermore, there is fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten Hong Kong’s vitality — the business world.
"The test they are talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people will be involved and how long it will take," says Regina Ip, the legislator, who has been criticising the movement for a long time.
We don't want to have any concern about Hong Kong getting out of our grip.
It would be a bad idea to invest.
There are also stories in the Chinese state's media that Hong Kong's democratic activists are the minions of the Western powers that are inflaming the revolution."
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights involving 780,000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the greatest demonstrations in favour of democracy in the region.
United States Prom tradition hits UK universities: for new students private jets
We are eager to respond to the demand by establishing the first class of luxury travel in Britain for today's students.
In addition to the private aircraft, the company also offers other vehicles, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most memorable arrival to the university.
Stewart says there's also a security aspect of the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in loaded cars.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer students today as easy and high-quality as possible transportation to the university.
According to the company's representative, the reservations have not yet come because the service has just been set up, but added that "the students will start making orders in the next few weeks".
The company believes that there is a demand for the service, although most students pay GBP 9 000 per year.
Today's students are very different in terms of their expectations and wishes than they started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it's more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and the VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the national student organisation criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the higher education department, "this service plan seems to be really far removed from the lives of a majority of students".
Many of their studies this month begin to start from the level of living costs, when the financial support available in the form of loans and grants is lagging behind the huge increase in basic living costs.

In the notice, Connells describes a former meeting room as "a unique one-bedroom house".
Although the property has been removed from its website, it is still visible in advertisements.

Bulgarian prison personnel hold a national protest
Hundreds of prison workers all over Bulgaria expressed their views before the Ministry of Justice of Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted back the old work regulations, which were recently amended.
The increase is also to be discussed with Mr Hristo Ivanov, the interim Minister for Justice.

The negotiations are currently under way, and the Director General of the Directorate-General for the Enforcement of Judgments, Rosen Zhelyazkov, informed BNR.
The protest of the prison workers' organisation is also expected to be accompanied by members of the Trade Union of Workers of the Ministry of the Interior.
Basketball: Fans almost too much encouragement: Sasu Salin had passed out on the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was today an incarnation of Finland's victory.
He was able to forget about his U.S. match and reversed Ukraine's second half blood with his standing solutions.
But Salin transferred all the glory to the Sushiphanes and did it in style:
I was going to pass out at the end of that field, that encouragement was so awesome.
In the eyes, it was fogging, couldn't help it.
The noise and the white public sea were almost too much for me.
Salin's performances contained nine surfaces at a fast pace, ball-scraping, record-scraping, and templing wherever it happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into the kind of flow mode that everything worked out.
They just come out of some place, and now it's a really important place, Sasu was glowing.
It's my role.
Do all that.
Now it's great to see that the rest of you got caught up in the plan.
It took the whole gang.
The hall is a team joy pill and a spirit creature, so it is no wonder that his example raised the entire team's flight, which was too big for the five of Ukraine.
Finland in the World Cup after 32 years of break: The previous one was a gross court game
Heikki Montonen (right) was the main coach in Finland at the World Cup of Argentina in 1982.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish men’s volleyball team played the last time in the World Cup.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was the second coach in Finland and the current player-agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosone and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament yesterday: it was a hot match against France in the beginning.
"In this match's finals, the jury game was disgusting," remembered Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams were already on the back line.
All of a sudden, the game went on.
We lost it in 2-3, and then the shit went crazy," said Parkkali.
Finland played under the command of Chief Coach Heikki Montonen and was finally ranked 17th.
Now Finland is back among the world's elections, when Poland's World Championship tournament takes off today on Saturday.
Many things have changed radically in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
Players’ power values are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average length of players has also increased.
The game is faster," thought Parkkali.
But what happens in Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to continue from the beginning.
Then you can get tight," says Kosonen.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a winning match against Tunisia.
Current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup.
Let's hope this is the 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go wrong," said Parkkali.
The species legend Reino Kosonen was the second national team coach in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Kökkö fancied in the Tunisia match.
Sauna and the evening paper at the Buenos Aires Marine Church were part of the country team's programme in the World Cup in 1982.

Finnish tourists saved the Cita Dog from mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs were in trouble on Thursday in the mountains, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered themselves.
In the weekend, Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank their helpers once more.
Mikkelsen told me in a public Facebook update that the Cita-dog he was with on Thursday in the mountains hurt his feet.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in a steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to attract and pull it a little further, but its legs did not just carry, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
Mikkelsen said he didn't get help from the police, from a nearby hotel, or passers.
In the dark of the night, the situation began to appear threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini, Tampere and Tuomo, his father.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway on Galdhøpiggen and headed to their camp site when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog. Antti Soini tells me in a message she sent to Ilta-Sanom.
Soon, a German man with an expedition mattress arrived with him.
From the mattress to Cita, they got a couple of people like him, and the injured dog was attached to them.
A German man showed up for a moment after us, when we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the hill for a while, says Soini.

They were able to carry the dog down with a hike mattress.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically heavy, but it was slow to carry on a difficult terrain.
In about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still on Facebook looking for "international heroes" to thank them once more.
Sonics answered him on Sunday, but apparently the German man is still unachieved.
I don't know what I would've done without these heroes, Mikkelsen is happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't necessarily have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I don't think I've thanked them enough.
They certainly do not know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all thanks and honor, I am forever grateful to them.
The night before Monday, the Soinis were already on their way home.
They'd been getting happy to hear from Mikkelsen, and they said Cita's feeling better already!

Genetic abnormality is often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman was afraid of dying because of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth had only a few years left to live because he had another disease diagnosed.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth's disease (CMT). It means a series of hereditary diseases that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to the Charity CMT UK Approval Agency, false diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23 000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms in motorics, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and toes aggravation.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he was suffering from Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a really bad survival rate.
Rodgers believed he'd be in a wheelchair before he turned 18. And he'd die before he reached 30 years old.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two says, "When I was a kid, I knew I couldn't do the same things as everyone else.
I fell every day and took longer than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other children, and I was being bullied at school because I walked and ran differently from others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he was undergoing several axe tendon surgery to straighten his legs. When he left the room, he quickly looked at his research papers saying he was suffering from FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I checked the medical records in the library and wrote to the FA association," he says.
When I got information from them, I was shocked and in a panicous state.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I turned 25, and in the meantime I would slowly lose all my ability to function.
I went through this myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he said that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he thought and asked his doctor about it.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "Girl, I don't think you have this disease because otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from a much less dangerous illness.
According to some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was explained what a CMT disease is, I thought I'd been delayed," he says.
Charity CMT UK organises a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
A hundred immigrants were found in a coal car in Macedonia.
The Macedonian authorities have found more than one hundred illegal immigrants on a train transporting coal, the Ministry of the Interior of the country reported on Monday.
Travellers were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The migrants were found late Sunday in Venice in Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were, where they came from and where they were going," said Ivo Koteski, an informant from the Ministry of the Interior.
According to the police, the migrants had paid around EUR 3 000 each to get to Greece and an additional EUR 800-900 to get to Serbia.
Illegal immigrants go through a couple of million people in Macedonia on their way to Western Europe.
There have already been three million people running from the bloody civil war in Syria.

Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of beach land to Bottaks - a value of approximately EUR 60000
The municipality government of Nastola donated a formula driver to Valtter Bottak 1.4 hectares of beach plot from Villävi, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
The government showed a fair sense of sport and was unanimous in its decision.
The sora sounds were not heard at the meeting when the plot was decided, says the mayor Pauli Syrakk.
There are seven buildings on Bottaksen's gift house.
The municipality will take them down this year, except one.
Bottas has promised to build a leisure apartment on the property within two years.
We are impressed that he has enjoyed his birthright and wants to continue to be here.
The Valter has been to elementary school every year to tell about his sports career and his life.
And hopefully it will continue, says the mayor.
The local manager estimates the financial value of the beach property at EUR 40000-60000.
The beach is low and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for over ten years.
Over the decades, Nastola has maintained success in sports through gift plots in the municipality with varying successes.
World champion Aki Parviainen and world master of aerobics Tuuli Matinsalo received the home plots from the municipality and built the silly houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastola but sold their property and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalo came to Nastola for work and then changed the situation when they changed.
Bottas is a native Nastolian and his situation is different, Syria is nuanced and believes Bottak to remain in his home state.
The madman washed the attacker with a record of Hernandez's company.
Vaoliigatura Hull invested the record amount of the club in the acquisition of Abel Hernandez, a country team member of Uruguay.
Hernandez will change the Italian Society from Palermo to Hull by GBP 9.5 million, i.e. some EUR 12 million.
The contract is three years old.
Hernandez hit 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and went to Italy.
In Uruguay, he's scored seven goals in 14 matches.
Last summer's World Cup Hernandez came in two matches from changing to the field.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time, said Hull's chief coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull also told me that he had acquired Senegal’s national team captain, Mohammed Diamen, from West Ham.
The Russian space test failed - the gypsies sent on a sex trip died
Five small genies sent to Russia to breed into space are dead, says the Russian Federation's space organization Roscosmos in its release.
Geoks traveled on a Photo-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
Satellite returned to the country on Monday morning for Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to examine the reproductive potential and use of the gel in a non-weight state.
One male and four female were involved in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds extraordinary, its purpose was serious.
The impact of weight loss on, for example, the development of eggs in game is limited.
The impact on the gecks can be anticipated to anticipate the impact of unweightness on a person while he is staying in a longer-term state, illustratedly in the New Statesman in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death and the cause or cause of death of the geckos will be determined.
According to the news agency Interfax, the passengers who were baptized "sex-geeks" were frozen.
Surprisingly, the fruit flies that traveled on the same Photon-M4 ride survived the journey and also gained after-growth.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice Airport.
France arrested a suspected terrorist at Nice Airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of working as a recruiter for a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities informed the Commission on Sunday.
The authorities were able to track him after he had been able to attract a 16-year-old girl with money to go to Syria.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and then cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl’s explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl’s father, who was completely ignorant of her daughter’s intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, he is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had already followed the man's actions.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that radicalising young people who are attracted to the Iraq or Syria wars pose a security risk for France as well.
The authorities estimate that some 800 French citizens or people in French books have traveled to, returned from, or are planning to leave for Syria during the last conflict.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The wishes of the basketball team for the next place will be at stake when Finland will meet Ukraine in the second match of the World Cup today.
If the opening loss for the United States had been expected, Ukraine will belong to the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe we have a good chance at victory, Mr Koponen predicts.
On Saturday, Ukraine defeated the Dominican Republic 72-62 in its first match.
The team is trained by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, who is commanded by Ukraine to play aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is the game leader Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a world champion from three years ago.
Jeter threw 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter's quick guy, but we've been playing against those before, and we need to get our standard defense in place, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than last night's loss to the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can assure you, a normal pack of wolves will be seen on the field, Möttölä said.
Allegedly, the Hollywood stars are spreading online - some of them confirmed as authentic
A number of naked images are spreading on the Internet, which are claimed to present well - known public figures.
Among other things, actress Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of the "pig campaign".
The entertainment site TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence’s representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a gross violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) images stolen by Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, and representatives will be threatened.
According to TMZ, the actor Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images spreading from her are genuine.
She had taken those pictures years ago with her husband.
When I know that those images were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a terrible effort was seen for this.
I feel compassion for everyone who was the victim of hacking, he writes according to the site.
On the other hand, acting Victoria Justice says fake pictures in her own name.
There are also genuine or counterfeit naked photos of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka goalie criticizes his own people: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here."
Football club FC Honka is currently in the final position of the Veikkausliiga.
After the VPS game on Sunday, the goalkeeper Walter Viitas's comments describe the complex state of the society.
I haven't had a goalie coach in four months.
But everything needs to be adjusted," Viitala said after the battle that ended in 1-2-loss.
Honka made a lot of mistakes in the game, especially during the first half.
The goalkeeper Viitala wasn't happy about playing defense.
Player traffic in Hong Kong has been busy this summer, and that is why defenders in front of Viita have also changed rapidly.
With the player’s roulette, many young players have also received opportunities that they may not even deserve.
"Part of it doesn't work hard enough to get out of here sometimes," Viitala was incinerated without appointing any single player.
Honga’s head coach Shefki Kuqi was somewhat in agreement with Viita.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to practice and games to have fun and you think you're a betting league player and you don't have to work, you're probably in the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people game time.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of it, it's not my fault.
Kuqi also recalled, however, that players cannot be expected to succeed immediately as players continue to change.
This period has not had the same composition twice in a row.
Especially in the head of defense, people have changed.
That is the main reason why we are in this position," Kuqi said.
After the VPS loss, the Honka is a series jumbo, at the same time as the last TPS.
There are still seven more rounds left in the Veterinarian League, so there is still time to avoid falling to Number One.
I've never dropped a team before, and I'm not going to drop a team now.
We're not really going to fall out of this show," goalie Viitala said.
Lars von Trier making a TV series after decades of break
Film director Lars von Trier plans to return to being the author of TV series.
The Danish director is preparing a TV show called The House That Jack Build.

Lars von Trier, 58, has been known in recent years for his ominous media performances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
In the 1990s, he directed the Kingdom series to television.

This Ice Bucket challenge ended in a painfully bad way.
She's been taken to treatment since she screamed at the Ice Bucket challenge while she was performing so hard that her jaw was dislocated.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so loud when ice cold water was poured on her that she damaged the structure of her face.
"Your water was so cold that I just screamed, but when I screamed, I felt my jaw started to stiffen," she told The Mirror.
The ice water is poured over a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts just before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and my sisters noticed the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to be assigned to emergency care.
A 20-year-old Britishman who took part in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday was taken to a hospital where the jaw was put back in place.
The video clip has become an Internet sensation and has been distributed thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The angle of the wolf’s howling (also): How can the increase in fan count be explained?
Today was a hell of a night's work.
So said basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, when Finland had played in the final EM tournament against France at the Athens Marouss Ball Hall.
He wasn't exaggerating.
I remember the game when you were there.
So were about one hundred Finns who cried out for 20 000 viewers, otherwise in empty halls.
I wonder what Pehkonen would have said 19 years later after the World Cup in Finland-Ukraine.
In Bilbao there are eighty times as many as a hundred Finnish fans.
The EMs 1995 was the lead time for Finnish basketball.
The men paved their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, at the Russian screening match at the Helsinki Sports House.
That victory opened the doors to Europe's cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann took Möttölä to the final tournament team on the lime lines.
The solution, many of which disagreed.
Now it can be said that Dettmann was far-fetched, even though everything did not go according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
In the Athens Games, a total of just over 100 Finns were known to be present.
It included journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaching and a few fans.
Bilbao also has journalists, relatives, and trainers, but there are fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
I'm sure no one can say the exact number of Finnish rivals.
Estimates have moved between 7 500 and 10,000.
No matter what the number between those two is, it's an inexplicable amount.
Here's an explanation for sports sociologists.
In a global economy, businesses cross borders.
There's still a chance in sport to look at how we're doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can watch our girls and boys succeed in the world, says Hannu Itkonen, professor of sports sociology.
There are certainly Finns in both Spain and the World Cup of Volleyball in Poland who are applying for an experience.
It's a shared experience.
But that doesn't explain everything.
There's got to be a lot of attraction in sports.
Itkonen brings sport into the popular culture.
It's a lower threshold to go to sports events than Berlin to watch art.
But without success, the masses can't be triggered.
Let's get back to 1995.
That's when Chief Coach Dettmann challenged the basketball league and the players to throw themselves at top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed, and the country team was raised to the ground.
The volleyball team made the same move a little earlier.
Now they're both enjoying the fruits of the job.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top sport, where the sacred Trinity works: sports media sponsors.
Then the audience will also be interested.
And the media has taught us what such carnivalist support is, Itkonen reminds us.
Can the species of balloons transfer this massive interest also to the home series?
At basketball and volleyball, the average number of players is hundreds or a little over a thousand.
The question is considered to be a good one, and it does not necessarily give an answer that promises very good to the species.
Another school believes that interest will be transferred.
The other one is the one who doesn't want a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, domestic series are not two-fold interested.
It's a challenge for the people in the middle of the drug.
Confirmation of Bottaksen plot - almost 1.5 hectares by the lake
Nastola is rewarded by a formula driver at the beach house of Valtter Bottaksen.
The municipal government unanimously approved the release of a 1 4 ha plot at its meeting on Monday.
There will be a leisure apartment on the property in the future.
Bottak's success has been monitored in Nastola since the time of his mapping.
He's being tried as an ambassador to market Lahti, Lahti, and Nastola.
The gift house is located in Koiskala, on Lake Kärkjärvi.
It has come to the ownership of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate sale.
The area has seven depot buildings, six of which will be demolished by the end of this year.
Bottas won Formula 1 in the Belgium semifinal this year.
He's on the fifth in the MM.
Bottas is a native Nastolian and lived in Villähe, his childhood.
He lives in England today, but he goes to Nastola every time he's free from formulas.
Bottas has visited upper secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design-intelligent clothes come in, but hardly for the poor.
It will present and test them at the U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirt testers are the ball people in the field, but also the amateur Marcus Giron, one of the tops of the university players, thinks that.
According to him, the shirt helps him to follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors have been woven into the shirt, which transmits the information to the cell phone on the shirt and from there to the smartphone or flat-screen computer.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rate, stress, and step.
Before throwing a shirt into the washing machine, the moculature acting as the central unit shall be removed.
The fashion house has not told us exactly the time to start selling a shirt, nor have it even hinted at the price, according to Tech Times.
Raph Lauren is not the only firm that invests in smart clothes.
Californian Athos has brought in the smart shirt and the smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost $100 apiece and the central unit the size of the thumb they require costs $2 hundred.

A Smart Way to Save Textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so soon Matt Schroeder, starting his second year of study, discovered a smart way to save costs.
He developed a system in which students at later annual courses borrow their books for nominal compensation instead of selling the books forward at once.
"My book on mathematics would normally have cost 180 dollars; I paid $10 for the entire semester and a thousand sandwiches," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying at Covant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says that his last semester's books would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the Board of Directors of the University, the average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeder idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, in which case they can use the book throughout the semester and pay for it clearly less than the students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, a company operating over 250 campus books, the renting of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistical data in this field reveal that about a quarter of the books on university bookshops were rental books in the last spring," says Trevor Meyer, President of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus booksellers.
Here's the simplest way to save a lot of money.
Online shops
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained by a third of the price it would cost at the campus bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" book is almost $290, but Chegg.com's specialty books online buys $239.99.
Buy Used
The books used are a good option if the reader does not interfere with other notes and worn appearance.
For example, the "Calculus" book is used by Chegg.com for $93.49.
The last year student of Brigham Young University, Matt Casaday, 25 years old, reports that he bought a book entitled "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" using Amazon.com for only $0.42.
The new book would have cost you $48.
The head of the Amherst's College Without Walls School at the University of Massachusetts, Ingrid Bracey and other academics recommend that students ask their professors whether previous editions can be used in the course.
At times, reforms in the new edition are not essential for teaching.
In this case, an old edition can only be found by a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookshops, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
It is worth considering renting the textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after you complete the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80 per cent of the price of a new book.
For example, renting the "Calculus" book for the entire semester costs about $20.
Please refer to the rules of the rental company, such as notes, the use of the highlighting pen and the wear-out of the following charges.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the book purchase price.
E-mails
Getting e-books instead of ordinary paperwork can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are rented, when they are paid out for the right of use of the e-book to its holder, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg's store gives you a "Calculus" e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literature students save the most because many classics can be downloaded for free today, while science and technology books can be very expensive.
Comparing different sellers is worth it, which option will be chosen.
Joe Gault, 29, which is about to start in Pepperdine law, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the price, as it will help to ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before ordering from the network, make sure the book is definitely in stock, Gaul says.
He himself learned through this heel.
The delivery of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually had to obtain the book at full cost from the University Bookshop.

Almost double the number of people killed in the fires compared to last year
This year, nearly double the number of people killed in the fires compared to last year.
According to the media monitoring of the Finnish Civil Protection Agency (Spek), 55 people have already died in 49 different fires.
At the same time last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over the age of 65.
According to the organisation's statistics on fire deaths, the worst situation was in 2009, when 64 people had died in the fires by the end of August.
Most of the fire deaths happen in apartments.
There have been 17 deaths in flats, 21 in private houses and seven in row and other small houses.
Spec reminds me of repeating home fire safety.
At least all fire detectors in the home should be able to operate according to Spec.
In addition, everyone should check that the means of starting fire extinguishers are easily available.
There must also be an accessible exit route from all the premises of the home.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they can use when they are at home alone.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO Summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city center of Newport for a march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people met at Cardiff City Hall at the so - called counter-conference summit.
Stephen Fairlough followed events this weekend and spoke to protestors who had arrived even from Belgium.
Young people were saved by air from the blue mountains of Australia
Two teenage hikers were taken to safety after nights stuck in the Blue Mountains in the New South Wales area of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a trip to Govets Leap on Sunday after noon to Blackheat.
Family were concerned about young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8:00 p.m.
A search party, composed of local police and helpers, was sent to look for young people, and the twins were found around 2 p.m. near the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and hit her head.
The cops spent the night with a couple, and they were taken to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk Airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk Airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, soldiers were ordered to withdraw.
According to Ukraine, paratroopers have been vehemently engaged with Russian tanks in the field.
According to the military representative, the opponent's gunfire has been so careful that Russian professional soldiers are likely to be the shooter.
Seven Ukrainian soldiers have died in the past 24 hours.
The Ukrainian patrol ship, which received artillery shares yesterday outside of South-East Ukraine, sank in the morning, says the border guard.
Eight marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard had no assurance of where the ship was shot.
The Separatists already told me that they shot the ship yesterday in the social media.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that the Ukrainian troops should immediately withdraw from stations from which they could not fire civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, an immediate ceasefire should be achieved in the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE without conditions.
Mr Lavrov also pointed out that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
Firstly, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
The heavy rains caused Malmö and Copenhagen to flood
The streets flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen on Sunday, when heavy rains struck southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floods cut off several roads, mixed traffic, and buried cars.
On Sunday, the authorities estimated that it might take some time for the flood to stop, even though the rain was projected to stop on Monday.
The heavy rains came as a surprise to the Swedish authorities, and no weather warning was given for the rains in advance.
The meteorologist Ari Mustala, who is on-call at the Finnish Institute of Weather, estimates that the rainfall in the region was very local.
The rainfall looks narrow and steady.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French socialists should "be quiet and help France", the main supporter of Francois Hollande says
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show its feelings for a socialist president in difficulty, whose composition did not allow the majority of the French to be accepted.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay with him," Valls said and deserved applause.
As a satisfactory gesture, the Prime Minister asked the Government to leave the French controversial 35-hour working week despite the proposal previously made by the new Minister of Economic Affairs Emmanuel Macron this week, which raised the debate, that the rule should be softened.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to work together with the government.
However, the Minister of Justice Christiane Taubira caused a dissent by appearing at the meeting of the socialists who expressed differing views and criticising the Socialist Party for allowing 'France to give up hope for the future'.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the nationalistist front, mocked the continuing disunity of the Socialists and said that he did not believe that the new government of Valls would last a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but so has Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the previous one could not last even during the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen said to the journalists.
He repeated his party's proposal to break up the parliament and held the party's election victory in an early election, and he himself would be prepared to run the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the extreme right held a list of the EU elections in May.
According to the opinion poll of the Journal du Dimanche, published on Sunday, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break down into several competing groups before the Dutch period ends in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political researcher at Po University, warned that the French would soon lose their patience if the new socialist government did not succeed in improving the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly notice that change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get worse.
Pokka failed Morning Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda failed badly in the recording section of the program.
Last Thursday, the morning Finnish program released a funny video of the recordings made on Thursday on its Facebook page.
In the video, directors Kirsi Alm-Sira and Nina Rahkola as well as meteorologist Pekka Pouta will try to record Morning on the next day's broadcast of the Finnish Advertising Puffet, but the recording is not going very well.
Alm-Sira goes crazy in her words when she tries to say the word "budget", and her confusion also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their dicks once and for all.
And these heroes should be allowed to pull the live broadcast tomorrow, says the morning's Facebook update in Finland.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the image office of the magazine, was third in a series of pots in 1972.
The picture shows Israel's Prime Minister, Golda Meir.
A meeting of the International Socialist Assembly was held in Fredrikinkatu, Helsinki, in May 1971.
There were a lot of Heads of State at the meeting, and security was huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with him.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had plenty of five minutes to take the picture.
I took this picture in four and a half feet.
The light and the background were right.
I immediately realized I did it this time.
From the look of the Meier, we can see that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
At that time the competition was successful with the images taken of known persons or events.
It is great that you can also succeed with other images as long as you have an idea and a visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's fall picture of the Munich Olympics.
That's not what I sent to the competition.
Claims: Aarnio research has already paid more than EUR 5 million
The study of the legality of the activities of the Finnish police unit in Helsinki has already cost more than EUR 5 million and has required 30-50 years of work.
In this way, Jyr Rajamäki assessed the information technology for the University of Jyväskylä in his claim work.
Rajamäki suggests that the control of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved through the combination of IT systems for investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables multi-use of forensic material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected to investigate the crime is automatically electronic evidence satisfying the chain of evidence and, at the same time, allows for comprehensive law enforcement.
The argument will be checked on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetable food was forgotten on the school's wall: "Foods and chickens belonging to the caviar"
The picture of a special news report on the wall of the Pirkkala Women’s Travel School caused food shortages in social media, says Yle on her website.
Vegetarians!
Fish and chicken dishes at school lunch at the vegetable diet.
Only when there's meat on the list will we make a vegetable alternative!
This is the case in a 15 - year - old newsletter that has been forgotten on the school wall.
I'll let you take a look at the picture from here.
The picture in social media has caused people to send feedback to Pirkkala municipality.
Arja Vaarma, head of the food and cleaning service, says to Yle that the note forgotten on the wall is not correct and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came, there has sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed with healthcare in the past.
Each student receives a meal in accordance with his wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are offered a choice of vegetarians only with the permission of their parents and with a certificate from a doctor or nurse on a herbal diet.
The danger justifies the solution to Yle by the fact that young people’s vegetarian experiments may leave the diet inadequate and the lack of meat or chicken can be a source of wonder to students’ parents.
Norwegian Cruise worth nearly $3 billion for Prestige Cruise
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, is negotiating to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for $3 billion.
With the trade, Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of $6.8 billion, would have the luxury cruisers and wealthy customers of Prestige Cruises as it continued to compete against the Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to sources, information on a possible agreement may already be published this week, but it is also possible that negotiations will not produce any results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 % of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want their names to be made public, because negotiations are not open to the public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not reply to the requests for comments and the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company from Miami has 13 cruise ships, the route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean America and the Caribbean.
Its net sales increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, when net sales amounted to USD 2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which operates from Miami as well, sails under the names of the Oceania and Regent brands, including a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise in emerging economies, such as the Chinese and Indian middle classes.
Companies are competing to become the first option for these new customers when choosing cruises.
Prestige Cruises will register its first issue of shares on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has held most of the company’s shares since the sale in 2007, worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was established in 2000 in its current composition after its merger with the Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. The latter is the entertainment and casino company of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise listed itself as a public company in January 2013.
According to the information published, Genting's share of the company was 28 %, Apollo's 20 %, and TPG Capital LP's share was 8 % from the end of June.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise companies is 82% of North American cruise capacity, as shown in the registration document published by Prestige Cruise in connection with the issue of shares.
The Tampere City Council will discuss this today.
It calls on the City Council to give firm support to the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animation, the doctoral thesis preparing for Tampere University, during the dolphinries in Finland and around the world, there is a reason to end quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, it has become common view that the maintenance of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphins is neither animal protection nor ethically sustainable.
This view would also like to see Tampere taken on board.
The abolition of the dolphinry is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question of the image of Tampere as a tourist destination, says Tuomivaara.
According to the conviction, the death of Näsi dolphin confirms the requirements for a de-description of dolphin activity.
The death of Näsi is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Sääkönniemi dolphinarium.
It is time to put a stop to the deaths, close the dolphin prison, and begin to find out how to move the dolphins in Tampere to a restricted sea area, to a kind of dolphin shelter, the Tuomivaara requires.
Näsi did not have time to return to the original environment of dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living on the Sääränniemi would have had more time to experience than their unintended concrete, Tuomivaara hopes.
The Animal Conservation Union The purpose of the Animal Protection Union is to ban the use of all wild species in circuses in the overall reform of the Animal Protection Act.
This includes dolphins.
In support of the request, the executive director of the Animalia, Tuomivaara, is taking part in the 1.9. campaign on behalf of the dolphins.
The demonstration of the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki takes a stand against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, approximately 2,300 dolphins, either for the use of dolphins or for food, are brutally imprisoned or killed each year.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations on a new country with Eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted on Sunday that the Ukrainian government put an end to the fight against separatists in the east of the country and immediately open negotiations on the "statehood" of a region that is different, according to Russian news sources.
His representative Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their own rights and interests.
The request made by Putin to the Government of Kiev to negotiate with the Russian rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his apparent strategy since the violence began five years ago: he seeks to help separatists to take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian Government to grant the newly declared Novorossian independence to Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 TV channel Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian army to retake back the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region controlled by separatists, whose separatists took over in March and April after Moscow joined the Ukrainian Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently baptized the region "Novorospaja", "New Russia" – this term is similar to the days of glory preceding the revolutions of the Russian empire.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace talks are a 'indulgence' as long as Ukrainian politicians carry out campaigns for the parliamentary elections to be held on 26 October, and the government forces are attacking civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We must begin without delay wide-ranging negotiations, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the South-East Ukrainian state, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to 'statehood' is linked to the wider independence that has been discussed with the Kiev leadership for months in its attempt to dispel the fears of the Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, says Peskov.
There is no debate on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, says Peskov, 'because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict between Ukraine'.
Mr Putin's statement, which was intended to correct the 'false interpretation' of Putin's comments, stressed that the Russian regime was dealing with the rebellion of separatists in the eastern regions in a different way from that of Crimea, when in practice it took over an area whose population of 2 million people is ethnically Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to include even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and because, according to pre-conflict opinion polls, the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give the Ukrainian local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin, in practice, in an area that links Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is located in Russia's main fleet and commercial seaports and historical coastal sites.
In the area between Rostov and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and metal smelting plants that produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, should consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions outside the Ukrainian core area on their own economy and on the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of the Separatists who may have been armed and flamed by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his latest demand to the Government of Kiev for negotiations with the Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week following the invasion of Russian tanks and troops into Eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful region along the Azov coast.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that taking over the city of Novoazovski, supported by Russian separatists, will be the start of a greater effort to take over the entire strategically important coastal area to Crimea.
It has led to the massive strengthening of the Mariupoli city by civilians and military personnel. The half a million inhabitants of Mariupol are known as the steel-producing port city between Novoazovski and the narrow land leading to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Mr Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels asking for further measures to prevent future violations of Russia in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point where there is no return," said Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders proposed additional sanctions to be introduced if the crisis in Ukraine re-emerged in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw their positions in the territory of Ilovaiski after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers moved to Donetsk last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told journalists on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers on the island of Russia in Ilovaisk was replaced by 10 Russian paratroopers who were imprisoned in the Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Milan's opening painting was made by Japanese warrior Keisuke Honda for the seventh minute of the game.
In the second half, Sulley Muntar first hit, and a little later Jeremy Menez was punished.
Laziok got a heavyweight at the end of the game, but goalie Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan this season from Real Madrid.
In the training debut of Milan's former assailant inzagh, San Siro's stadium was only half-way.
The audience of the match was announced as 39 000 viewers.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in the spin of the nude photo scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he may be shocked by hackers who may have stolen his fiancée and Hollywood's A-list star Gabi Grecko's naked photos.
In the entertainment world, there has been a pile of nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet as a result of a major celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker has been told to have a total of 60 naked photos of the star Lawrence, and other superstars, such as the top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingnes, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actor Kirsten Dunst.
Also pictures of the Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko in Melbourne have apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, said to the Confidential magazine, "This is disgusting."
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
