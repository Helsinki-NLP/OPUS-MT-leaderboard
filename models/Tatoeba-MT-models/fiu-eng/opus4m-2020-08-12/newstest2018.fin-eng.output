Camille Auer wanted to fix her sex, was diagnosed as a mental illness, and now she's doing art on the subject, "Man should have the right to his own body."
There are dozens of patient reports hanging from the roof of the Project Room Gallery.
Every one of them says Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a multi-annual story about how outside people have written down their interpretations of Auer and his identity.
They decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell a person about my immediate medical history so that the violence of the process could be seen," Auer says.
In the process, he refers to a sexual correction process.
It is often a year-long study period that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process is launched by means of a transmission to the diagnostic studies of "gender identity disorder" carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before that, he had used the estrogen he ordered via the Internet and was already very long in his own repair process.
She felt that she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must undergo a process of correction in order to be able to correct the sex legally.
The Transleg, i.e. the law on the establishment of the gender of transsek sual (563/2002), obliges transgender people to be forced into compulsory sterilisation in order to obtain the right sex, for example, at the Population Register Centre and passport.
At the moment, each of his or her sexes is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of inability to reproduce.
A person has the right to decide his own body.
"This situation is unacceptable and violates human rights," says Auer.
The reform of the Translaw has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has adopted eight comments to the law and there is a preliminary ruling in the European Court of Human Rights which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared a change to the law under the leadership of Susanne Huovinen, then Minister of Social Affairs and Health.
The elections came and the Finns of Peru rose to the government.
Now the law is stuck again.
It is a matter of internal political disputes which do not even have to do with this law.
"The administration does not want to put it on the table because there are differences within the government about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, CEO of Amnesty's Finnish Department.
The front of the exhibition room is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of packages and instructions for use of Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read for example the interpretation of the Transpolitic Psychologist at Tampere University Hospital in Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice, and based on these, she wrote a report that would define the treatment of Auer’s law and the provision of assistance.
The consciousness of the reality under investigation appears to be exposed to degenerateness.
The perception of the subject himself is shown in a way that is fragmented at the border level, and the unstable characteristics associated with personality are highlighted.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness," Auer says.
There was an even greater shock when Auer was not given treatment for sexual refurbishment.
According to the nursing staff, his resources were not sufficient to begin the process.
He was denied his own identity.
On 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked out the waiting hall of the Transpol.
Later, a work of art called Monument for the Exclusive was created on television, where Auer reflects his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone identified as a woman in birth can magnify their breasts, but they need diagnosis to remove breasts," says Auer.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are other than the number of your sex defined in birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one.
The gender correction process is more severe for many mental reasons than purely medical operations.
Its pervades meet dozens of people who need to be justified on their own existence and right to their own sexual experience.
"It is crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment, claiming that their resources are not enough," says Auer.
Many people who have applied for the process have a history of psychiatric symptoms: depression, anxiety, and possible bullying experiences.
On this basis, the medical staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be initiated.
"The prevention of treatment and assistance can put a person in an even worse position than it was before the process began," says Auer.
Auer’s own exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the publication Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that is something that people usually find difficult to melt".
Depression has been treated with medications and when Auer started using hormones, it made you feel better.
She had finally been able to express the feelings that had existed since childhood and teens.
Why the wide jaw did not seem to fit into its own body and why the breast muscle had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer is that there are people near him who see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify so much by talking, dress, sound, and movement," he says.
Today Auer feels he's already seen, he exists as a woman.
At the beginning of the process, however, the random comments of those close to you may have hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when close relatives are abused.
"They should know who I am, and they know who I am, but they won't be able or able to internalize it," he continues.
However, not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, it is not possible to obtain official confirmation of their sex.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," says Auer.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right of self-determination in relation to the legal sex.
A full-time applicant submits a written application for a new identity card, stating that he or she feels that he or she is a different sex.
After a period of six months, the applicant shall confirm his application in writing and the Ministry shall give the applicant a new identification number.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland and this requirement is also covered by the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist, but an exhibition is a political and artistic collection.
I want to believe that art is still of great importance and that it can bring about political changes at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The civil society organisation issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP for African-American Civil Rights has issued a travel warning on Missouri, due to the discriminatory practices of the state and the racist attacks that took place there.
"The NACP's travel notice for Missouri will enter into force on 28 August 2017, and it calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling to a state which has recently experienced a number of questionable racial events", the Organization's Communication states.
The law recently in force in Missouri makes it difficult to export cases of discrimination to the law, and the implementation of the state's laws is disproportionate to minorities, which according to the NAACP led to the issuing of a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of skin color and abused or killed," said Rod Chapel, President of NAACP, to Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of as many cases in a short time."
The travel notice for Missouri is the first warning for the State of the United States of America.
For example, the organisation mentioned racist comments against African-American students at Missouri University and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year, and he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and Missouri police arrested him, even though he wasn't charged with a crime.
The travel notice also referred to a report by Missouri Minister of Justice that the police are more likely to stop a black driver than a white one.
"The purpose of the travel notice is to encourage people to be alerted and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," says Chapel.
"People must prepare themselves, for example, by involving money for bail payments or by telling relatives that they intend to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, in 2015 there were 100 hate crimes recorded in Missouri, the sixteenth most in the United States.
Travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for companies to challenge to the law against discrimination in housing and employment.
The ACLU, a civil society organisation guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona following the adoption of immigration laws which oblige the police to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the organisation, will increase racial profiling.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concern other countries, but have recently been published by NGOs in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair to report on the additional pension of the CEO
Mika Lintilä, Minister of Economic Affairs responsible for State Management, has asked Finnair for a statement on the supplementary pension contribution received by Pekka Vauramo, CEO of the airline, says.
According to the Minister, it is incompatible with the expression of the State's will.
The additional pension of EUR 130 000 received by Vauramo emerged this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration of the directors of listed companies.
The Finnish Kuvalehtiht newsed about Vararamo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said that he would give up additional pensions in 2013.
The State has directed not to use additional pensions for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the principle decision on ownership management last year.
Penalties immediately tightened up speech
Some time ago it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on the way from cold to warm.
In the context of the G20 meeting in Hamburg, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to be working well together.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions adopted by the U.S. Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were counterproductive in Russia.
The most shocking answer has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, according to which the sanctions signed by Trump are a 'full-scale trade war'.
Even if the Russian reactions were only in the form of political upheavals and excesses, the tightening between the United States and Russia is a fact after the honeymoon month after the choice of a short Trump.
In the United States, the transit of sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Although the Congress adopted the law with considerable unanimity, it was much more difficult for the President to adopt the law, as told.
So Trump criticises the law he signed recently as "a significant flaw".
President Trump's beating must have been due to Russia in particular, although the adoption of a law restricting its own powers must have been abhorrent.
As is well known, there is an investigation in the United States of Russia's possible involvement in the presidential elections as well as Trump's campaign on Russia's connections.
The tightening between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
As the staff of the White House has changed to a lot and various scandalous turns have been revealed almost updated, it seems increasingly obvious that foreign policy is not conducted in the United States under the leadership of the President, but in spite of the President.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If Russia is a chimurant in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region in the Baltic Sea is also tightening relations.
The EU has made a prominent contribution to the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained at least one side of its Russian policy, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State that trades a lot with Russia, such as Finland, economic sanctions have been a real problem.
The effects of the recent US Penalty Act are still unclear.
In the EU, it has been feared that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of liquid natural gas, which is important for the US economy, for example.
Trade sanctions are a means of showing contempt in world politics.
However, economic sanctions must be well-considered and rigorous.
Otherwise, they will easily be more harmful than useful.
Nothing's sacred anymore?
The Trump White House now has its aim in the statue of Freedom
Being involved in the statues is certainly a sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqis, together with the American soldiers, poured down Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologists of the Trump regime, knew well what was going on in the fierce debate with Jim Acosta of CNN. The statue of freedom was attacked by Miller in the war of words on the President's proposal to reduce legal immigration considerably.
Miller wasn't exactly criticizing the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by the huge flocks of cruisers and by the characters that imitate the statue of freedom.
The object of his attack was the significance of the statue, and in particular the addition in 1903 of Emma Lazarus’ poem — 17 years after completion of the statue.
This is how Miller set Acosta: "I don't want to go further into history now, but the statue of freedom is... a symbol of the American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was not wrong in himself, but it is not just about history, as he himself said.
The key are the touching words of Lazarus, the only kind in which the state not only calls immigrants but "the poorest": "Your chosen, your poor, / Your huddled masses years to break free," / The written reply of your theme location."
The poem is now more relevant than ever.
At least Miller did not conduct the criticism of literature, and he made it clear that "the poorest of the poor" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The dispute about the importance of the Statue of Freedom is part of a broader political and cultural dispute about the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus’ friends campaigned for the poem to be attached to the statue, and they knew well that the act was a strong political one.
The purpose of the statue was to express the links between French and American Republicism by a classic symbol, the female incarnation of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female character is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the deported.
The inclusion of the poem in the image was a brilliant feminist coup d'état and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
Rush Limbaugh, a mouthpiece who can now be regarded as some kind of a prophecy about Trump, claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not call anyone, but is an early forerunner of the neoconservatives, who takes the U.S. torch to cover the world with darkness: "Lady Liberty comes out.
He takes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch doesn't show the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The importance of the statue of freedom depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the ship’s deck after a long and trialsome journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people seeking a better life.
His statue of freedom is comforted by giving hope and welcoming welcome.
And that's not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torch doesn't show the way, but it burns the flames of anger, their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilith Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots got into the British country team.
Neil Black, the performance director of the UK General Sports Association, says that the 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Championships are "a significant confirmation".
On Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for the World Cup of Sports in London.
According to Black, there is something special going on in Scotland, which is what British sports must learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it for so long that we understand what it is," says Black.
"I had a conversation with representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sports, and they thought it had something to do with the Institute's activities.
On the other hand, the Scottish sports association believes it has something to do with the Union's activities,
and the British sports association believes that it is behind their activities.
And the usual street manager thinks he's got something to do with it.
But this is something absolutely awesome, which is why it is."
Many Scottish athletes are seriously competing in London for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah at a speed of 5,000 metres. Eilith Doyle was elected as the leader of the national team.
"Elidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly amazing," says Black.
"The athletes left the opportunity proud of their achievements and were strongly motivated, regardless of where they happened to live and practice.
Elidh's words had a genuine feeling and passion for sport."
Eilith Doyle is the silver medalist at the National Community Championships in a 400-metre fence race, and these are his fifth world championship. He thinks it is "unbelievable" that there are 16 Scots on the national team.
The previous record was seven years in 1983 and 2015.
The mid-distance runner Laura Muir has been running five British and two European records during the year.
He's competing in London for 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs 1 500 meters in London. He is also worth keeping an eye on him: he has an excellent season behind him, including winnings in the UK World Championships and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first world championship, when Lee McConnell was the only Scottish in the country team.
The captain of the national team says he's "much proud" of the fact that there are so many Scots involved, some of which are seriously competing for the finals and medals.
"Access to become a captain is a great honour anyway, but even more so because the members of the national team voted for the captain," Doyle says.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who got into the country team.
It shows how far we've come.
They will be involved as well-deserved athletes competing for prizes.
My Captain's speech?
I thought it went well.
I was focused on how lucky we are when we've got the homecomings.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there, and I know that the atmosphere is going to be amazing."
Preventing critics on Facebook: Don't stand up for public office if you can't stand criticism
Our country's father knew what a bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticise him for all possible domestic politics, always according to his political principles.
I'm sure the criticism was annoying.
But he didn't silence his critics.
"If the freedom of speech is removed, we may be led dumb and silent as sheep for slaughter," said Washington in 1783.
That's how we get to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and prevented their performers.
The U.S. Civil Rights Union sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge to be unfounded, and his attitude was also undermining on the Internet.
"What difference does it make? This is just Facebook," many comment.
But it matters.
especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican Governor of the Democratic State.
He has received the second best estimates of his activities among the 50 governors.
Hogan's not sensitive to the hottie.
He has firmly led the state and firmly adhered to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main channel of communication for his voters and published a picture of his baldened head in chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking users coming to the Governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum that his staff maintains with tax assets.
Mr. Hogan's informant Amelia Chase defended the governor's actions in his interview with the Washington Post.
However, it is too easy to label commentators as trolls, messengers or haters.
Washington Post interviewed users who were blocked on Hogan's Facebook.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors.
They told us that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and thoughtful.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comments; he wanted to appeal to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland's Bowie was not hostile but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I was politely disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crime and other recent news," he wrote in the comments of the Washington Post news.
"I also cannot accept that, when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately considered to be an organized group of people and, as a large group, ignore concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments a "central attack".
During the Facebook era, communication is easy to control by preventing a critic or removing a critical comment.
In ancient times, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical headlines, or to arrest and silence protestors.
However, it is actually the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first significant decision on the subject was taken last week in Virginia.
According to James C. Cacheris, judge of the District Court of Alexandria, the Loudoun county government violated the first addition to the U.S. Constitution by preventing a voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Association came to discuss the use of Twitter and Facebook with the Republican Governor of Kentucky.
This shouldn't be difficult.
At the time of Washington, cheap postal charges had a similar effect to today’s Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers were embroiling Washington.
There were trolls back then.
Names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters in the newspapers in which they were barking at Washington’s decisions.
The President's Office received petitions criticising Jay's agreement, namely the Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement between the United States and Britain, which is reflected in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
But he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of discussion are the fundamental stones of our nation.
True leadership means acceptance of this fact.
Summer bird feeding should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about half a dozen places, and also from a couple, three online announcements.
Most of them have come from South and South Finland, but also from Haapavede and Seinäjoki, specialist researcher Marja Isomursu from Evira.
Green blankets have died of a parasitic disease called tricomonosis.
It's caused by a scientific animal called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to hit pigeons, especially pigeons.
In the 21st century, however, the disease was also detected in the trophies.
In 2009, it was a very good year.
At that time, tricomonosis caused a major collapse in the Finnish green cover, after which the stock of the species has been recovering.
There have been sick greens now, but at least not on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, the Museum Master of Natural Science at the University of Helsinki.
It is feared that the previous epidemic of green bees will recur again unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: stop the bird’s summer food immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty wishes to benefit from a home-field advantage at the Renaissance Club
The former European first player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home-field representation for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian is holding the 25th Scotland Senior Open tournament.
Last year, Rafferty, a North Irishman, conducted a tournament in the Archerfield Links field next door before the last round, but eventually lost Paul Eales. Rafferty has been interested in a new place and acts as an ambassador to the tournament on behalf of the founder and CEO of the club Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the building of the Renaissance Club, and with this event, it's gonna get to its full glory," says Rafferty.
"Players see the field at its best. It's in great condition.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's an enthusiastic ambassador to the game, and he's proud of his accomplishments here.
"The tournament is a wonderful introduction to this field."
The Englishman, Eales, defends the championship for the first time, even though he has won the tour of Europe and the European challenger tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a really special occasion," says the player living in Southport.
"I couldn't defend my victory at Extremedura Open, because this year's tournament is not part of the tour.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to mind: winning the tournament was a great thing for me and my wife, Sharon.
It was a great time that we'll always remember."
Gary Orr will return to action on his own soil, and he'll go on tour after 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first performance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing in the home area is always more important than usual," Orr, who lives in Helensburgh says.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again, and I've played pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far."
The trio will be accompanied by the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Majors Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament will be attended by six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Car parking costs five pounds if the car has only a driver, and 10 pounds if the car has at least two people.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK Cancer.
In the bag, possible indoor air problems of the barracks were solved.
At least no indoor air problems have been found in the Säkylä in the message company of Pori’s Brigade, and the Brigade was reported on Thursday.
Inland air research will continue.
The studies began when a man who stopped his military service for health reasons thought that his health was impaired because of bad indoor air.
According to Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been identified in the health situation of other guards.
It turned out that this was an individual case, and other servants in that unit had no health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this in depth.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any problems with indoor air, says Holma.
According to the Brigade’s press release, due to the arrival in July, the goods had to be transferred to the barracks, which allowed the dust to increase temporarily.
That's why the air may have seemed too tight," says Holma.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia’s Goldland
Bardina Degei doesn't use her cooking stove.
He doesn't use a catalyst. He doesn't use a catalyst.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Pania region, located in the restless province of Papua, Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the sweet potatoes – locally "nota" – directly into his fire.
In half an hour, the sweet potato burned on the back of the cart will be eaten with a bare, unwashed hand.
Degei’s home has no furniture. He sits in a muddy underground, where he usually also takes care of his daily chores, such as washing laundry in the muddy water applied for from a nearby swamp.
The toilet office is provided by a bucket in the ceiling room.
Degei is the youngest of the four wives of his husband, and he has not been appointed to care for the fields.
Multi-maritality is common here.
Late work can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot. In addition, it must be taken into account by soldiers.
"No one dares walk in the village after 5:00 a.m.," says Degei.
This is a rare look at the everyday highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. It was preceded by a controversial referendum, in which 1 026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement against the Dutch regime quickly turned its hatred towards the Jakarta government, which has strict control of the region and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from accessing it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua. Eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is an isolated and agglomerated one-and-a-half hour flight from the capital of the province from Jayapura to Nabire, and continues on a five-hour road trip to the abdomen on the rental car.
There's no public traffic here.
There are wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences in the city of some 19 000 inhabitants, whose roofs have been painted to brown.
Only a few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the Christian missionaries came, the people of Papua Mee Pago worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
Other changes have taken place.
"We didn't have any such clothes," Degei says. He means his colorful, hand-woven twist head, dark skirt and bright-colored blouse.
Before, all we had was leaves covered in our bodies.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy are the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's goldland.
Pania is a highland area about the size of New Jersey with a population of 153 000. It is only about a hundred kilometers from Pania, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix, U.S.A.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in wood reserves.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, for they mean the repressive presence of a strong army in Indonesia.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military staff and military local units almost 20 million dollars between 1998 and 2004 and that individual officers were paid up to $150 000.
The bean’s demands for greater sovereignty threaten this source of income, and they are silenced without mercy.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 Papua and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands since 1969.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass deaths in the highlands of the Papuane tribes in the 1970s received the proportions of genocide.
Last year, more than 3,900 people were arrested by the Indonesian police in peaceful demonstrations.
We Will Lose Everything 2016 reports of previous year's cruelties, such as executions without trial, torture – rapes and electric shocks are particularly popular means – and ruthless attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because of the weekly number of cases," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher of the Human Rights Watch.
Screws have been tightened when the natural resources of Papua attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants in the province, 83 percent are Christians, but the demographic structure is changing as the people of Indonesia move Muslims from the islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes to the region in the hope of a better livelihood.
Javas Warung Food Houses sell fried chicken and gado-gado-green blend in peanut sauce.
It's hard for the locals to compete.
"The changers have started selling chicken and vegetables at a lower price than the locals," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old, who is from Pania and moved to the province capital after work.
"The local women lost their clients."
In his 2014 election campaign, Indonesian President Widodo – called Jokowi – promised to address the injustice and human rights violations in Papua.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta Presidential Castle.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts broke because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and waited for him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," says You.
In Pania, a wave base of some kind was experienced only two months after Jokow’s office in October.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs at the fire in Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared out of the dark on motorcycles.
Scared children told soldiers that they should use headlights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers captured the children and assaulted them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of assault.
A few hours later, the building of the State Electoral Commission near the venue was set on fire, and the next day it began to happen.
About a thousand — young men and women and children — gathered at the football field before the local police station and the military headquarters for justice.
They had the hunting bows for the festivities, and they began to perform the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, where they danced in the circle and imitated the song of birds.
Some of the protestors began to stone police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere fevered, soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on the official document that Time magazine has seen, which has not been published in the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, resident leader of the Kego Koto area, suspected that the situation would be out of control and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot to the left wrist," he told the Time magazine on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from soldiers' ranks.
"A lot of shots were fired in the throttle."
Alfius Youwi was shot three times and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him, and I made sure it was him," told Yohanes TIME, sad. In the way of many Indonesians, he used only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... "I kissed him."
Mr. Yotje Mende told the reporters that the police were only protecting the police station because it was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Pupjo Sulistayo, the informant of the Papua Police Department in 2015.
"Then it's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many were injured.
The next day, knowledge of the death took place in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to address the violence in Papua.
"I want the case investigated immediately so that nothing like this ever happens again."
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he will launch investigations of human rights violations outside the judicial system.
However, he began to withdraw his words immediately.
"The biggest part of the violations happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate violations, but it requires certain processes," he said.
In an interview in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he was not going to start his studies in Papua.
"It's all settled in court," he told me.
The UN blames Wiranto for "criminal humanity", which is related to the death of more than a thousand people in the bloodless independence vote in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto said to Time magazine that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been resolved, including the events in Pania.
The families of the victims of Pania take a grim view of the claims.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired of this."
He says he's still living in fear, even though it's been years.
"Yes, I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panics are afraid to discuss the event.
He tells us that the soldiers had abused him when he had helped bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after burying the victims," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in the Pania neighbourhood in Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the village and the construction company’s director, who started when the director refused to take the man who had lost consciousness to the hospital. Among the injured there were also children.
The man in need of hospital care was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been on water fishing in a nearby river. He died on the way to the hospital.
In front of the company’s office, the angry villagers expressed their views at the construction site.
According to the police, the villagers stoned policemen who responded with warning shots.
According to the locals, however, the mobile police force of the Indonesian paramilitary force opened fire to the crowd, when a villageman was killed.
"We're terrified. We're afraid of revenge," says Dominggu Badii, 29-year-old, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the shootings to be held accountable and for the withdrawal of the mobile police unit from the area.
Pania has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds dissatisfaction with the Mee, Mon, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the wheaty highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels who claim to defend the rights of the beans by random attacks and the kidnapping of the Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the OPM are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of "security of national sovereignty".
Some of those arrested will never come back.
Among the beans, Pania is known as a sad, forgotten place.
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There is little rice available for sale in Enarotal, and it is also too expensive for the locals,
Just like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, and one woman can be responsible for four or five sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold in the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in local and immigrant income have increased and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened to Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs and they usually go to better educated and more wealthy migrants than locals.
Only a few beans have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village because there's no work or money here," says John Gobai, President of the Pania Tribe Council.
The outcast Papua will be a little distracted in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news are still strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were banished from Papua even though they had been granted a rare description permit. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his electoral promises. He has not increased transparency and has not contributed to development by removing the restrictions on news.
"There are new risks for journalists reporting on the most troubled provinces of Indonesia in Papua and Western Papua: refusal of a visa and blacklisting", Kine said in her opinion.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is under pressure only by the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "number of and widespread violations" of Papua, including the Pania shooting attack.
These countries have also traditionally supported the release movement in Papua.
Arrmanatha Nasir, an informant of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, denied the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations".
Locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When the official Dutch delegation led by Ambassador Kees Van Bar visited Jayapura on 4.5.2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says the anonymous source who attended the meeting.
There are presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019, but the Papuans say that they will probably no longer vote for Jokowi.
"Which means good, but there are people around him who are involved in the Pania shooting attack," says Gobai, President of the Tribe Council.
He wants Mokow to know the situation of the Panics: they live under the authority of a greedy and unpredictable army in need and poverty, practically without health services and educational opportunities.
According to Gobai, the Panics, like the other parrots, consider the sounds they give to Jokow to be a "debt" that has to be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the victims of the Pania shooting again showed a symbolic resistance: they buried one of the victims in a country opposite the police station and the military headquarters.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," says Yacobus, in his head in a state of misery.
"What else can we do?"
Derek Chisora tells me that Robert Helenius' rematch is cancelled: "Even his own fans don't want to see".
The heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Derek Chisora were to fight on May 27 in the Hartwall arena.
However, the fight was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora will give a reason for floping the rematch on Helen's shoulders.
My fight in Finland failed, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight 'cause he sucks, Chisora's bored.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in a full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Heleny won the match with a controversial point-and-point sentence.
The ticket sale of the rematch went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match has been moved to autumn.
It's been a long time since we've heard anything new about the fight.
The withdrawal, however, will no longer harm Chisora.
The fight would probably have been cancelled after Chisora’s illness.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up in hard pain.
My daughter was about to explode.
The hospital said I needed surgery, Chisora says.
Britt says she's currently in a condition of about 45%.
From the point of view, he's not interested in a rematch with Helenius. He's targeting Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss for Whyte in December with a discoloration.
The fire took over again in Dubai, Dubai, by the Torch cloud designer.
The flames took over the world's highest residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of people fled from the 79-story building, which was 337 metres high.
This was already the second fire in two years in a building called Touch, a torch.
The building was cleared, and no one was known to be injured, and the reason for the fire was no idea immediately after the incident.
"We were asleep and woke up with a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes," the resident of George told Reuters.
According to Dubai’s rescue services, fire extinguished at 4 a.m. in the morning, local time and remained to cool the building.
The government announced that they would arrange the accommodation for those who had left their homes.
The case may again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surfaces of high buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Board of Directors of the Torr Building carried out a study which revealed that the most damage was caused by the plates used for covering and insulation of the facade.
In Britain, the police believe that London’s Grenfall Tower insulation and curtains could contribute to the rapid progress of flames in a fire where 80 people died in June.
A moped was stolen during the night from a car park in Joensuu.
A moped was stolen from a car park in Joensuu between Tuesday 21 and Wednesday 5 a.m.
Mopo disappeared from Niinaara at Tikkamäe 2.
The moped was Sky Team Monkey.

In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers take prohibited items on board, reveals a survey
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unwittingly exported prohibited items to aircraft by inspection points of the U.S. Road Safety Agency (TSA). At least 6 percent of passengers had knives or other articles with steel that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent reported that they had only later learned that they had been transporting weapons, ammunition, or explosives in error.
More than a thousand passengers replied to the questionnaire and was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to violate the rules than others.
19.7 per cent of passengers who deliberately violated the TSA rules were representatives of the Y-generation and less than 15 per cent were members of the X-generation.
In most cases, the rules were broken by taking food and liquids onto the plane.
In addition, 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men reported that they had deliberately exported prohibited drugs to the aircraft.
The survey involved passengers from different parts of the United States. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many people had accidentally taken smuggling goods and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that the most travellers are also most likely to pass a security check – knowingly or not knowingly.
However, as the company that did the survey points out, TSA's instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids can be taken onto the plane and how much.
It is not surprising, then, that most of the TSA's seizures are liquids.
For some time, there was also the belief that books should not be taken to the plane.
Liquids may be taken to domestic flights, but not international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, rounded up his decision to delay the decisions taken during Obama's period to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states sued the EPA Director of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, for his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smoke-reducing emissions made during the Obama regime.
According to Pruit, the change shows that the agency under his command takes better account of the needs of the decision-makers responsible for the state's environmental affairs.
Mrs Pruitt did not mention, by word, the action brought against her earlier decision before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The Landesbankinn should start to comply with the 2015 Landesbankinn requirement as from 1.10.
In June, Mrs Pruitt announced that she would move the implementation of the decisions forward for a year, so that her agency has more time to get to know the plan because the Agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hamper economic growth".
Pruitt was the general prosecutor of the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him head of the EPA. Pruitt is known as the opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical industry and the fossil fuels industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback on Pruitt's plan to ease the rules.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington adopted a decision requiring the companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks, in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama ruling on oil and gas companies.
In its opinion on Wednesday evening, Mr Pruitt claimed that his full translation of the ozone provisions would only strengthen EPA cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements in line with the timetable.
"In previous administration, EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines and then waited for the activist groups and others to sue it to reach agreement on timetables," Pruitt said. In his previous act, he challenged the environmental agency's court more than ten times.
"We do not believe in regulation through trial and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers that it gives us."
However, the EPA opinion concluded that Pruitt could continue to use its powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers to ensure that the provisions were "justifiable and based on the best available information".
The Republicans are driving a wider change of ozone regulations in Congress.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay implementation of the 2015 decisions for at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
The public prosecutor of the state of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who led the EPA association this week, told us that the group is going to continue the pressure.
"The change in the mind of the EPA as a result of our actions is a major victory for the 6.7 million people in New York and over 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of the smoke in their communities," said Schneiderman.
In addition to New York, the case was brought by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Earth’s ozone is generated when emissions from, for example, cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
This can cause serious breathing difficulties for sensitive groups of people, including thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists welcomed Pruit’s surprising change of direction.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required to make a healthy sense of our breathing," says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre of Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump regime, as its ideological objective is to act under the conditions of polluters and other groups of interests."
The supercar manufacturer's on his way to the street SUV, "it's taking place in Ferrari style."
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while maintaining its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will take place in Ferrari style, said President Sergio Marchionne at the press conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year, when the Italian supercar manufacturer will present its new five-year plan, Automative News will news.
All Cinderella cases in Eastern Savo of the same virus type
Coastal salmon fever infection is the same type of virus as the previous cases of Eastern Savo, reports THL.
The virology laboratory of the Health and Welfare Institute has ensured on Thursday that the fifth plague of Eastern Savo is the same strain as that of previous infections.
THL has ensured that on Friday 28 July, a coastal salami person has the same type of infection as the previous cases of Eastern Savo.
On the basis of this information, all the infections detected in Eastern Savo are related to the first ashtray detected in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means we haven't come up with any other types of Cinderella virus.
It is possible, however, that new infections may emerge from the fifth patient until mid-August, and the epidemic is therefore still not over, says Mirkalena Erkkilä, a doctor responsible for primary health disease in Soster.
There have been no new cinderella outbreaks or suspicions since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important for everyone to take care of the timeliness of their vaccination cover, Erkkilä reminds us.
More on the subject: In Pirkanmaa there were three new outbreaks of Cinderella - "Infections or epidemics are very unlikely"
Finland prepares to make a permitted scream
The dot soup was not even considered legal.
Background to the fact that the process produces methanol, along with alcohol, which is toxic.
Making a scream at home is legal next year, but the legalization of the spotting soup is not even considered.
The scream is prepared by rolling, and the spot is distilled.
The reason behind the distillation regulation is that the process produces methanol, along with alcohol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to make a pomegranate soup for every man's rights, Mr Ismo Tuominen of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the alcohol law, no legalisation of the spotting was considered.
It was also not brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, states Ambassador Outi Mäkelä.
He is a member of the negotiating group of the parliamentary groups of the Government Party, who took a position on the reform of the alcohol law.
You can still not even grant a permit for distillation at home on the application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
Imports tell us that there will be a simple rule for the home manufacture of alcoholic beverages: alcohol can be produced at home by fermentation.
This means that in addition to beer, cider, and wine, you can legally scream at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law removes the requirements of flavourings and flavourings and allows the splinter to be produced, Mäkelä states.
The production still needs to be made in such a way that the raw materials or the flavourings resulting from their fermentation are clearly detectable.
Under the new law, you can make as many drinks as you want, and self - sacrificing alcohol can be given as a gift.
You still can't put it on the market.
The killing is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The draft law on alcohol is now under examination by the Ministry of Justice.
The alcohol law will come to Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session was held on 5 September.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the parliament had already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was sent to the hospital by armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pain, was admitted to a hospital in South Africa because of suspicion of a heart attack.
Pistorius has already gotten out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is in prison in Atteridgeville.
According to British Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital this morning with armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The informant at the prison confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for research.
On the other hand, the informant of the family of Pistorius told us that the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Littered phone conversations reveal Trump's pressure on Mexico to build a border wall.
The liters of telephone conversations between President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have leaked to Washington Post.
On 27 January 2017, Trump called on the Mexican President, Enrique Peña Nieto, to stop his public talk about his intention not to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States rang at Nieto because he had knocked out the wall project in public. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential election campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a Literation on Trump's first call to the Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement whereby the United States would take refugees on its way to Australia is "magic", "dangerous" and "dump". According to Trump, the agreement negotiated during Obama's period would make him look like an idiot because he had proposed a ban on the residence of refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the call by saying to Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call of all day."
Georgian massacre: Activists re-enacted racist lynching in the hope of justice
The Ford Mercury car passes a crowd in the small town of Monroe in the rural area of Georgia and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers in the car and a white driver, four armed men blocking the road before the car gets to the bridge.
The leader of the group, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit, takes a deep breath of his cigar and he's going through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n-- u!" the man coughs.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
This shocking event is, fortunately, just a reflight, which was presented on 22 July 2017.
However, the shocks of shock are genuine when the hanger loop is applied to the neck of "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to reenact the events of 1946. At the time Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's been charged with murder.
"It is confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – even though the murderers live among us and many people need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who will help with the rearrangement.
"It's a disgrace to history, but above all, it's a burden that weighs on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian Congressman.
To him, the remodeling must be a startling invitation to action, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want the guilty people to be brought to justice. We want things to be concluded at last, and we want to recover from sorrow and make a settlement, but above all, we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make peace until we get justice."
The coroner will cover the body of the victim who died in Georgia's massacre on 27.7.46.
According to FBI records from NBC News, over 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts were suspected of lynching.
But no one was accused of murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say that the motives for lynching have always been known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the black people of the state of Georgia were given the highest right to vote for the first time in the presidential election, the Supreme Court of Justice took its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, during the election, there was an incident involving a black tenant Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight apparently involving Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, it was rumored that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with this child.
According to the FBI, a powerful white landowner, Loy Harrison, paid a $600 guarantee from Malcom on 25.7.46 against which he was released from prison.
On their way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their cars before the Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out Harrison ordered and organized the murders," the FBI report states.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities. The authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks is a more immediate expression of this.
"It was a right-wing murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to be informed that they would do the same if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the redeployment of Georgia's massacre for almost a decade.
The presentation is extremely realistic and instigating, a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States of America today.
It's hard to watch a show, but it's even harder not to see what Greene says is meant.
"We don't want to talk about lynching 'cause we're gonna have to face our own dark side," the director says.
"But I can't establish a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
On the first day of this year’s show, about 30 actors — about a dozen blacks and a dozen whites — gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the show.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has been playing the local Ku Klux Klan leader for years, but the role is always just as difficult and unpleasant.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"It is important, however, that this aspect of history should also be displayed so that it will never happen again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona train, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show starts with a scene where Malcom yells at Hester, and he's angry that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
"You didn't hear me?
Rascona or Hester is responding.
And then we're gonna hit it.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs at me the most.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene says.
"I just don't think the whites used the word n--u."
"Yes," another black actor confirms.
"It's a slang, you need to use a longer version."
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is dominated by a friend's spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, but because they want to respect the memory of the people who died.
The scene begins at the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are in check.
No one's laughing.
The revival will end quickly and violently.
Cries, shots — and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral home stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday Strange Fruit.
His voice is broken at every other word.
A few ten metres away, fifty viewers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost half of the audience are black and half are white.
There's a couple here to watch a show from Ithaca, New York, but most of it's local.
They've been taking Brooks' instructions to the victims' graves in Georgia's pressure of moisture.
The murders have turned from story to story, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song, Greene invites a crowd to check the bodies.
Children struggle to look at fake blood and mobile bodies and whisper at each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutters like he reminds himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
Actors who played lynchers take off their cape and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the local Ku Klux Klan man.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then breaks into tears after a hard show.
"Don't worry," the woman in the show is comforting.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and the actors will meet for a joint dinner.
The white couple from Altanta are actively discussing the performance with the black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski is difficult to find words when she describes the feelings raised by the performance.
"It's hard to listen to horrible words and look at horrible things that people say and do that look the same as you – just because they look the same as you," he says.
"My presentation made me realize that lynchings are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for those who sit at the same table.
He says he's already started planning next year's show.
"Recovery is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also a educational experience," Brooks says.
"The message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it."
Growing plants in shops really saves: by removing this much "excess parts"
Is it allowed to remove the leaves of the flower cabbage in the store before weighing?
What about taking off the big hat part of the pineapple? It weighs how much?
The answers share strongly: for one it is a sign of extreme delinquency, while others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that are not used and yet go to the trash at home.
The phenomenon is recognized in stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket Department of Helsinki’s Ruoholahti (K-Citymarket) because many rip off the leaves of the flower cabbage, for example.
In the box, the leaves are traded for bio-waste.
According to the news published by the economic message, snooping with vegetable stumps amazes traders.
But how much money is actually saved by removing the extra parts of the vegetables before weighing?
How important is this a way of snooping?
We women tested how the price changes when you take away leaves or herds from pineapple, flat artichokes, delicious mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower.
Flower cabbage: €2.10 was €1.80 when all leaves were peeled out.
Pineapple: the price of the whole pineapple costing EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its stock turned off.
Latva artichokes: EUR 2.60 became EUR 2.40 when the short stock was cut off.
Cute mushrooms: Two delicious mushrooms cost 75 cents in total.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: The average size of broccoli cost 1 euro and no stock for 80 cents.
Final result: If leaves and strains are taken off, save at best a few dozen cents for one vegetable.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20 per cent.
Thus, a total of EUR 1.20 would have been saved for these purchases!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona. The brassi star signed a five-year contract with PSG.
The Brazilian journalist Neymar has concluded a five - year agreement with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
On Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid a purchase price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, playing in the Spanish league.
The maximum transfer amount of € 222 million is the highest in football history.
In the past, Manchester United had a record, which paid EUR 105 million last summer for the French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league previously blocked the transfer on Thursday when it rejected Neymar's first payment company.
Under the rules of the League, the buying-out company cannot pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player must buy-out his or her contract, which is done by recycling money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and its representatives who provided the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will be presented to a new audience at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa will look into the details
In its communication, Barcelona also reported on the payment of the European Football Union to Uefa in order to enable it to determine any disciplinary action that might arise from the case.
Among other things, the President of the Spanish League, Javier Tebas, has suspected that the PSG is in breach of Uefa's financial fair play.
Uefa can punish the company, which will lose more than EUR 30 million over a period of three years.
According to Uefa, Neymar's transfer does not automatically break its economic section.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG affects the company's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players with substantial sums of money, Uefa was informed.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatari company Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former tennis pro, the Qatari Nasser al-Khelaif.
Ten shirts for Neymar
Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from a lightning strike... the flash was recorded in an airport security camera.
Austin Dunn was doing normal operations on a plane at the International Airport of South-Florida with a couple of colleagues, when suddenly lightning struck the plane from the rainy sky.
The lightning force threw the plane's wing into the land of Dunn near it.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and told me that the brother was electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I'm just asking if he's alive, Austin's sister, Austin, says.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and a brain bleed.
It was a tough experience for the whole family.
You can't wait for that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Auutumn says.
According to the airport’s representative, the lightning risk warning system was activated at the time of the incident and the transport operation itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and stimulates business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British training group Pearson announced that it would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when starting a new restructuring programme in response to the pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job reductions are mainly made at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019. The company already reduced 4 000 jobs in previous restructurings.
Pearson stated that it would again cut costs by GBP 300 million in May as part of its third savings programme, which is intended to reinvigorate the business that has deteriorated as a result of the rapid digitalisation.
Last month Pearson decided to sell its share of the Penguin Random House to his partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for the current year. Its net sales increased by one per cent in the first half of the year and amounted to GBP 2.05 billion.
Assault in Kabul: NATO's soldier died in a suicide attack
The suicide bomber attacked the military embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan. According to the authorities, NATO's soldier was killed and several others were wounded.
According to NATO, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians also died in the attack on the Qarabagh region of Kabul.
The explosion is the last violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people died in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint patrol between NATO and the Afghan army was attacked by a "man-made explosive device".
The opinion stated that all injured persons were stable and were treated at the US Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are important concerns for NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in the first half of 2017, of which 20 % were killed in the capital city.
At the end of July, the car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul in an area where mainly Shiia Muslims live.
The Taliban said he was behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people died in a bomb attack in central Kabul, the country's most devastating militia attack since the U.S.-led troops overthrow the Taliban in 2001.
Violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States is sending more troops to assist the local army and the police.
According to the correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policy and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA turns its decision to postpone the implementation of smoke fog regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay the implementation of decisions under the Obama regime to reduce smoke-reducing emissions on the day after 15 states had brought the Agency to justice.
EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called 'ozone definitions' of 2015 late on Wednesday, which according to the Agency is evidence of its commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states," said Director Scott Pruitt in the Agency's opinion.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of the ozone definition for one year to October 2018. According to the definitions, the smoke pollution is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where the reduction of pollution is to be carried out in accordance with higher air quality standards.
On Tuesday, 15 states governed mainly by democracy, including the District of Columbia, were sued by the Agency.
The administration of President Donald Trump has been looking for ways to mitigate the environmental regulations of Barack Obama, which, according to Mr Trump, form part of a broader programme for economic growth.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of the increase in emissions.
According to the EPA website, inhaling ozone-containing air "may impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, Isis had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
The suspect was that the bomb was intended to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company interrupted before the security check.
The police won't tell me exactly why the company stopped.
The second plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device that separates toxic non-coloured gas and to bring the device to a full public place, such as public transport.
Australian Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Because of suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations continue.
Managing Director of Liquids: Renewable fuels did well
Oil refiner Liquid's profit before taxes fell, but hit the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievosen, the company made good results in oil products, sales volumes of renewable products rose to record levels and the development of the operating profit of the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year’s comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievoinen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and a more favourable market, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will complete the strategic investments we announced earlier in 2017, said Lievonen in the release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Holidayshenko will discuss a possible match at their first meeting.
Vasyl Lomatchenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of a series of less than 66.7 kg, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms in the ESPN sports channel in Los Angeles until WBC’s undefeated light series champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet the Lomatchenko, the WBO’s superior feather series.
Garcia won the showtime on Saturday with the unanimous decision of the former four-class world champion Adrian Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomatchenko have been among the top five on a list that compares the boxers of different categories of printing.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How's it going, master?
Good luck with the fight!"
Lomathenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on the ESPN channel at seven Saturdays.
When the twin posed to photographers, the manager of the Lomathenko Egis Klimas pointed out that the match between men would be "permanent in terms of size".
"I'm a former feather-seriesman," Garcia reminded me.
"I moved up the series for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a small size, 63.5 kilos.
I want to go back to the light series.
He's got to get into the light series [61,2 kilos], and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's meet their wishes."
Lomathenko agreed.
"The boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the match should be held on the pay channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomathenko to debut in the light series later this year and will fight against Garcia next summer (37-0,30 knockouts). Garcia would also be interested in facing the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will fight in the light series in Forum on 23 September.
"The fight could be on the pay channel because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later stated that she was ready to fight with the channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else attracts as much attention.
It's okay for me as soon as we reach an agreement..."
Garcia said she appreciated Lomathenko as a "unbelieving fighter" and maybe she was going to go see the Saturday match.
Lomathenko interrupted Garcia's compliments and said that this three-grade champion from Riverside looked like a real slow one, Mike... but you needed that knockout.
Garcia said he focused first on showing the force of impact and then boxing.
The men said they felt that the fight between them would be desired to be ever stronger.
"This is the fight we're waiting for.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomathenko said he expected to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Average wage 5 300 euros, training what happens - the investment advice situation was "float and free"
The quality of investment advice has been a great deal lately.
Last time, Helsingin Sanomat told of Ritva, 68, to whom the banker’s investment counsellors spoke when selling investment products.
The rules on investment advisors and various sales of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
These increases will be based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will be applicable from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisors and workers selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not specify the skills requirements.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service complete their own APV1 or APV2 qualification.
The financial sector has authorized the organisation of qualifications for a company called APV Investment Studies Ltd, which has a group of experts from the Financial Control (Fiva), universities and industry.
The qualifications are 12-15 credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides management development services.
Its website tells us that in general both exams are "extensive in terms of requirements".
The educational material of the qualifications includes 10-15 books, as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, Managing Director of APV Investment Studies Oy, reports that the percentage of passable exams is roughly 70.
Of the employees of the largest banks, almost all of the investment services provided have completed either APV1 or APV2 because they are compulsory according to the company's own rules.
Then there are smaller banking movements without mentioning the names of the staff whose qualifications seem to have been avoided, says Savikko.
According to him, there are "some" such bank movements.
According to Saviko, the APV1 qualification has been completed by 13 000-14 000 people since 2000 and by some 3 000 people who are more demanding for investment advisors.
Some banking companies consider that a qualification to be an advantage.
There are much stricter skills requirements in several other sectors.
Savikko says that the financial recommendation requires the completion of APV qualifications, as it is then that the expertise in the investment sector is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, on average, financial and investment advisors make several thousand euros per month in commissions, including benefits in kind and earnings.
The average daily working hours for monthly employed persons are approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men working on the job earn over EUR 5 900 per month and women over EUR 4 500, respectively.
On average, the ten who make the most money earns around EUR 8 100.
A tenth of men who make the most money earn more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, one tenth of women who make the most make more than EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
To date, self-regulation has been entrusted to the employee and to the task force.
According to Fiva, the audit carried out by Fiva was carried out in individual cases where the investment advisor’s professional skills and qualifications were insufficient on the basis of the consultant’s activities.
Investment products can also, in principle, be sold even if the skills and qualifications are at a low level.
From this point of view, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other sectors have much stricter skills requirements, says Savikko.
According to Saviko, this will be tightened up from the beginning of next year by the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II).
It requires that each firm is responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services is sufficiently competent.
Financial supervision, on the other hand, has the power to determine what needs to be done.
Fiva’s market supervisor Marko Hovi explains that one of the clear changes to the current situation is the legislation on the skills and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply both to the staff of investment firms and to tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
The court reports that according to the Government’s proposal by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva is authorised to determine the knowledge and experience.
What they exactly are will be decided by these views in the autumn to come.
In the future, the company will also have to provide for the necessary training and, if necessary, monitoring and further training.
All of this must be documented, and the company is required to prove that this has also been done.
The court states that, in practice, the company must, for example, identify the personnel’s duties at individual level.
There will certainly be different levels of requirement depending on whether it is investment advice or product sales.
According to the court, there is also a new requirement to work with someone more experienced if knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
In other words, if the company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who fulfils the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the court, as a result of this change, the rules will be tightened up and put into practice.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
Photo: 787 Dreamliner passenger machine "created" on a giant plane to the United States
The plane's route was constructed over the United States in the service of Flightradar24.
The flight was carried out on Thursday with 787 Dreamliner aircraft, which was used by Boeing to test the durability of the Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane from Seattle flew 18 hours and 1 minute for 15 700 km, which is longer than any regular commercial route flight in the world.
The flight stayed within the U.S. borders for the entire journey.
It flew through 17 states in total.
Imatra's sturdy beach swimming schools are not stopped by rain or sun's toast - Iines Koikenen's polski persistently with the help of the swimming village
All went on at good speed, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools run in Liette and Lempuka this and next week.
Although sometimes it rains and then it shines again, young swimmers are not in a hurry, says Taina Itkonen, the swimmers of swimming schools.
In this week's swimming schools, a total of 13 children, ten next week.
The number of children in the coming week was influenced by the fact that the school and the escara will begin, as it is estimated by Itkonen.
Imatra Beach Swimming School is organised in cooperation with the Gym project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, the beach of Liette had a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and the young swimmers were training to stay on the surface with the swimsuits, someone without it.
The smaller brothers and sisters also enjoyed the water.
It was all about Everything, five thought it would go deeper first.
Taina Itkonen, however, encouraged her to prowl at the beach.
You're doing great!
He told me he'd been swimming a lot this summer.
He's a good swimmer.
In the same way as everything, Vili Huhttane, 5.
You too can be satisfied with today’s achievements, the swimmer praised.
Jami Kallio, 4 again, sometimes wanted to go to the water wars.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, 6 swimming from the beach, considers the beach swimming school a good start for swimming.
Even though the weather has been what happens, Anna has always liked to go here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The swimmers packed up on the pier.
The boys had enough to do with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukunen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, plucked fruit, and cooked the day.
The training was already ongoing in the water, but there was no rush at the dock.
That's when you don't belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet bristles here's a connected story.
You see all kinds of things.
The Sinituote, which manufactures cleaning products, launched a series of unknown military products a few days ago.
I mean, dishwashers and laundry, and a toilet brush with a edge brush.
An unknown soldier is referring to the film he gets first-night in this autumn and to the marketing of the movie.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products have been ridiculed in social media: When will the unknown health ties come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Mättä, Vice President of the Blue Product say?
We're a co-operator of the film.
We're here to support this movie, like a lot of other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, says Mättä.
According to him, special presentations for the products will be available and the film will thus become visible.
Isn't there something funny about this - often when you think that products and the stories attached to them have something in common?
Yes, this is such a connecting story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, says Mättä.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not a stranger to military culture either, says Mätta.
Other business partners in the film Unknown Military include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, for example, Hartwall’s vichys, known as Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela, have been placed on the market.
Unknown products have already been recorded by Finnish blogist Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are also available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the film, so there is still a chance to continue.
The unknown partners have not yet revealed their war products, such as Valio, breeder, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
New results of Swedish asylum seekers' age tests were published
The latest results of the medical tests of asylum seekers in Sweden have been published. The results of the tests carried out by the new evaluation method reveal that over 80% of the tests were determined to be over 18 years old, but not everyone considers the tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Medical Office started testing earlier this year.
The tests can assess the age of the asylum seeker more precisely, and a new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the real age of the applicants who claimed to be underage.
6 880 tests have been carried out by the Finnish Immigration Service so far, and the results of 2 481 tests have now been published by the Finnish Medical Office. The tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
In addition, in 25 cases, the Office of Legal Medicine determined that the test was "possibly 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possiblely under 18 years of age".
The tests were only carried out in cases where there were reasonable grounds to suspect the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson, the Legal Medicine Office, reports that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are quite uniform. There are no significant differences in previous months' statistics," he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were identified as over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that applicants have lied to their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and announced that in 442 cases there were "reports that the subject is 18 years of age or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases, the applicant had openly stated that he was 18 years old this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes x-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of knee joints, and then dental doctors and radiologists analyze the images, and the method has also been criticised.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karoliinen Institute, whose work involves assessing the human biological maturity.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I think that the method used is not the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't determine the age, we shouldn't pretend we can," he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, the Board of Justice, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child becoming an adult is small.
The risk is greatest in a situation where the test is about 18 years old and the risk is about 10%."
Ilone collapsed 30 locations in Scotland
Five over pars in the third round spent section 30 of Mikko Ilosen on a score slide downwards in the European tour of golf in Scotland.
Ilonen left for Saturday at the divided place 11 but was found at the end of the round to divide position 41.
One double bog was built up in a difficult reel with three bogs.
It was hard for the rest of us, too.
Ian Poulter, an Englishman, stood up to share the top spot with one under par, even though he said that there was enough work to do with umbrellas.
Keli was raw, but I hung with him and finally the day was good, Poulter tuumi.
He shares a leading position with his compatriot Callum Shinkwin and Andrew Dodt, Australian.
Governor of West Virginia to change parties
Western Virginia's democratic governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday night at the Trump campaign event that he would change the party.
"The Democrats simply rejected me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you, after many prayers and thorough reflections... "Today I will tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
The audience broke out with a lot of applause.
"Tomorrow as a member of the registered Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that a significant announcement would be made at the campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support Hillary Clinton as a Democrat candidate.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited from his father a mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
His assets are worth about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the National Committee of the Republicans (RNC) issued an opinion that "Governor Justice's change of party is yet another blow to the democratic party, which would rather build obstacles than better America."
"The Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, justice's announcement is the last setback for a party without any leadership and unable to find a positive message combining people," said Ronna McDaniel, the representative of RNC, in his opinion on CBS news.
The lightnings sown damage - from Thursday becoming even the very thunderday of the summer
In the end of the week, there will also be more thunders in Southern Finland.
Over the past week, the country's central and northern regions and the region of South-West Finland have been bulging.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning struck several fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may be the day of the summer until now.
Last but not least, the thunder resorts have also found Finland.
During the past week, lightning has been in the middle and north of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
At the table, the lightning struck the power center of the row house, causing a small fire.
The rescue unit received a report of the fire about 15 minutes past midnight on Wednesday.
The power center was located in the sauna room at the end of the row house.
The rescue unit took out the roof and the wall to find the fire stations and turned off the fire in a quick way.
In total, 11 homes were left without electricity, but personal injury was avoided.
On the other hand, the lightning lit the outside building on flares in Harjuland before midnight.
At the time of the rescue, the building was already fully operational at the time of the fire, and the rescue facility could not but prevent the spread of the fire.
An outside building about 50 square feet [50 sq m] was burned to the ground.
In the direction of the Kuopio in Rääkküla, the lightning struck its own home.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flash of lightning.
The rescue unit came to check the case, but this time, the lightning couldn't get a fire out, only a few fuses exploded.
In traffic, the thunder caused problems on the train track between the Seinäjoki River and Vaasa, when the lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
Information on the defect was obtained between 8 and 9 Thursday morning, followed by the replacement of trains by buses.
The problem could only be corrected a little before five afternoons.
Since then, train traffic has also been able to continue normally on the run-in track.
The lightnings have sown destruction throughout Finland.
However, climate has been relatively low this summer.
These thunders of this summer have been absolutely unspeakable! assesses weather meteorologist Jari Tuovinen from the Department of Meteorology.
The thunderstorms of Wednesday and Thursday have been mainly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the small amount of lightning in the summer, many feel even powerful.
This might seem like a really tough thunderstorm, but that's what it's been like compared to this summer's thunder, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, the landslides were rapping 1,700 times, and on Thursday there was potential even for the toughest day of the summer: by about 4:00, there were 1,790 landslides in the poster.
If the weather continues at the beginning of the night, it is possible to reach more than two thousand lightnings, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record weakness was experienced in 2015, when the number of lightning in the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, this year’s number of lightnings had risen to 18 386 lightning.
So there is still something to be said for this year not to break the record of two years ago.
But you can expect the thunderskir to continue.
According to Tuovinen, air mass over Finland will also stay warm and moist during the end of the week, which is a suitable birth environment for the thunders.
The focus of the lightnings is on Saturday from the northern parts of the country to the south, where about 2,000 lightning days can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
The central part of the country will have a more uniform rainfall.
In such a way, Tuovinen says that only a few thunders.
Coe praises Russia's "open-minded" apology for the doping scandal
The world’s general sports boss Sebastian Coe praised the apology that Russia made on Thursday because of the doping scandal, but Coe added that it was not yet time to end Russia’s ban on participation.
Russian sports director Dmitri Shlyahtin said at the IAF Congress on Thursday at the World Cup that the ban on Russia is appropriate and that he is determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who took the gold medal or the silver medal in the competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the continuation of the ban. Russia was excluded from the sports competitions in November 2015, after the WADA report by the World Anti-Doping Agency presented evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I think his answer was very direct today. It was a very transparent presentation," Coe, president of the IAAF, told the journalists.
"All Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian sports association admitted that the country had been going through difficult times and said that it would do everything in its power to reorganise its activities."
Coe also said that he was 'satisfied' to the fact that Russia accepted the terms of the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the working group's recommendation that now is not the time to end Russia's ban," said Coe.
"We must do everything we can to normalise the situation in the coming months.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with the status of a neutral athlete in the World Championships of sports in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAF.
Rune Andersen, Director of the IAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
"Test is still insufficient, and the banned trainers continue to operate freely," he told the editors on Friday after his presentation to the IAF Council in London.
The production company was disappointed in the weak success of Tom of Finland
Tom of Finland did not succeed as the authors hoped, says Yle.
To be honest, I am disappointed to acknowledge that the CEO of Helsinki Film produced by the film, Annika Sucksdorff Yle, is interviewing.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film was premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached a fair 100 000 viewers, compared to the film budget, about EUR 5 million, little.
This won't be a lotto win, but now it's important for investors to get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful in their home country, they would have already had their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams of foreign distribution," Socksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The provisions restricting the use of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from transferring Spain from Barcelona to Paris-Germain, France.
Its possible sanctions for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which will be able to prevent the teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced the financial rules for fair play, which states that PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona for the conclusion of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar’s annual salary in the new company is in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France has a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar's transfer amount and connecting him to its star charts, as it follows that it is financed by the Qatar oil-rich family of rulers.
The clubs are allowed to use large amounts of money to buy players, but they need to be balanced with real income to ensure that football-related business is not loss-making.
The financial rules for fair play were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platinum, a French leader of UEFA, elected in 2007.
As a former football player, Platinum felt that the pursuit of success in debt was cheating and led to serious problems when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of the economic rules of fair play shifted from the debts of clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used in Chelsea for the first time in 2003 was significantly more difficult to implement. Abramovich bought a promising team, used huge sums of money to buy a player and created a global brand.
The current three-year period of assessment of the economic rules of fair play will last until 2018, during which time the clubs will be allowed to make a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
Although Platini had to leave UEFA president's role scandalously in 2015, his successor, Alexander Cefer, also wants to control the reckless use of the clubs.
"The rules of fair play are still in place and we will apply them in the future", Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the financial rules of fair game in UEFA, told Associated Press last week.
Even though PSG paid Neymar out of its contract with a lump sum, it may vary the amount in the accounts for the entire duration of its new contract.
Neymar has concluded a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual expenditure of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years.
Based on the financial rules of the fair game, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014. The largest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Abu Dhab-funded Manchester City.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million. In addition, the club was ordered to limit its Masters League to 21 players for the period 2014-2015 instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their revenues through companies related to its owners.
For example, if the Quatar company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal market level, UEFA does not calculate the aid as the actual result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatarese tourism authority to PSG was oversized.
It has also been shown that part of Neymar's earnings in PSG could be financed by contributions available from Qatar's World Cup Organisation for 2022.
However, the PSG and the Organisational Commission have banned Neymar from being held at the World Cup Ambassador, and it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such a arrangement.
In view of the previous sanctions imposed by PSG, UEFA will monitor more closely than usual attempts to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, the well-informed sources reported that UEFA has not negotiated with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
Sources gave an interview to Associated Press News Office, provided that their identity is not disclosed because they do not have the power to discuss the PSG situation.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG’s net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was over EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the past year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar to be able to attract new sponsors and increase the sales of club products and toy shirts.
The company estimates that its net sales will increase by at least 30 % as a result of the Neymar Agreement.
The Spanish league, which was clearly upset by the departure of the best player in the world, tried to make it difficult for Neymar to move, which was claimed to be in breach of the economic rules of a fair game.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the Society and the State," said Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the Quatar ownership of PSG.
Arsenal’s manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state’s financing of football club’s activities. Arsenal is owned by an American sports company.
"The incident is the result of ownership, which has completely changed the football environment in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"All is possible after the state owns the football team.
There are so many kinds of interests involved in the fact that the famous player represents the state."
It is now urgent: coach of Finnish MM athletes stuck in Helsinki
The long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and the trio Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan are stuck in Helsinki, even though he should be coaching the sports at the World Cup in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow for the long jump and Mäkelä will compete for the trio on Saturday.
However, the two coach, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa in Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this in the British Embassy without any results.
The coach has an invitation from the World Cup Organizers as a documentary, but it has not been able to obtain a visa either.
I wonder if this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or not, Coach Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always managed visa issues successfully in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Association SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone at the stadium looks at the step marks right, Arttu Pajulahti said that his coach could be excluded.
MM medal for FinlandLontoo requires a miracle
The World Cup of Sports will start in London today on Friday and last a fair week on Sunday 13 August.
Sports, cross-country skiing and hockey are the species that Finnish bench athletes are passionate about from year to year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course there are other meters.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from value fairs to value fairs, where experience is acquired to mature the athlete's performance to the level that the M.M.M. Medal is truly possible for adults.
Now Finland's small MM team does not have such young athletes, nor do there are any conspirators.
The MM medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sport is that miracles can happen.
It draws bench athletes to the TV screen and glues to follow the races, even though London medals are being solved due to the time difference only in the evening.
Of the previous World Cup in sport, Finland received one bronze medal in 2015.
It was brought by the spear thrower, Tero Tallimäki.
The Trustees expect a medal from the Long Mountain even now, even though the second one tells about the results of recent times of his and other players, and the remaining of the Long Mountain will be cut in last summer's value fairs.
In these games no matter what happens, Põhjamäki will remain in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes, access to the final event or making their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and believe in Finland's realistic medal hunt for sport in the coming years will be a good success in the international value fairs of young people, too, this summer.
The processing of young talent and the financial support for its work are more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come in a moment, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns can also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope that the London Games will remain in history as the games of Usai Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of, for example, the fear of terrorism or poor attacks.
Ate Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air, "But I'm sorry."
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi is second in the big air race in Colorado, U.S.A.
Copper Mountain's number two is Rukajärvi's best big oi in the world cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson, U.S.A.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
He tried to jump the capballerial 1080 for the first time in the race, and it was very close to succeeding.
It feels good, and it's a good file right now, but I'm sorry the last jump didn't go quite right.
Yes, I'm going to try it again in the race from now on, Tuumi Rukajärvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a jumper made for the species.
Viking Line's new high-speed ship stuck in a port in Helsinki
The new high-speed ship of the shipping company Viking, FSTR, is very late on schedule.
The fast ship was supposed to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6 p.m.
The ship was loaded in eight countries.
The ship came to Helsinki late.
At least an hour and a half I've been waiting for you to board the ship.
Now the sequence is moving a little bit, at the port of Helsinki, the Estonian, Johannes Rebane, who is waiting for access to the ship, reported at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought there was a technical error on the new ship.
Rebane said that the shipping company had brought water bottles to those waiting in their cars.
The Viking Communication Manager Christa Grönlund tells IS that there was a technical error.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be late for a few hours on Tallinn's return trip.
The ship was to leave Tallinn at 8:15 p.m.
42-metre special transport disrupts transport on the Sixth Avenue on Thursday night
The 42-metre-long special transportation moves from Muuko to Mustola port during the Thursday night.
The transport from 9 am should be available by 11 p.m.
The police control traffic on the Sixth Avenue, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
Transport from the mountain is on the road 13 to the port of Mustola.
Small District Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, the story evokes both the days of the characters of the 80s and the grunge of the 90s (at that time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great series of The State exams for MTV) and their own time – before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars in the series moved to bigger things in their career.
As a cultural product, it is both a parodia and a description of the constant recollection that we are stuck to during the Facebook age.
As a commercial product, it seems to have lived by now.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humor (said, among other things, as the background story of the vegetable can that speaks with the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
The essence of the game is that middle-aged actors act as covetous teenagers of the age-of-age approach. Emphasizing it makes the impossible to reach the past part of a joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its barodine is more fragmented: for example, it paraodiates the 1990s stalker movies, such as the horror movie The Hand that rocks the box.
At one point, one of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skaters and "other stuff from 1991."
Many of the stories are the same as before.
The good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still not over Katie (Margureite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And there's a crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (so-called Michael Showalter) as his accomplice, George H. W. Bush (which is played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best are the side paths.
It's especially fun to see the ancient Paul Rudd, with a shaver under the lower lip, or Matt Dillon's "soul patch" in Singles.
The moments of random madness may take this series on as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its last scene, a group of friends go to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
On the other hand, the Amazon Comrade Detective series appeals to another type of nostalgia: The Americans series’ cold war spirit, the Atomic Blonde movie and even the Global W series’s wrestling response, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas. It has been made a Romanian police drama in which the Bucharest cop couple fights for truth, atheism and Marksism Leninism.
In the main, as a tough-faced Gregor and an idealist, Iosefina is seen in Florin Piersic Jr and Cornelius Ulici. Their lines have been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (the leading producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But that's all it is.
There are some good visual jokes (cops spend time watching TV chess the same way Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous audio actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
Comrade Detective, however, is too caught up in the imitation of a clumsy socialist drama – a killer hiding behind Reagan's mask, for example. That's why the show is often starting to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough or rich.
In conclusion, the series could work better as an agitprop satire, even when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby to take out burgers.
The message to the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make all consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginary Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we were abhorred by our own recent history and their history.
The Kouvolan Toni Tauru will rise in the ring in Macao on Saturday against the former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight up.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone in Macao, because Issa, a Brazilian Leandro, was still fighting in UFC last year.
The Brazilian also has the black belt of the Jew and the World Cup of the Species.
For once, I fight against my parents.
It's a funny story. 32-year-old Tauru tells me.
The Kouvanian was supposed to be in the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The fight was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three battles were brought to Macao, China's Autonomous Community in a timely manner.
Taurus has never encountered such a thing before.
This was the first time my fight was cancelled.
It upsets me because preparation and training took a lot of time.
The fighter, however, is pleased that a new date has been set for the struggle.
A week's wait doesn't have much effect on preparation.
The transplant doesn't affect the condition, because it doesn't get any better in a week.
You know, it could get worse if you practice too much.
In a few previous struggles, Taurus has faced opponents whose strengths are in the struggle.
This time, the situation is different.
Issa is described as a typical Brazilian.
He's a rather aggressive fighter.
I'll bet he'll come up hard in the first round and try to get him to the carpet.
He's won the world champion of the Jew, so he knows how to wrestle.
The last match of Kouvolian did not go as planned.
The Philippines, Kevin Belingon, struck Taurus badly in the eye, and the Philippines had the victory.
I've never fought so hard in my life: he didn't get a single shot.
When I left, he hit my angle.
It's been a long time.
New motivation
Some freelancers fight once a year, some rise more often in the ring.
For example, the future opponent Issa fought the last time in September.
Taurus, on the other hand, had three fights last year.
This is the second battle of this year.
Sometimes the pace has gotten pregnant.
I've been working out in the past few years and I've been in good shape all along.
But I've only fought for fighting.
When a 32-year-old heard about a future encounter, he decided to change the scenery for a moment.
I was in Espoo training, and I got the pleasure back.
We got really good workouts with a guy from Sweden.
The training was a great help, for on Saturday a Kouvolan will have to prepare for physical struggle.
I've been training against opponents of the same size and training for a vertical match.
Being upright is the main tactics of a 32-year-old.
I'm gonna have to hit him rationally.
If there's a chance, I'll go take the property myself.
Lower exports must not be given free of charge, as they consume the most.
Macao attracts Taurus who had fought in China before.
They say it's Chinese Las Vegas.
I think there's a big, nice evening ahead of us.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that it will keep interest rates unchanged once economic growth has been unrelented and the stagnation of inflation has stopped speculation at interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to slow down, and that the Bank has moved interest payments because of the increased pressure on the income level of families.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s Monetary Policy Commission decided by 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, which was less supported this month because economic growth has been unenhanced.
In its quarterly inflation survey, the Bank decreased its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6%. It also warned that more pressure on household income levels is being put on, as inflation is expected to continue to rise by close to 3% in the autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest purchases are needed in the coming years to curb the inflation that Brexit has driven, and the Bank also announced that the cost of loans could be increased more than expected on the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package, which began to take place a year ago in the wake of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to offer low-cost financing to banks through the programme, i.e. a total of GBP 15 million.
The Bank's interest rate decision protocol states: "According to the Financial Policy Committee's forecast, the slow development of GDP will continue over the next few years as household real income declines consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for a 'some degree of tightening' of monetary policy in order to curb inflation to the expectations of the market 'a little wider'.
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increases would be 'staged' and 'limited'.
In May, the Bank predicted an increase of 1.9 per cent for this year and an increase of 1.7 per cent for next year.
It now kept its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The pound was weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound decreased by 0.5 per cent and was $1.31, compared to the euro it weakened by 0.4 per cent and was EUR 1.11 per cent.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was taken after lower than expected growth rates were reduced by higher expectations than interest payments. GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, but is increasing slightly at the end of the year.
According to the Bank, the situation is getting worse before it becomes better.
The Bank added that monetary policy cannot prevent a fall in income in the coming years; however, it expects wage developments to recover "substantially" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong increase in demand for British products as a result of a weak pound, which will reverse some of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after interest rates were calculated to 0.25% following the shocking result of the EU referendum, which dropped the pound.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be visible in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Prior to the latest decision by the central bank, interest purchases had become increasingly demanding as inflation tightened the pressure on households, with three decision-makers demanding a 0.5% increase in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June. However, according to the Bank, it was expected and inflation is tightening again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the overrun of its two-percent target was due to a "total" weakness.
"In view of the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be tightening up even more when creditors are hotly looking for customers and want to end the year strongly," says Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"Market looks particularly good to those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end; the renewal agreements are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also useless alternatives available."
NHS is prescribed to 10,000 people on controversial HIV medicines
As of September, patients can be prescribed a ‘reversible’ anti-HIV medicine. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute concerning the financing of the medicinal product in the English public health system (NHS).
The NHS reported that Pre-exposure Prevention (PrEP) treatment (PREP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three years of the experiment.
The NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the Court of Justice maintained the Supreme Court judgment last year, according to which NHS is able to pay the PrEP drug, although it claims that the local authorities should finance it.
Simon Stevens, Director of the NHS in England, called the announced "a significant new intervention" on Thursday and was described by the National AIDS Organisation as "a crucial moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to start receiving registrations for an experiment that will be extended to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full size in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) treatment should be given before sexual intercourse, which reduces the risk of infection.
Experience has shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV demand in at-risk groups.
The medicine taken before intercourse means that during intercourse there are sufficient drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection.
You can take the medicine daily or two hours before you have sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgenders, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
The clinics choose to meet the conditions of the trial applicants for men, women and transgenders and those who are not known to receive antiretroviral therapy for their HIV-positive partner.
People living in England who have registered for general medical treatment can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs GBP 10 million, and this week the NHS of England signed a contract for medicinal products after an international tender.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of the PREP medicinal product by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its target, uptake and delivery.
"This significant new intervention should complement and enhance existing, diverse and increasingly effective measures to prevent HIV," says Stevens.
"It is yet another significant achievement in the battle that has lasted for more than 30 years to solve one of mankind's greatest health challenges."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, Director of the National AIDS Organisation.
"If PrEP is correctly targeted at those who need it and those who are at risk, it can have a reversible effect on their HIV epidemic in England.
As of September, the risk group will be able to obtain, through an experiment funded by the NHS, a drug that they can decide independently on without the need to negotiate with the partner, with the effect that this will improve the lives of a very large number of people.
This was welcome news."
"Now it is important to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and that no one in the risk group is excluded from it," says Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The trial drug PrEP has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the PrEP trial is a welcome event, which was delayed in vain for several months due to the slowing of the government," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the Shadow Government.
"We have evidence that the medicine can have a reverse effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of the PrEP medicine.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible across the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get one step closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has been stopped."
Quality of life: the middle layer and smart interior solutions have made a spacious home from a small Earl's Court apartment
The former banker Joanne Leipzig, who was excited about the renovation of the property, moved from Knightsbridge's residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna's age-style house. The success of the renovation is explained by the fact that Joanne hasn't packed and changed her combs yet.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price class.
I went to the apartment display and noticed that the rooms were as high as they were in my apartment back then.
"I was as soon as I liked it, and I made an offer the same day."
Since then, about 90 square blocks of apartment has experienced a complete transformation.
It was a twin with only access to the bedroom from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and an interlayer to make use of the height of the room.
"I wanted space, big windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands," he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed Planning Office in Notting Hill. Erfan was assigned to use the room space of nearly four metres tall and to create an apartment, which would not only be a refurbishment and sale site but also a home.
The height of the room was not quite enough for two double spaces, so the challenge was to build a middle floor where you could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"Steel structures are pretty complicated.
The facilities had to be arranged over and over again, so that there was no need to cry in them.
The structures had to be adjusted in such a way that the height was just right both above and below them."
Erfan was able to place two full - height rooms over and over with fascinating details.
In the middle floor, the copper-like window of Retrouvius opens in an elegant living space.
Mirrored furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage luminaires create a characteristic style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, the feeling of the space and light.
The mirrors on each end of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window with a view of the other room.
The mirrored furniture of the entrance has a storage space for Joanne’s meals and glassware.
More stylish is the fact that the kitchen can be hidden when it is not used.
Kitchens equipped with a folding door are not a new solution,
But what is unique in Joanne's kitchen is that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of planning," Erfan says about the steel-enhanced MDF door.
"It's balanced, which means it slides very easily when it's lifted."
With reasonable use of space and storage space design, Joanne received 16 extra squares, a second bedroom and a better floor solution.
"When selling the property, the surface area solves – or the value of the property," Erfan says.
"In the underlying case, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the surface area."
In Joanne's apartment, the surface area was increased using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the room.
"The resident is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotional bond to the apartment is partly generated by them," Erfan says.
"No one's attached to the power lines in the walls.
They're important too, but not the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example of how good design and additional quadruples can make the basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you don't want to move out of the apartment anymore.
A pregnant princess named Sofia beamed in her summer look.
Princess Sofia's hometown hit the button.
Princess Sofia was the last to represent Sweden in Båstad before giving birth.
For dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a light blue dress.
Sofia represented on the occasion as smiling.
Swedish Princess Sofia has been visiting the Swedish Båstad this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia was represented at the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a gorgeous blue body - styled dress that was wonderfully dressed as a pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last representation event in which Sofia represents her before giving birth.
His calculated time is September.
For the event’s dinner, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed beautifully.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish small bag.
The pastel blue suit is a fine princess.
Sofia has been on a mission this week in Båstad, Sweden.
Sofia filled her apartment with a small bag.
Sofia was literally radiating in her fresh summer look.
Sofia was excited to even talk to the photographers at the event.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said, laughing and referring to the rest of her pregnancy.
He's raising us with a sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a home of Thai food appeared in Lahti Square.
The Lahtis didn't dare to taste it. They walked by.
At home, Panya Sumsri-Pentila sold food, among the friends of Panja.
He did not know much about Finland, and at that time the Finns did not know Thai.
Since the people were afraid to go to dinner, Panjah offered free taste.
So he taught the Lahti to eat Thai food, spring roll at a time.
Taste, he said.
I'm trapped in the valley.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997 Panja opened her Thai food business in the Lahti Chamber of Commerce.
There were two small tables, I think there were less than 20 customer seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you're hungry and where you're limited, you can't leave a chair empty between you and a stranger.
We were a little bit more familiar with each other, and we became friends.
Finally, I sat at the plate with the dictionary to learn from Thai.
Two years went by the mall, but then the restaurant had to change because the spices they made themselves smell too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the end of the store.
There's room.
Now we jurors are allowed to sit on our own tables again, only in the most busy times we have to shyly ask the guests if there is room next to them.
Panja knows her client.
They'll tell him where they've been and who they've seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He's seen the customer's life stages vary and the food company changes.
He remembers what a man named I went to eat my first spring roll.
She remembers me as thin and fat, and she remembers how I was when I was young.
It’s nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit next to the kitchen door, and switch to Panjah on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing he gives us.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with a sweet chili sauce.
In addition to our sense of taste, he has opened our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many people are talking to him about Thai thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's been having a hard time, he's always kind.
He's busy.
He goes to the restaurant and he goes into the fungus and blueberry.
Last week at the restaurant was a small celebration of two decades.
We customers got Strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention, this important day went by work.
The discovery of the underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to attack Europe
From the beginning of the year, the security authorities received a list of key elements of anti-terrorist work.
The list contains more than 170 Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 persons and the document contains not only their personal data but also images of each person.
Of the persons mentioned in the list, more than 130 are Iraqi, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The remaining ones are Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhistan and Saudi Arabia.
The night-Sanomat told me about the list and a couple weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information contained in it have become more accurate.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi military special forces found a list of terrorists' personal data and images when investigating the underground base of the terrorist organisation in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all security authorities in the European countries in May.
In the background, there was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after the fall of Isis in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and images of all persons, but also their date of birth, their invented aliases and information about the person's home country.
The list also specifies the specialties of terrorists.
For example, in the case of a German 27-year-old Sami J., the battle name Abu Assid al-Almani, a German, is listed.
He was reported to have left Germany in 2012 traveling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later to Turkey to join the Isis ranks.
Next to his picture, a suicide bomber has been written as a specialty.
There's no more detailed information on the man's fate.
A total of about 6 000 fighters have left Europe in the ranks of Isis, whose fate is uncertain.
The man sank under the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
According to the interviews at the rescue center, he wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
On Thursday, in Tokoinranta, Helsinki, a person was saved under water.
According to Ville Estlander, the firefighter of the Helsinki Civil Protection Agency, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The rescue diver found him under the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue agency received a notification after 3:30 p.m.
The person was delivered to emergency care.
Estlander says it was a man about 50 years old.
According to the interviews, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Mr Estlander thanked the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Guard.
There were also excellent guides to the divers.
It was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars hit nine people in Eura, three were seriously injured.
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom were injured less easily, says the firefighter.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident took place at the crossroads of three roads at four o'clock in the day.
The crash happened when the second car turned behind the warning triangle in front of the second car, says the firefighter.
According to the rescue unit, there's an hourly limit of 80 kilometers in the intersection area.
Brothers fighting over $500 million in real estate
Two brothers argue about Victoria’s largest real estate empire worth more than $500 million, and the dispute relates to the family business of their Italian family 40 years ago.
The former head of Carlton’s football club and real estate developer Colin De Lutis live only three houses away from his younger brother Paul in the Torah value zone. The younger brother has taken the Supreme Court to dispute the division of property and business property between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the divorce.
The brothers and their mothers, Anna, together own 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, and the family began to build up property when they bought a store on Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family established a Westco Jeans store that expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, property development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres in suburbs.
According to the agreement with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul describes his father as "the power and central character of the family".
According to the legal documents, the asset-sharing ratio means that Colin owns approximately $316 million in real estate and $176 million in Paul.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first sworn certificate to the court in 2015.
The case was first dealt with last Friday in the Supreme Court after several mediation companies.
The brothers are now also arguing about who is in charge of the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says it's not true, but he's accusing Paul of mismanagement of some real estate.
Colin, together with his first sworn testimony, writes that he would like to find a solution.
"In line with our Italian traditions, my family is most important to me," Colin says in her opinion.
There are hundreds of pages of sworn statements, e-mails and reports. The case is being investigated by consultants such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicious shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral for the family to buy a property in Collingwood, where Colin founded the family's first jeans store.
Colin says that he established a trade "in the last few years of high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the property to their sons in harmony.
"Luigi often said that he did not want the brothers to end up in court," Anna wrote in her statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "discontinued financial conditions".
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is a former member of the board of the Australian football league and a TV star Eddie McGuire's best friend according to this biography published in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, and he said in his text that there was no right way to comment on it, because it's being dealt with in court.
"It's very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag my family into a legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accept the demands of his brother.
"Our father would not have liked us to argue this way," Colin continued and said that he wanted to see a solution.
On Friday, hope seemed to have passed out.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new head of staff is going to limit the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can finally make it.
First.
According to Poltico, the new Chief of Staff of the White House intends to limit the media use of President Trump and the follow-up to the news, so that the boss is not so often in trouble.
Editor Josh Dawsey reports:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with the management staff on his first working day, he raised the key problem he intends to solve: he intends to limit access to information from President Donald Trump.
Kelly told the White House employees that all information – printed as well as information – must be transmitted through her because the President makes better decisions when she gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has a decades of relationship with television – and as President, he still watches a lot of TV.
"If the Presidential candidate Trump was nervous about unfair news, it was worth showing him that the media treated matters more fairly," said Sam Nunberg, who worked as a consultant at the Trump campaign, to Politico in February.
Politico journalist Tara Palmer wrote at the time that " according to six former campaign workers, it is essential that his personal media flow includes a steady flow of praise in the management of the use of Trump Twitter".
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that Trump's Twitter would never have been under control.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that we others do not know — perhaps the trumpets of Trump would have been even more fierce without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff has even been able to prevent him from causing problems a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has consistently been able to stop Trump from causing the shock.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House trying to run their cause by providing Trump with information that supports their view, which can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisors deliberately provided the President with questionable information.
The editor, Shane Goldmacher, told me about a case:
"Trump's current and former employees say that he can be frantic about the press that criticizes him – especially if they tell us about harmful information leaks. Then he must know where the information comes from.
This happened at the end of February when someone mischievously gave the President a copy of the news on the GotNews.com site set up by the online provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of several data leaks in the White House.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and withdrew them later. He also did not provide any concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had begun to read the case after he asked the staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, and the White House Staff Secretary, Rob Porter, had tried to introduce a system of document management for Trump.
And what was the result?
Kelly's gonna try the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants will continue to run their own business.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's task very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG
The Brazilian journalist Neymar has concluded a five - year agreement with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
On Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid a purchase price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, playing in the Spanish league.
Neymar’s agreement with Barcelona was therefore terminated and was free to move to the PSG of the Parisian Society.
The maximum transfer amount of € 222 million is the highest in football history.
In the past, Manchester United had a record, which paid EUR 105 million last summer for the French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatari company Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former tennis pro, the Qatari Nasser al-Khelaif.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
The success writer Raija Orange, with the hypnosis of alcoholism and fear of flight, "I'm fine with my life."
From the TV series Rose time and pure white sheets the well-known success writer Raija Orange just spent his 69th anniversary.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren hold the grandmothers so in addition to writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola apartment after 18 winters.
At first they sold their houses, but this spring they also left a rental apartment.
Light and the sun, out of the old circles, Raijan used to take away the depression and alcoholism he has survived.
Even the outer being is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonin medications were stopped, they were mood pills.
At one time, I received help in alcoholism from hypnosis, which also affected flight fear, and I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a man, a glowing writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen, who has worked in the field of tourism, has been travelling together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was marriage in two weeks, Raija laughs.
Such a drama queen she's always been, ending her life with that one, Jyrki laughs at her wife.
Orange, who made a huge career as a writer, remembers only a good 44-piece pure white sheets TV series, which touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally decided to be the business of the freshman family company in the clothing industry when I read Liisa Seppälä's 50-year interview on the plane.
I was the sewing daughter myself, my mother also had a clothing store, and sometimes I acted as a mannequin, Orane recalls.
He felt that the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of the Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelan's research and claim revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer for active time, has many manuscripts under work - hundreds of ideas.
The tourers returned over the ditch to the "Millions alley"
The most wealthy houseowners in the West Midlands are once again with persistent circulars who managed to cross the well needed by the municipality and return to the field next to the houses.
The tourers parked in their trailer near the millions of alleys in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they were able to cross the grubbing-up required by the municipality. They brought children, horses, and the army of vans.
The tourers were able to cross the barrier at a point that had not been protected because of the path.
The angry people have accused the municipality of Solihull of "the complete inability to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident reports that the circulars came from Bentley Heath on Monday night, where they had been throwing stones at passers.
"The local government needs to work hard because it seems completely incapable of solving the problem.
The tourers were here in May, and then they left, but they came back again.
There were more of them this evening and probably even more of them today."
The resident said that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the circuitists returned so soon after being driven away.
"There's more of them, and they've even landed a horse in a pasture park."
According to the informant of the municipality of Solihull, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with the Solihull police to get the campers out as soon as possible.
From the point of view of the collection of evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report to the police any disturbing or criminal activity.
It will help to provide an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
The angry people surrounded Portugal's crash machine.
Men who made forced landings on a beach full of people in Portugal have been questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of forced landing.
Two men flying the plane may be charged with death.
At the very least, it is possible to obtain 16 years of imprisonment in Portugal.
Due to the technical fault yesterday, the small aircraft operated by the men had to land on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the event, some of whom ran into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane first hit a man who had his back on the plane.
Immediately after that, the plane rose up, and when it landed again, it hit the head of the child, told Philip Janeira Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
Her parents didn't get hurt.
The people on the beach surrounded the small plane just after the crash, angry.
The girl’s father and other people went to the plane and started beating its tail, reported the case in Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal. He was desperate.
It's a miracle no more people died.
The two men on the plane were not injured in forced landing.
The tragically lost Finnish star won the World Cup again: "I wouldn't be a world champion without an accident."
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated early Wednesday morning Finland's time for MM-golds in a competition held in Big White, Canada.
Great Hamari also won the cross World Cup in the past.
In total, three MM titles have already been collected.
Pretty incredible World Cup!
Two times the gold was treated, a pretty good beat is drawn, a phone-targeted Great Hamari delighted.
A 30-year-old counter thanked his coach and a very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Great Hamari, the number of challengers in the species is increasing all the time.
The whole Paralumic Boarding has grown and developed so much lately.
The differences are decreasing, and there are a lot of newcomers.
You always wonder if there's a black horse coming after you.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Great Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
From a young age, he had been eager to count with his friends, and the accident did not lead to a desire to get to the front.
It's just that I sometimes think about what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's useless to have a jostle.
Those cards play what is shared, the Great Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to list a serious accident and the loss of a limb for luck, and that is not what Great Hamari will do.
But he turned it into a terrible difficulty.
Yeah, I'd say the situation turned into a win.
I wouldn't be a triple world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Great Hamari's biggest ferrying trip was already on the way.
It wasn't until after the accident.
When I was young, I used to work out with the guys, and we were always so excited about the X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that became somewhat drowsy over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself at the X-Games launch.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a really long life if I stayed here to be bitter and sad.
I decided to pull the hats off and get to work.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The counter was very pleased with the choice of a wheelchair player Leo-Pekka Star as a sportsman of the year.
Four-time Olympic winners won their prize in the January sports gala.
According to Great Hamari, the Star's victory is an important signal for the Para-Sports.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
I'm sure this will also open your eyes to the para-sports world.
Because it's time to launch a two-time world champion Matti-Hamar's annual sports campaign?
We'll see about that then.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Yet the Great Hamari has not conquered all the peaks he desires.
Next year, there will be a major objective.
In a year's time, the Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
They're going to get the medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their home country permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees cooking bread at refugee camps in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their home country permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Isis are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
The Trump regime does not see any change in the Syrian conflict.
The communication agency chain, Burson-Marsteller, examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international study.
For nine years, Burson-Marsteller has studied the opinions and attitudes of Arab youths.
This year the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youth aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half are men, responded to the study.
Half the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their home country permanently in the future.
42 per cent of respondents may think that they would return to their home country and 4 per cent could not say.
According to the study, the decision of young people to return home is most influenced by the war in Syria and the presence of Isis in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most important factor in a permanent return to home, whereas a quarter believe that leaving Isis would be the most important.
Only less than one-tenth of the decision will bring about an improvement in the financial situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria as the main factors contributing to the decision.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict
The Syrian youth was asked what is the most important factor in ending the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of war is more essential than the abandonment of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair quarter sees the Presidentship of Al-Assad as an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to put an end to the current conflict in Syria.
The only way to resolve the conflict through military action is to believe it's a quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugees see Isis’s power weakened during the last year, while the fifth feels that it has strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against Isis, and in general, terrorism, is that the media should give people information that Isis has nothing to do with Islamism.
Almost as many raised military measures and education reform as a priority.
In the view of a good ten, the most important thing would be to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asking about the effects of the Trump regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump regime.
Almost one in four believes that the conflict in Syria will worsen during the Trump era.
The views are divided as to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or aggravated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coded to keep the Internet in order - the database he develops uses, for example, Wikipedia and Google
The Espoo company MariaDB is developing the "fastest growing" open source database in the world.
The main product of MariaDB, established by Coder Entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs users nothing and can be developed via the Internet by any good programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge data masses remain in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they will use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there", explains Widenius.
Widenius, the technology manager of MariaDB, spends about half his time coded.
A man who works with beautiful hands helps to ensure that the Internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the most popular open source database in the world, including the Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and a year later Oracle left Sun for a 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle trade took place, a large part of MySQL's developers announced that they would leave.
"They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not make a certain promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
At this stage, he had already set up a company that began to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired a few dozen of the best developers from Sun and thus made sure the continuity of the code was secured by the same friends who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change my name.
A foundation was set up to monitor the freedom of development of the MariaDB code.
"In MySQL, these assurances were not made," Widenius regrets.
Although many have heard about Widenius and MySQL’s billionaires, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"For the last few years, our growth rate has been around 50% a year," says the financial director of MariaDB, Kenneth Paqvalé.
The growth-focused MariaDB is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is a little bit of a figure for the company.
To the extent that she reveals that during the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that she will receive orders for EUR 20 million.
As the database is free, the company has developed services around it for which business customers are prepared to pay.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be a project of more than a year if the customer has used a closed database.
The change from MySQL to MariaDB will take place in a moment because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefonica and the largest bank in South-East Asia, DBS, are customers paying for MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as the Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Albaban Cloud, offer MariaDB to its customers.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in Linux operating systems distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
"Our customers include the world's largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central bank", Paqvalé's list.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with closed databases.
Oraclelle too, MySQL is a modest branch compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although the research company Gartner claims that the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, players such as MariaDB, measured in terms of turnover, are still negligible, although rapidly growing, because they are.
In the database market of about 50 billion dollars, the open source databases do not even reach one billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in money, as most users do not pay anything for these software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies are already developing more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been exchanged or at least a start would have been made at that time.
Large companies do not receive new customers, as the majority will next select an open source code.
This has resulted in licence fees for commercial databases jumping into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as previously with a smaller number of customers," Widenius wonders.
As the exchange of closed databases is difficult, most of the customer companies have been ingesting price increases in obedience.
"There are a lot of customers to whom it is really difficult to switch because their old applications and others are stuck in a closed database," says Widenius.
Still, he believes that the size of the customers is coming full.
When license fees rise every year, the customer sooner or later enters the open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent from the previous, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
Moreover, many companies face major changes in the system when they transfer their functions to cloud services.
At the same time, many exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million from the EIB.
It was the largest growth funding ever provided by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now expected to hire more.
One reason for EIB financing was the impact of MariaDB on public procurement.
The company has public sector customers in, for example, Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros per year from databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more effectively," says Paqvalén.
Widenius is upset how money is spent in Finland on closed healthcare systems, for example, when open systems are cheaper, and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one of the software companies.
Some say that an open source code is an ideology, but I think it's a better way to make a code.
The community helps and does things that you can't, or can't, come up with.
55-year-old Widenius is one of the most well-known promoters of the open source code, along with another Finnish developer, Linus Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies to develop operational business models over an open source code.
I am still holding 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this issue.
Italy tightens its attitude towards civil society rescue ships
Italy has warned NGOs that they will rescue refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean that they will not continue to operate unless they undertake to comply with the new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to operate", said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with La Stampa, Turin.
The warning came the day after the Italian authorities had seized the vessel of the German Jugend Rettet, a crew suspected to have cooperated with smugglers who contributed to illegal immigration.
Only a year ago, an aid organization refused to comment on the detailed charges of the prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosion.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important, and we are very sorry that we are not able to operate in the search and rescue area at the moment", said the organisation in its opinion published in social media.
"We will only be able to assess the charges once we have compiled all the necessary information and will be able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had observed the Jugend Rettet from October onwards.
The crew is suspected to have taken on board a boat full of Russian refugees directly from smugglers who got the boats back into use.
One of these cases is claimed to have occurred only a few miles from the coast of Libya, as shown in the prosecutor's document published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of infringing the Italian coast guard, which monitors the rescue efforts in the region, and the motive for helping is the enthusiasm.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who supervises the activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in the search and rescue have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that they consider the new rules unnecessary but unacceptable, because they do not entail any "substantial changes or obstacles" to the organisation's civil protection activities.
The Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Organisation is among those who refuse to follow the Code of Conduct.
In turn, Minti stated that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks with rescue measures, which he considers to be evidence that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and to cooperate with local mayors are starting to produce results.
"The last few days have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that it is planned to continue this month with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
The seasonal worker was suspected of killing his common-law wife in Enontekio, the suspect was found on the scenery with the D.A.
The suspected crime occurred in Enontekio's Kuttude last December.
According to the police, a Czech 36-year-old man is suspected to have killed his 26-year-old relative in Scotland.
Previously, it's been reported that they were both seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that, after what they did, the suspect would have fled the country with two dogs.
The man was found frozen in the terrain, and he did not resist when he was caught.
We need to press charges in less than a week.
The case may still be recorded in Lapland District Court during August.
Robert Hardy, known as Harry Potter and my All-Earth friend series, is dead.
British actor Robert Hardy is dead when he's 91.
On Thursday, his family announced the death of the actor.
Hardy, born in 1925, began his acting career at the theatre at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also played in movies and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered for his role as Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter's films and his role as a veterinarian in James Herriot's book-based My Friends TV series.
The BBC’s popular series was filmed over seven years.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for text messages instigating suicide.
The Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls that were deemed to have led her boyfriend to the suicide of Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, 20, performs 15 months in prison and five years in parole.
Carter was convicted in June of murder, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13.7.2014.
"My family's broken," Conrad's father said at the Thursday session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter appealed to the judgment and was given the opportunity to wait for the application to be dealt with in freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy are suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and creamy blouses, listened to his judgment hands crucified with a weeping look on the ground created.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the D.A. said to the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to improve his own.
He hasn't taken responsibility for the act," the D.A. continued.
"He has not shown regret."
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was caused by "the shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "age or maturity level and even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions".
The D.A. reads Conrad's mother Lynn Roy's statement saying that "it won't take a day for me not to mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can survive all this. I will do my best to comfort his sister in this pain that we will always bear."
Conrad's sister, Camdy Roy, told the court that she was "sorrying" about the idea that she would never see her brother's wedding or be an aunt to her children.
"It's painful to lose a person who's been in my life every day since I was born.
The case appears to be a precedent, since there is no law in the State of Massachusetts that instigating suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in the car in 2014 when he was poisoned.
The case attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter, in his text messages, had encouraged his boyfriend to commit suicide.
"Hold yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages he had sent to Roy in the two weeks before he died. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just a little before Roy committed suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the views of the experts.
Only a few have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of his British roommate in Italy in 2007.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's paper of opinion saying, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary-General: Relations with Russia the worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, comments Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary-General of NATO, on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the Ukraine conflict.
I think that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Mr Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
However, especially after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability in Russia's eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed not to tightening up the tensions.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid aggravating the situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump was able to find that even dangerously bad levels have fallen between the US and Russia.
Mr Trump urged that we should thank the countries for their poor-looking Congress, which approved the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi is making changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to the backlash experienced by car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW offered to update more than 350 000 cars software.
The director of BMW said that the company believed that "there are more reasonable alternatives than driving restrictions". He referred to European cities, including the city of BMW's home in Munich, which are considering restricting or prohibiting the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it would make changes to the engines of more than three million Mercedes in order to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke of a recall.
European car manufacturers have made a strong market for the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to meet the CO2 targets.
Nitrous oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing equipment that neutralizes emissions will increase, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of accompanying large car companies and of ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's faults. Volkswagen installed devices that reduced emissions to standard tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Several leaders of Volkswagen have been prosecuted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the Audi engine development department, responsible for thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a possible trial.
Previously this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, and the authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in his cars that could circumvent European emission standards, based on a similar study in the United States.
Audi's investigation may significantly undermine Volkswagen's position: the manufacturer of luxury cars has a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The vote in Venezuela began with a false investigation, large demonstrations of the promise.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role to play in the election results, Tibisay Lucena, Chairman of the National Electoral Commission, said to the journalists.
Maduro assures us that the crisis will end.
In Venezuela, a controversial vote was taken on Sunday to change the constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised protests against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they are in progress at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais, the national security forces began taking over the country's parliamentary building on Wednesday night.
The troops are to ensure the safety of the appointment event.
Climate change threatens Provence's lavender
The lavender has become a symbol of the South French Provence region, but now it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender had decreased due to drought and disease - carrying insects. Researchers and farmers are trying to find a solution to the problem.
"The lavender is directly at risk in the Provence region because it has suffered the effects of climate change in recent years, which has led to a clear reduction in the rainfall in the spring and especially in the autumn," says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Crieppam research institute in Provence, which specialises in agriculture.
"This will shorten the life span of the lavender.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small piles of microbacteria into the area."
The stakes are tough.
lavender oil attracts tourists and is also a highly desired ingredient in perfume and cosmetics.
"We now have smaller flowers, which are weakly developed or weakened or missing altogether, instead of long stars and large flowers," says Chaisse.
"In other words, there are fewer parts containing essential oil."
The solution will be sought by improving irrigation, by slowing down soil moisture and by spraying plants with a mixture of clay and water, and by developing better drought-resistant varieties.
A reporter's murder represents a growing threat in Mexico.
The delivery of the Riodoce newspaper, published once a week, usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
Suppliers have been encouraged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists will discuss which one is safer: leave the children at home or bring them to the delivery that was hit by the grenade in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They're asking journalists for names for each group.
They write down the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected to be on the payrolls of government or drug cartels, who are criminals who make the chaos of Mexico life-threatening.
According to the reporters' Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 journalists under federal protection who have been attacked and threatened.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, supplier and source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote together about his many books on drug-violence.
He is deeply missed, even though he is present everywhere. The façade of the Riodoce building is covered with a huge picture of Valdez showing a middle finger. The picture says "Justice". The 30-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts decorated with the smiling faces of Valdez. Valdez has glasses and a postmarked Colony Hat.
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists will discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and fears of paranoia.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was set up, especially for dealing with journalists' cases, but only two cases have been brought so far according to the reporters' Protection Committee.
Journalists rarely have to be tried, as well as thousands of murders related to drug trafficking and organised crime per year, only rarely have to be brought to justice.
Riodoce’s journalists intend to continue writing about Sinaloa’s violence, even though they are broken by grief and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security conference is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is literally a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why."
Valdez had left Riodoce in the state capital, Culiacan, on 15 May 2017.
He had only driven a couple of blocks in his red Toyota, when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The amount is supposed to be related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove away in Valdez's car and crashed it some way away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left to mourn her wife and two grown-up children.
The rumors are moving fast, and they're free to go to Culiacan.
Valdez's death, however, is very quiet.
Sinaloo has been the bloodiest battlefield in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January. Competitive groups want to fill the void.
In the streets of Sinaloa, some or more people are shot to death every day, and the cemetery has decorative two - story funeral buildings of drug barons, which are larger than many homes.
In the state on the coast, there is “peace” when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was very aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez, feels guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damascus Lopez, leading a competing group that is fighting war against the sons of Guzman.
The case may have upset the sons of Guzman: the clients suspected to be members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine came to the points of sale.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another magazine published by the same case was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up a Riodocen with five colleagues.
In Sinaloo, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem," says Bojorquez.
In time, the magazine began to feel bold and honest about its affairs, and its sales and advertising revenues increased.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard - class research journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after his creation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for her newscast in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Prize for his courage to follow the story of drug trafficking in Mexico.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to go on with my life," he said when he received the prize of the reporters' Protection Committee.
In Sinaloo, the drug trade is "lifestyle", Valdez said at the interview with Rompevieto TV last October.
"The performer must accept a mission that falls upon him – or act stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me where I was when death was sown here – why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Riodoce’s staff miss Valdez — a joker who curses like a dock worker — they miss a friend who always gets a hug and advice, and they miss a teacher who knows how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a colossal hat.
He went to the opposite El Guayabo bar and was always sitting at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were destined for his fate.
The death of a colleague has also moved them to consider how best they can do their job and survive.
"Credits don't like it when we deal with their women and children and their clean business, their secret drug trafficking runways.
They were left out of business," says Bojorquez.
At best, it meant strong self-senior and self-defense.
Trusting your own instincts.
If you feel that everything's not right, you have to stay away.
According to Andres Villarreal, the problem with Riodoce's editor is that "the impression can be deceived, and that's what happened in Javier's case".
The old rules are no longer applicable in Sinaloo, nor do they apply to Tamaulipas, Krakow, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where the security training at Riodoce was held. A few days earlier, it had become clear that only spying programs sold to governments had been monitored by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had applied for cover in the tree shade at 40 degrees Fahrenheit [40 ° C].
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce’s premises located in a quadrilateral building in the middle-class area of Culiacan.
Some of the journalists were leavin' their half-played as to whether these two policemen were part of the 50 percent group that the governor of the state did not consider to be reliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited mountainous rural areas dominated by drug gangs.
This week's issue of Riodoce's delivery was planned for three main cases.
The size of the boxing, Julio Cesar Chavez's brother, had been killed in Sinaloo.
The magazine also intended to reveal that government spending was concentrated on the governor’s hometown.
In addition, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just a quarter away from the D.A.'s office, was kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information on who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in favour of both drug dealers and public authorities.
The journalist found out from the public documents that the restaurant was registered as a politician of the ruling institutional revolution party (PRI). PRI has ruled Mexico's policy at all levels for almost a century.
The governors involved have recently been accused of corruption in cases where there has been a great deal of publicity.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous cases in the same place. In one of them, the son of "El Chapo" Guzman managed to escape and avoid the army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they had reliable information about the kidnapping in the Valdez column.
"We would have known what had happened in the past," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been given the nickname "El Flaco" due to his body structure, Ohukainen.
"Now all connections to our sources of information are broken."
Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse that preserves anti-terrorist signs and labels. The workers of the magazine have received a new, unexpected task: they have become activists for freedom of the press.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs to the local prosecutor’s office for a demonstration, again responsible for the murder of a new journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, based on the DNA tests Adame was carried out by the authorities.
Journalists have started protesting louder throughout the country. In demonstrations, the text "SOS Press" appears on the sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to get international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
On the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists for telling the truth.
Since then, he has asked to be removed from government cases because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico journalists are surrounded by organised crime, crime is allowed by authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narcojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed by order of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to Articulo 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were police and public authorities.
"In Mexico people are silenced by killing," says Ramirez.
Murders have a debilitating effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern Tamaulipas border state six years ago.
His body had a message signed by the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my writings."
Next to his cut head was the computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the magazines have decided to close down their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the north of the border state of Chihuahua, after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue their activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Cudad Juarez published a message to drug cartels on its front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their state or country.
It's hard to make a decision.
It is difficult to find a job in exile, and we must keep watch over it all the time.
Sometimes criminals look for a reporter, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 for three months after he escaped from the city.
For those who continue their work, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was to become a poet, admitted that writing about drug trafficking scares me.
"I became a reporter because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce’s journalists sat in front of the delivery at midnight with a beer on the sidewalk when the latest issue of the magazine had been completed. Suddenly, their phones began to appear as a sign of the message.
In the shooting between competing gangs and security forces, 19 people had died on the Mazatlan beach site.
The war accelerated, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
The reporters put the news on Riodoce's website from the sidewalk on their smartphone.
I had to put the page back on the next day.
The sirens were screaming nearby — another shooting.
Bojorquez looked at the delivery of guard officers:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoce’s delivery continued the tradition of the murderous founder of the magazine under this massive portrait, where the man shows the middle finger to the whole of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says that you can't even consider stopping. "How could I stop the magazine when our intern asked me to get out on the street and do a case the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge setback on "The Hard Place"
In April, Hannu Manninen’s festival was short, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period began disastrously when Manninen was infected with the flu.
It started a long period of illness that lasted for almost five weeks.
In fact, May went to a state full of illness.
At first, there was a flu, and in the end, a paediatric disease like an ear infection in which I had to eat an antibiotic course.
I was only able to do 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been so sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I didn't get the benefit of the exercise, and Manninen tells Ilta-Sanom.
Test result collapsed
The World Champion of 2007 was only granted a training permit in the second week of June, which was shown in the KIHU roller test performed on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis with rollers, whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a sample of lactic acid from the athlete’s fingertip with the needle.
Last fall, I had to take 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
A wall came up, Manninen tells me.
To the right
After the initial rights, Manninen tells me she's been healthy.
I have performed a wide range of peaceful aerobic exercises that I have tried to normalize body metabolism.
Now there's a really good five-week period in the back.
It was also a week and a half off flight duty.
My family and I also have time to visit the cabin.
Last season Manninen took part in only four World Cup competitions before the Gulf World Cup.
The best result was seen in the opening competition as Manninen rose on top skiing to 18.
Guidelines drawn
The main coach of Manninen and the country team, Petter Kukkunen, has prepared a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now applying for different rhythms compared to the last season.
After the first race, Ruka would have a weekend of three World Cups.
In December, the intention would be to attend at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans would still be in Seefeld.
I hope you find the name on the Olympic team's list after that, Manninen says.
The Olympics in Pyongchang would be the sixth Winter Olympics in the career for Mann.
Now, the most important thing is to stay healthy, Salt Lake City, 2002 gold in a team race celebrating the nummelian underline.
Dinosaurus protected himself from his enemies by masking
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now the researchers have revealed the first findings of a creature the size of a rhinoceros found by a Canadian miner, which had been so well preserved that the experts call it Mona Lisini of the dinosaurs.
It had been preserved so well that the researchers were even able to determine that it had a reddish-brown skin and had a 'problematic past'.
According to Current Biology, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur and the best representatives of its species in the world.
The recently found fossil is a nodosaurus, which lived in the mid-terms 110 to 112 million years ago.
Researchers consider this amazingly well - preserved fossil to be a truly significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, the armored vegetarian is the most preserved fossil of all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in North Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock and decided to examine its discovery in greater detail.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to Tyrrell’s Royal Paleontological Museum.
There the beast was dug out for six years out of a 1 100 - pound block.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
"If you shake your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says the scientist Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrell.
"It remains in the history of science as a dinosaur Mona Lisana, one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaurs.
Skin studies revealed that meat - eating dinosaurs were likely to be a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had a armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red and white armor masks it from predators, and it was also protected by a darker and lighter colouring under the top, which is still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to blend in with its environment and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million - year - old nodosaurus rose to the headlines in May and is now on display at Tyrrell’s Royal Paleontological Museum.
Researchers have named it Borealope Markmitchell Museum Engineer Mark Mitchell. Mitchell was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig up the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so surprisingly well that Mitchell and the international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body's scales and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a general coloring, with a darker and lighter body under the skin.
However, the observation was a surprise because Boreaope is considerably larger than the current animals with similar coloring.
It can be concluded that the meat - eating dinosaurs preyed so much that evolution favours hiding instead of fighting as a means of survival.
For example, the current animals have the same coloring, which is considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that nodosaurus was also under serious threat.
"The prey of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells how dangerous the dinosaurs of the alliance were," Brown says.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of Nodosaurus' scales reveals that its skin was reddish.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions from its life. Among other things, they study the contents of its intestines to find out what it ate with its last meal.
Scientists believe that it fell into the river when it died and drifted to the sea where it sank on its back to the bottom of the sea.
Alberta was as warm then as she was today in Florida, and the rivers and seas were likely far beyond what is now.
"This nodosaurus is really important because it has survived and has survived three-dimensionally in its original form," Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early accession period.
To picture it does not require much imagination: if you shake your eyes a little, you can almost believe that it was sleeping."
The era of teropods, huge two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, or millions of years earlier, Borealopella, may have caught this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of the Tyrannosaurus Rex included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology, and they believe that Borealope washed up in the sea after his death and mummyed into the mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in North Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armoured dinosaur with its skins and armor from heap to hip.
On average, the Nodosaurs were five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 pounds [1,300 kg].
Two six - foot - long spikes were lifted from their stage.
Researchers believe that this armored vegetarian passed through the present Western Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has preserved little details in the underwater grave.
Its fossilised remains have been preserved so well that its skin remains in the pits of the armor along its skull.
In fact, Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such a preservation is 'one rare as a lottery win.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
There's still fossilized leather in the deep plates of its skull pan.
Its right foreleg is on its side, five toe up.
I can also count the scales of its foot."
How did an activist learn to answer the question: Who do the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
He had arrived in New York the day before from his home in St. Louis and sat on the bed of his airbnb apartment browsing Facebook with his phone.
That's when he noticed the message from his high school friend:
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy, and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information in his feed. That's why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retreadings from @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a rapper in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death, and the White Police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
This user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he got back to Twitter later that night, people were told there was a crowd on Canfield Drive.
The users posted pictures of police tapes and screaming people, and Brown's father, the man who claimed to be himself, who was wearing the sign said, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell was following a real-time video of the police standing in front of the protestors with a barking dog.
He also tells me that he saw a video of another cop tuning his rifle and screaming, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers he said.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we're used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt the cold colors.
I was angry and I cried."
He booked a flight home for the next day.
Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter's father and decided to leave for Ferguson the next morning.
Since what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next almost three years, the documentary film "Whose Streets?" was made, and it received its premiere in film theaters on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and expression of mind, love and loss, and strength and perseverance from the point of view of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with his daughter, dressed in a crown compatible with it, they again held a discussion on "what it is like to live black and under what conditions". They had spoken about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't leave my daughter with me," Ferrell told me later.
"Today's events are the climax of events in the past.
My daughter has the right to know it and to grow into it.
He must have the ability to activism and to organise, but he must also feel the different layers and conditions of the experience of living black, and he must know what we must do to free ourselves.
Fortunately, though I have been able to protect him from gross racism, he is still the same as other black girls.
I feel like I'd hurt her if I protected her from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was the South Florissant Road, which is located opposite the police station. It became a camp site for activists, waiting for information on the case to be dealt with and finally finding out that the police would not be prosecuted.
From there Ferrell and his daughters went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunch in bags and distributed it to protestors.
Ferrell gradually started to take a new approach to activists.
"Activism changed completely after the 9th of August," she says. When she studied at Missouri University in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of the minority health care students' organization. At that time she focused on food law and health differences in black communities.
"I didn't have the experience of organizing myself.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the document assistant director at the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar " simply wanted to tell" what was happening.
He said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
The suspicion was based on countless times when people appeared in the local community, usually white people who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We've heard that the people born and raised in Ferguson didn't have a common voice," Folayan recently told us at the interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, who is known for his activity among prisoners sentenced to death.
Davis's involvement led Ferrell to join the project together with six other locals, and the photo team followed events in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This is not a document where someone talks to us or speaks for us, but we speak for us," Davis says.
"The most important thing for me was how local people are being played in a movie because I'm being played in the same way."
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, because it was to show that the people's movement was 'not about a charismatic leader, but about a community'.
That is why the document finds surprising private aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when he tells me what it felt like to see a movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human characterisation of black people require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story once again brings back the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police shot the black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement are identical to the queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept up the whole movement," Ferrell says. "It is because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees: "The movement is truly maintained by black women, including many queer women."
He stressed, however, that Ferrelli was not chosen for the document 'self-intended' because of his queer identity.
"He triggered energy," Folayan says.
"It is no coincidence, however, that he was in the front line. Black queer women live at the point of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen."
The news crews have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the relationship between the community and the police is still tight.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of parole left, and he was convicted of blocking the highway in a demonstration.
His description of the social policy climate in his home corner is short and concise: "A mess."
Yet he still trusts the slogan he learned outside Ferguson streets three years ago:
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains."
Suitable similarity: the artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York has hung faces – white, black and brown faces – in the middle of the exhibition space.
These 30 works are portraits taken by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples of Fort Leavenworth's prison, where he was serving 35 years in prison. Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on August 2, 2017.
It is a two-year exchange of letters between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transverse and pioneeringly dissident, whose prison sentence was relieved by Barack Obama on the third day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzes Manning's DNA algorithmically and creates 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, though slightly theoretical position on the customization of DNA data, on the multiplicity and on the underlying causality and identity.
Chelsea Manning, born in Bradley Edward, has openly stated that she has identified women since puberty. She was found guilty of 20 crimes in 2013 including violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning sentenced to prison: a granular, black-and-white selfie, where the troubled Manning sits in the car at the driver's seat. He has a platinum light wig on his head, which became his badge.
Dewey-Hagborg had behind him a very popular Stranger Visions project in 2015, which he carried out in 2012.
That's where he created portraits based on forensic data, and he got DNA from, for example, tobacco jams and gums, and created images of what the people in question could have looked like.
Then the artist got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture for their story," Dewey-Hagborg told me at a new exhibition at the press conference.
He couldn't visit Manning, and he couldn't be photographed in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making a DNA image of Manning.
The artist and his incarcerated muse suddenly became correspondence friends, and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even made together a Suppressed Images comic book, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, describing the future in which the president would have relaxed Chelsea's sentence and he would be able to watch the exhibition.
In fact, Obama shortened Manning’s sentence only a few days after the publication of the comic book, a fortunate coincidence after seven years in a civil prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened right now, as Donald Trump wages his own war against informants and transgender soldiers and finds new ways to strengthen the powerful divides he was actually supposed to loosen up on Twitter.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that everything has its purpose.
On the wall of the gallery there is a statement by the artist, and below it is a great initial of Manning, which has the heart as the point of the last name i. In its opinion, the artist demands the end of the "automatic division on which sex, race, sexuality and culture are based".
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence: a long line of letters C, G and A written with a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotide, as the scientific definition used by the artist – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are, at least from our biology.
"I hope that my exhibition will help people to understand that we are equal from our genetic heritage and that genetic data are very personal and transparent for interpretations," says Dewey-Hagborg. His Spurious Memories video book of 2007.
"Dna tells countless stories, and there are 30 of them here."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: page from Manning and Dewey-Hagborg’s comic book.
That's where Manning's character comes out of prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they can slow you down, they've won," says the picture.
"Never shut up."
"The text is from the letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold colors."
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he was greeted by faces based on his own genetic data than by a group of protestors in the middle of the exhibition room.
It is deliberate, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, the Manning DNA period is written with a pencil at a height equal to its length (157.5 cm).
"The faces were on the wall before, but I wanted to bring a crowd of people into them," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to describe the mass movement created by Chelsea, which was also behind his release."
Professor of Northwestern University and employee at Oxford University are wanted for murder.
The police report that they have launched a national search to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who is suspected of stabbed a man to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
The documents of Cook County Court show that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the records, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local bulletin published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
Police alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple carvings in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene of the incident and the stab wound is being investigated as a murder, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Norwegian University since 2007.
In its opinion sent by e-mail, the Deputy Director for Social Relations at the University, Alan K. Cubbage, stated that Lathem is now on administrative leave and is denied access to the Northwestern campuses.
"This is a criminal case investigated by the authorities, and the Northwestern University helps with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
The opinion sent by e-mail from the University and Somerville College informants states that "we have been in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the authorities investigating the case in the United States in all possible ways."
The opinion also stated that Mr Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
Anthony Guglimi, head of information at the Chicago Police Department, said that he called on the suspects to surrender seriously to the authorities.
"Police have an idea of where they are, and we are constantly specifying our search," Guglimi said.
According to Guglimel, local, regional and national authorities will assist in the search for suspects.
He told me that the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received an vague tip that something had happened in the apartment of 1008.
The police described the scene as terrible.
According to Guglimel, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered the same day or earlier.
He told me the security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," says Guglimi.
The Grand Plaza Executive Group published this brochure to the residents: "The police are currently investigating the progress of events and the victim's background, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
He threatened to blow up Islamic bookstore and kill Muslims in London.
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," the convicted said to the police.
Moffatt must provide a hundred hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of his threats to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims."
According to the Independent magazine, David Moffatt was convicted of, among other things, gross harassment.
According to the police, the bookstore staff alerted them on May 23rd.
According to the staff, the man had threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims.
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police about the threat.
The threat was nothing to do with what happened in the bookstore.
The authorities noticed that Moffatt was dressed in the same position as the suspect in the bookstore, the police informant said.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic, Moffatt told the police in interrogations.
As a penalty, a man must provide a hundred hours of unpaid social service and pay £620, i.e. about €690 in legal expenses and £85, i.e. some €95 in compensation to the victims.
According to Scotland Yard's informant, several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will complete the work of the WADA road map in the near future" – Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Vitaly Mutko
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Vitally Mutko, has said that Russia will soon complete the World Anti-Doping Agency's WADA road map to restore the mandate of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission, RUSADA.
"Part of the measures under the road map have already been taken, and RUSADA was entitled to design and test in cooperation with UKAD, the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard", said Mutko on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which lays down the conditions for restoring the mandate of RUSADA. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to the formula, it does not contain anything worrying about Russia.
"All has been announced and all will be carried out.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
However, one of the points on the road map requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities publicly accept the findings of the investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, appointed by the WADA.
To that, Mutko said: "The study is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no government programmes, and we cannot admit what did not exist."
The words of the Mutkon contained echoes of the opinion of Vitaly Smirnov, Chairman of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian RSport sports media earlier on the same day, admitted that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping organs. "We have said several times that there are controversial positions and regulations in the report.
We are not going to adopt the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to cease its doping surveillance in Russia in November 2015, after the scale of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to design and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, the Director of WADA Olivier Niggli visited the headquarters of RUSADA in Moscow. After the visit, he stated that the organisation was on the "right path" towards restoring powers.
The British organisation sceptical about the beloved innovation of Finns: there is no evidence of health benefits of maternity packaging
The British organization doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity kits.
Among other things, the BBC and the Guardian report that the Lullaby Trust, which fights hidden deaths, prohibits the use of their own brochures in maternity packages distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some regions.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity pack reduces the risk of hidden death.
Cod death means an inexplicable sudden death of a baby.
Lullaby Trust is an expert on health services in Britain in the safe sleep of a child.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed in them, because it would allow us to understand that we are recommending this product, the organization announced.
In Finland, there is one of the lowest numbers of infant mortality in the world, only two dead per thousand born.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as the small number of teenage pregnancys.
The fact that each family is given a box may be one factor.
However, that cannot be said for sure, Francine Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity packaging is marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and death.
Maternity package is a Finnish invention and has been given free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The pack contains a variety of accessories, such as clothing for children.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all security standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no security standard for cardboard boxes as a place to sleep.
According to Lullaby Trust, packaging can be the best option for a place to sleep if no balconies or bed is available.
The organisation recommends that the package be used only for nap purposes and stop using it at the time the child is able to turn around.
The organisation also recommends keeping pets out of the packaging and ensuring that they do not get wet or dirty.
Vihä konna ran away again from the Japanese zoo
The Japanese zoo staff are looking for a deported turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at their speed and already ran away for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle ran away from Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, Western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the frog left the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned about Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo.
The runaway 35-year-old frog is female, 55 kilos and about a meter long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During opening hours, the frog is allowed to travel freely in the garden area.
The zoo has not received any visual findings from the turtle.
The last escape of the frog happened the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your company to avoid Uber errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees in her start-up business, but the questionnaires didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured me that the questionnaires were anonymous, some workers were suspicious of them.
“The surveys were simply not consistent or objective,” says Errett. As his hair care company Madison Reed focuses on e-commerce. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to use outside help.
New types of start-ups in the human resources administration have increasingly come to the market to help other companies find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software to measure employees' commitment. Companies can conduct surveys and target specific teams and population groups and provide anonymous reporting services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with the government.
"Your health can be monitored by applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where does Fitbit stay?" asks the founder and CEO of the Glint Startup in Redwood City, Jim Barnett. Glint offers companies analytics software to measure employees' commitment.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years, telling us he's had a deeper view of the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program can make quick enquiries and votes for certain teams, and it can also create a map that can be seen at a glance in which departments workers are more dissatisfied and which leaders have the weakest estimates, which is why Errett has been able to drill into the core of the problems.
Companies have understood that they must follow the culture of work so that they do not become the next Uberia. The transport company has been around since the former employee wrote in his blog about the culture where workers are being harassed and people who talk about problems are being punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, such negligence is an attractive business opportunity.
Business governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry whose value may, according to the Let's Talk Payments website, increase to over USD 118.7 billion by 2020.
Convertcent, located in the state of Colorado, Denver, is a start-up that helps companies to detect and prevent inappropriate behaviour.
Convertcent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently concluded a deal with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to make tailored surveys, collect answers in a confidential way in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, workers may report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by means of a text message.
And if there is reason to suspect that the director is involved, the complaints go directly to the company’s administration.
"The public opinion has cast aside the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of the Convercent.
He points out that if the company treats its employees badly or does not act ethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company and it can also lose workers and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations. The company has been using Convertcent for over a year because it wants to ensure that the employees are aware of the policies and procedures and are easily connected to the head office.
In the past, the practice was that if an employee wanted to report the problem, he had to first find out the telephone number or the e-mail address that he was able to report to the head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.
"It was often a scary and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, law director at Ruby Tuesday.
The problems were previously hidden from leaders in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the reality of the employee," says Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
At the same time, we protect our shareholders from legal proceedings relating to employment relations.
According to Quinlan, companies started to take ethics, values and employee commitment more seriously after Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of his unethic activities in the Enron scandal.
It was only with social media that the companies realized that they could no longer prevent the public investigation of their laundry.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came to ethical control," says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service that is regularly charged for its use.
It is a business model and an opportunity accepted by capital investors, both Glint and Convercent are supported by capital investors.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised a total of $47 million in capital.
In November, Glint received €10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised a total of $60 million.
Investments are not a surprise given the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, workers expect more of their jobs.
In competitive markets such as the lax, good wages and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Workers want to feel accepted and appreciated and to give their time to a genuinely useful enterprise.
"Workers are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, director of the LinkedIn company responsible for the remuneration and well-being of employees.
Investors will make a profit when companies succeed. Companies will succeed when employees commit themselves.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employees' commitment, so it is no wonder that they are interested in investors.
According to experts in the workplace culture, knowledge of the commitment of workers is important,
but it is useless if it does not give rise to measures.
If the company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered as a sign of change.
And if the change does not come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the commitment of workers.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be prepared to have four thousand discussions," says Russell Raath, Director General of Kotter International, the management consulting company, who has seen companies have too much confidence in the collection of information.
"If the company does not take action, the workers will start to wonder if they have been consulted.
and whether their opinions matter.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Erett, Madison Reed is currently conducting monthly personnel surveys and is able to deal with the problem on the same day as Glint reports.
After collecting feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated workers, Errett was able to make changes to the teams and organise communication training to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday is better understood by its employees and hopes that a deeper understanding will help to improve the long-term sustainability of staff in an industry known for its high turnover.
"If the company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it loses employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there's no business."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of plotting his naked female neighbor, reports the news agency TT.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at her home when she noticed a cell phone hanging from the end of a rope outside her window.
The woman said the cell phone camera shot it in the apartment.
The frightened woman had run into another room to dress.
After the woman had arrived to check the situation, her cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon after that, the window was put back in again.
A 20-year-old man who's suspected of filming has admitted he's taken a picture of a woman.
But he claimed that he only photographed her face.
The video on the cell phone had been removed, and the police had failed to return it as evidence.
In interrogations, the man has admitted to the act, but he has denied to commit a crime.
His description was justified by saying that he loved his neighbor "a lot of crazy".
According to the News Office, a man will be prosecuted.
Teachers demand more lice during the autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than, for example, in the export industry, but the difference should be narrowed, said OAJ President Olli Luukkainen on Thursday.
The temporary operation of public holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements in which the review would in no way involve the provision of holiday money.
In the municipal sector, contracts should be concluded only after private sector documents have been signed and the percentages of the increase are known.
The lukewarm predicts that, for example, the OAJ's working conditions have been agreed in January.
The percentage targets were not yet revealed by Luukinen.
Luukkainen is also Chairman of Juko, a public-trained negotiating organisation.
Lukkainen: Holiday allowance surgery increases earnings differences
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show a decline in the purchasing power of employees in the public sector, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukinen, fixed-term holiday allowance surgery further exacerbates the differences in earnings.
In Finland, how many pupils per teacher can be
The OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as differences between the best and the weakest survivors continue to increase.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are decreasing and differences between pupils and regions are constantly increasing.
The day of Bruins' players was prolonged when the NSAA reduced daily exercises by two to one.
It's almost 11:00 a.m., and a bunch of UCLA football players have stayed to talk to the other side of the campus's new training fields.
Some of them have taken off their toy shirts, and their backs shine from the sweat after the first day of the training camp.
For quite a few of them, this few minutes of conversation is a midday break.
After three hours of training at the University's summer courses, players will return to the dormitories for final exams. The following morning they will meet at the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 p.m.
"The next three days will be rough for these guys," says Coach Jim Mora of Bruins shortly before Monday's shift to Tuesday.
The university’s umbrella organisation reduced the number of daily training sessions to two. The purpose of the change was to reduce the number of players’ jobs, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final tests will be held.
That's why UCLA's first three exercises started at about 15 minutes in the evening.
This year, the camp started almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in the training period of Westwood that continued through Mora six, when the exercises are held at the same time as the summer courses.
The trainings are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20th, when the actual preparation for the opening of the season will begin: UCLA will meet the University of Texas A&M in September.
Mora says she supported the change in the NCAA's rules, even though it made players' schedules even tighter.
"We load them very much for three or four days, and it's very challenging," says Mora.
"But the players are ready to work.
I think it'll make things easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA will close the exercises after the camp. It is not easy given the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking area and the Luskin Center, a high-level hotel already bombarded with football over the protective net behind the finish line.
Bruins players are scheduled to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are available to third parties.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The problem is that people can book a room and film exercises on video from there. It is not an exaggerated concern.
The video you're filming for the exercises is pretty much paid for.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We're doing our best.
I'm not going to bother my head too much about this.
We have a plan."
Freedom from Rwanda
In central Africa, Rwanda, a presidential election is held on Friday, the winner of which is already considered to be clear.
Paul Kagame is officially pursuing his third period, but in practice he has had an impact on the country's leadership since 1994.
That's when the rebel group RPF stopped the genocide organised by the extremisms.
Kagame was RPF's commander.
Kagamea has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and restricting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused of, for example, the distortion of poverty statistics.
For the third period, Mr Kagame will be able to make an effort, because the Constitution, which was limited to two periods of presidency, was changed.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuine leader.
During his time, Rwanda has undergone social reforms and international investments have flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in bringing together a country divided by genocide.
Rwanda's success has led many Africans to ask whether a liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
But also Kagame has promised his people more freedom after the land has been lifted up.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights false news by making facts checks more effective
Facebook intends to send any false news to independent fact-verifiers more and more frequently and to present the results under the original article. The world's largest social network announced it on Thursday.
The company published on its website a statement that it will start using updated machine learning to identify false news. Possible false news will be sent to the fact-finders and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the biggest spreaders of false news. Many people believe that false news influenced the result of the US presidential election in 2016.
The subject has been raised into a political debate in Europe where French voters were bombarded with fake news before the Presidential elections in May and Germany preparing for the September elections supports the plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly eliminate hostile content.
On Thursday, in a separate opinion published in Germany, Facebook announced that the verification of facts would be tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see what stories do not pass through the web of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more clearly what they are reading and sharing," said Sara Su, Product Manager of Facebook News Feed, who wrote in the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing the subject-related articles and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
The birth of a comic book: The story of a castle
The small Scottish castle in Kent's county is now known as the music video of Squeeze and Margaret Thatcher's hiding place from the 1970s and 1980s.
But it has 700 years of stormy history behind it. Now this charming place in the Bewlin River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a moped-haired writer who likes old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to study the text written by a dead person over 300 years ago," Rhodes says astoundingly.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
The book of Rhodes, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edgardian era. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoon artist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, he published Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, which were inspired by the documents of the British National Library.
"I moved into tears in a letter I noticed a thumbprint. The letter was written by a double agent working for the Jacobs in the 1700s," Rhodes says.
"It was his prints!
And the letters smell like smoke, because at that time the light was used on fire.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love archives!"
A writer attracted to old documents was allowed to stay in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Council of Arts, which felt too good to be true, and he admitted that he could not have been in the castle without delay for a little longer than he would have wanted.
He spent the days studying the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rare things, such as hyena heads hung on the walls and bottles of centuries in a mound.
He toured the ruins and premises of the old castle and discussed with the forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes with the artists who pictured the book.
In the evenings, he took whiskey and started writing.
Scotland's closer history is quite unknown, since the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussein, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff of the Foundation was just about to begin the process of going through the archives. Rhodes describes that archives had been held for hundreds of years using the same method: taking all the extra attics.
The archives had journals, letters from the English Empire and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that the land conflicts were boring," Rhodes says. "This is where the families were fighting for one birch.
I thought I'd let it go."
Some of the stories of the book are moving from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer. It tells of a man who soon after completion of the castle, relates to the English peasant rebellion in 1381.
"The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex says there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The British peasant rebellion began in the same area, and it came to mind that the rebellion could start with a riot.
Maybe these events are connected?"
Other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, the story of a priest hidden by Darrell’s family for seven years during the Reformation of England.
The Smugler, on the other hand, tells the story of the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 17th century. He is told that he staged his own funeral with stones filled with coffins (it was discovered years later when his tomb was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotland. "Family, they seem to have been quite a bunch of freaks, and they kept on going into debt and buying things they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women. I see them as handsome friends who knew how to lighten the heirs."
Now Rhodes is applying for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book on Life Mountain, a spa in the early 1900s, where only a eutrophiced plot is left.
There's a special place in his heart at Scotland Castle.
"It was sad to leave," he says.
"I didn't want to go back to this damn business."
Between Russia and the worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, comments Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary-General of NATO, on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the Ukraine conflict.
I think that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Mr Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
However, especially after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability in Russia's eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed not to tightening up the tensions.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid aggravating the situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump was able to find that even dangerously bad levels have fallen between the US and Russia.
Mr Trump urged that we should thank the countries for their poor-looking Congress, which approved the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klichko finishes the rematch against Anthony Joshua.
For the long-term heavyweight series of occupational boxing, the world champion Vladimir Klichko ends his career.
Ukrainian Klichko, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
At the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, Klichko, who hit gold, fought 69 times as a professional, winning 64 matches.
He held various MM titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klichko lost his career in the last two matches.
Tyson Fury hit him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klichko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a wild fight in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klichko were expected to meet in a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klichko did not find any motivation in the fight.
I used it on purpose to make a few weeks' decision to get me enough distance from the Wembley match, Klichko told me in his release.
As an amateur and a professional boxer, I arrived at everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never imagine having such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klichko’s reasons for deciding on the video.
Bernd Bönte, the manager of Klichko, stated in the release that the decision to terminate was difficult for Klichko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Mr Bönte said.
Klichko has been dating the American actor Hayden Panettier since 2009.
The couple have one child, a daughter of Kaya, born in 2014.
Klichko's big brother Vitali is also the former heavyweight champion.
In the years 2008-12, the brothers controlled the MM titles of different unions at the same time.
The weatherbreaker in Finland is sorcering: "Get out of the file"
Swing Jumper Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the summer’s outdoor iron period.
Minna Nikkas has had a problem with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken the woman out of her mouth.
Even the World Cup in London has unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen speaks in the weather.
Circumstances have been this summer against the wing jumper Minna Nikki.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I couldn't even get small wings to move properly, Nikkanen said after the Porsche race.
I've competed and practiced here, knowing how many times I've never experienced the same different winds in this place, Nikkanen told me about Paavo Nurmin Games.
During this period, it has been very difficult to standardise the jump, even when there have been such unstable winds in the exercises, Nikkanen said in Kaleva Games.
The weather spoke in London on Thursday.
It's been quite a challenge to get the technology together... whether it's a cold trap or something.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken away the file.
It makes no sense to consume energy under poor conditions.
He got into the World Cup because of his 455 grey jumps.
It's been 445 outside.
The situation is not the same for everyone in London.
You have to be cool and wait for a better wind.
The goal is to cross Friday's cut-off of 460.
Why don't you move on to practice abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany from the beginning.
I got a jump in the pile and the technology was standardized.
I guess I should have done the same thing now.
Normally, you've been able to practice in the hall, and now the hall's closed.
What would it be like to race?
Twenty-five degrees warm.
Just as long as it's standard.
An experienced ex-officer tossed politicians at Yle: "We have nothing to split now and for many years"
Despite the positive climate of the economy, the government of Juha Sipilä must keep ice in the hat and guard against the increase in the state budget with debt money, warning the Ministry of Finance of the budgets for decades prepared by Erkki Virtanen.
He says there's no room for division.
Yle interviewed the retired Virta in Wednesday’s 1st of Wednesday in 2015.
The state budget for next year is about to be built.
In recent times, politicians' proposals on raising the guarantee pension, on the calculation of car tax and on supporting electric wheels, among other things, are being held by Virtanen as electoral speeches.
They mainly tell us that the elections are beginning to be close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed with additional debt, we have no room for distribution now or for many years.
I think it's even a fraud to talk about sharing when the debt is taken, Virtanen said to Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debts were owed to children.
Virtas has a long experience in preparing state budgets: in 1978 he started as a budget secretary at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Head of Budgets and Budgets.
Last time he retired, he was head of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
In the interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the currently forecast growth rate of 3% is likely to be temporary.
All fortune tellers estimate that this is a thorn that will be leaving next year to go to a footnote, and Finland will be waiting for a one-percent increase of tens of years.
Washington will change the rules of the permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules of the permanent residence permit, the Green Card, would be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, to tighten the requirements of temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The bill is due to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars for taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current programme.
The new search process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy", Trump said, according to the media.
The wife of the Queen of Denmark doesn't want to be buried in the same place as the Queen.
Prince Henry doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareta.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margaree were photographed in April.
The Queen of Denmark, Margareta, 77, and her spouse, Prince Henrik, 83, are not buried side by side, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, rulers in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The Royal House has announced today that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Roskilde Cathedral, the court finds in its announcement on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
There is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, the court's communications director, Lena Belleby, commented in the paper.
The prince’s decision not to be buried alongside the queen is a natural consequence of his not being treated as equals to his mate.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of her husband’s wish for the burial place and has understood the decision.
Scary moment on the road: The car was on the highway
Tommi had a common side and two little children on board.
They were not injured in an accident, but they do not receive money from insurance if the other party is not reached.
The accident happened at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Archive image from the building site of Kehä III.
Vantari Tommi says his family survived a miracle on Tuesday in a car accident.
Tommi, his commoner, Riina, and the couple’s two small children drove on the freeway at Keimolanport in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
A white car was driving to the side of the family car, Tommi says.
If it wasn't for the exit movement, the car would've come along with Tom.
I braked and turned the car around at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tommi says.
The family's car hit the rails at a high speed.
The parents and two young children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is slightly under 3 years of age, the other is less than 1 year of age.
Apparently, it was a pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No one was driving past us, even though there was a busy traffic.
The accident happened about 5.20 p.m.
According to Tom, no one stopped at their place, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
The ambulance and rescue staff arrived, and the condition of the family was checked.
The car went into redemption.
Tommi tells him and his partner had low incomes, and they received family grants for buying a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of another car, the family says Tommi can't get money out of insurance.
Therefore, the family would like to see the Witnesses observe the car that led the family to the railing.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take the kids to the yard and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tomi saw the car was white, old car.
It was probably from the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 21st century.
He thought the start of the car registration number was SIG.
If we don't catch the culprit, I don't know how we're doing financially, we're going to have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that what's happened or what's known about it is connected to the police.
The Eastern Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Agency confirm that they have had an accident on Tuesday night.
The title and case were corrected at 21.15: Unlike what was originally told in the case, the second car, according to Tom, did not come to the lane of the incoming ones, but was to drive from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
The performance directed by Lotta Jäppinen is about human relations with humor - The self-discoverer will be seen at the What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, brings her first-born director to the What? Theatre.
The self-discoverer is a performance of music theater about past relationships and insufficientness.
Director Lotta Jäppinen says it'll still be good.
The subject will be dealt with by means of humor.
I don't think you're going to get caught up in any of the bad feelings, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the tour of the summer theatre has been carried out with a pyjamas budget and a large, young heart.
The title of the presentation is challenging to consider what a person reveals about himself when he comes to know a new person.
Do you think he'll play a role, or is the other jacket coming up?
Unbroken presentation confuses the fact and fiction
Jappinen has both directed and dramatized the show.
He's also in charge of the lights.
The presentation shall consist of the texts of the working group and shall not be in the process of doing so.
The director believes that even though the presentation draws young people out of their minds, it speaks to people of all ages.
The Jappinen stresses that the Self-discovery does not tell directly about his own and the working group's human relationships.
Fact and fiction mix.
I'm sure my own world of value will pass on to the show.
I don't think relationships are bad, but I don't think relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
A lot of people learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the self-discoverer is drawing a current picture of young adults living in Finland at 100 years of age.
According to him, many have learned much about relationships with their parents, many of whom have been divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance is performed by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes dresser Ella Snellman.
Music is made up of Jappinen and Rokka.
Love for the theater was lit in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, studies as a director of the theatre-expression at the Academy of Arts of Turku University of Applied Sciences.
There's two years in the back, and there's another one in the front.
Jäppinen's enthusiasm for the theatre has started during the Kouvolan years.
The school of music classes has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has played at the Yliopisto Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the Linna Theatre in Turku.
Control has become more and more interesting.
The self-discoverer got his premiere last week at the Narrin stage in Helsinki.
A performance lasting about 45 minutes has also been seen in the future at least in Jäppinen's studying city in Turku.
Self-discoverer in Kouvola's What? Theatre 4.8. at 19 and 5.8. at 14 and 19.
The Finnish Olympic winner recovered for a year from a terrible motocrossnettivity - the collar was broken
Few athletes in Finland are the same as Janne Lahtila.
For a period of 20 years, the ace of Kumpares toured the world for hundreds of days, chasing his dream of the gold of the Olympics.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtila movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainee, but also a tester of new species.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on earth that the chemi lake would not have tried at least once.
It's inspired me to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtela says.
Finally, one hobby was to stop the Lahtila completely.
In 2014, Lahtila suffered a motocross accident.
As a result, his collar and both hands were broken.
I wasn't working anywhere.
I licked wounds at my home for a year, Lahtila says.
It was bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a part in the disaster.
Driving a bike might sound crazy.
But I didn't get boundaries on it.
It's just so hard as a species, it's not worth too much time for a 40-year-old like this!
After the accident, Lahtila was faced with a particular situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
Behind was a long start as the main coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtila started in the pest immediately after the end of his career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela tells me.
Even during the training period, Lahtela often challenged her protector in the slope and in the physical tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that even my own thoughts did not seem reasonable.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be in place.
I actually enjoy it because I actually had to be for once.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtila to become the main coach in Finland.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'll be burned to death.
It's easier to find places that are broken than whole!
If it wasn't for the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as a coach for the Finnish freestyle country team about a year ago.
About the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace the speedmakers.
I switched the motocrosses to frisbeegolf!
I mean, it just got out of hand right now.
I was at my worst seven hours a day tossing.
Although Lahtila himself has always been a super-intelligent trainer, he does not require that he be trained to be like him.
I don't force everyone into the same fashion.
There is room in our species culture to be different and ways to be the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been according to it, Lahtila says.
The sex robots are coming and we need to be concerned.
It is here: a report on the development of technology in the sex robotics sector – just when it began to feel that 2017 could no longer be more strange.
Oh, yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robotics within the next 5-10 years.
"We must begin to take the generalisation of sex robots seriously," says the founding member of the Foundation and Professor Emeritus Noel Sharpey Sheffield, professor of robotics and artificial intelligence.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of nipples and the type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are being skided, but they are already sold quite a lot, and we will see more of them," Sharkey said at the release of the report.
Sex locks have evolved from blowing dolls to robots with a warm silicone skin and artificial intelligence-like characteristics.
The user can also adapt the robot to his own preferences from the colour of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and color of the fingertips.
All the more worrying is that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford's women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex locks have developed into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix’s features can be adapted to the user’s preferences, such as shyness.
True Companion Roxxx Gold robots have a preprogrammed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality is adapted as fully as possible to the user's personality", the company's website is advertised.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be, like, tired, with talk wind or "in the mood".
There are many worrying features of the generalisation of sex robots, which replace genuine relationships, but even more dangerous are the subjugation of women and direct rape fantasies when the user approaches, for example, shy and resistant to programmed robots.
True Companion compares Roxxxy with the vibrator on its website:
"Women have vibrators, why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
Sex robots, however, are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalisation and development is about something darker and deeper in our culture: the decline in gender equality towards sexual interaction, where subjugation is one of the alternatives among others.
Of course, most men do not have sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
But the marginal phenomena tell us a lot about the spirit of time.
And many begin to behave strangely or offensively only when the market authorises it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have begun to become widespread at the same time as women's rights are threatened around the world and the White House is sitting in a president who has been bragging about the harassment of women.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale (Your Ladyship) is not the most worrying image language of the film, such as images of hanged bodies and excavated eyes. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short distance.
Sex robots are being tried to make as many real women as technically possible (by porn star proportions).
Robot developers want their skin to feel genuine and movements to imitate human movements as well as possible.
But their "personalities" are far from reality.
A robot can't get out of a relationship or a situation.
They do not have their own will or history — nothing that indicates independence or that violates the fantasy of perfect submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slavery.
The police suspect that two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, led by Chief Isis.
The head of Isis, a group of Australian men, is suspected of carrying a bomb onto a plane of Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, Isis had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
The suspect was that the bomb was intended to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company interrupted before the security check.
The police won't tell me exactly why the company stopped.
The second plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device that separates toxic non-coloured gas and to bring the device to a full public place, such as public transport.
Australian Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Because of suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations continue.
The good side of the Trump?
Make Mitt Romney look like a common sense.
During the Trump period, it has already been repeated that a strong divide of voters has also broken up families on a daily basis.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the American newspaper advisory boards showed how Trumpi’s family members were dealt with.
We all want to blow our information bubble.
Trump's ability to unite families has been neglected.
I'm telling you about this because my cousin was visiting me this week in New York, who is a left-wing poet in Chicago who's been on the other side of our family with the Republicans for a long time.
He recalled that a common enemy can have a powerful combined effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all my cousins – including the Republican-friendly sibling with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades – are suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but, more generally, there are significant risks involved.
Trump has given the left a new stream, but the distortive effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we talk about the scary possibility that one day we won't be able to scare his tricks anymore.
In the long term, there is even more terrible possibility that Trump will normalise the right edge of the Republicans, which suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
I think of Mitt Romney's restrained version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (and at least we've seen his tax returns).
Once Trump's season is over, the Republican next presidential candidate has to be clear-cut, and it immediately feels like a considerable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our kids to Central Park's carousel, which is the biggest carousel in New York Park, and the best thing you can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
The Carousel horses are huge, the characters in the middle — the crafty clowns and the animals that look back in terror — and the screaming music behind them is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York’s features are becoming disappointed over time: the view of the tall buildings is getting tired, the city’s silhouette becomes too familiar and the city’s reality is not in line with dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I have not completely overcome the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cabin, but a large traffic circle in northern London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-spirited pub, but it is not counted.
On the other hand, the carousel of Central Park is still a strangely magical experience — even to the extent that two two - year - olds, one - ageds, and two forty - five - year - olds enjoyed it enormously.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately, no one came to ask.
Instead, this week I was asked to evaluate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card in a reading device.
It's the same thing at my coffee shop on the corner of my house, but there I'll also be given the opportunity to combine the 15% service money with the estimate when I go to the coffee counter myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer server to put their person in the game when it is not needed.
The merchant at the mall smiled with regret when I tiredly gave five stars to my credit card experience.
Shefki Kuqi got fired from Inter, "There was no trust in the leadership."
The FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuq from the mission team's coach's duties.
The coaching responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Piccareta, who previously served as an assistant coach.
Other training groups will continue in their current roles.
Italy’s Piccareta has previously been an assistant coach in, among other things, English Sunderland.
In January, Piccareta, 51 years old, joined Inter’s training group, has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Mr Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the FC Inter Board, regretted what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant assignment.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the company's management, when there was no other option, Håkans commented in the company's press release.
The Piccareta Agreement shall be in force until the end of the period.
He and the other training team are already responsible for the home match against HIFK tomorrow.
According to the information of the evening-Sanomas, the team has been on the same day on Thursday.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that assistant coach Piccareta and John Allen have been deported.
Kuqi and Piccareta got together in the Inter match against PS Kem last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth picture in the '80s. Would you recognize a serious violin student?
The violinist Linda Lampenius published a youth picture in Instagram.
A number of puzzles have been added to the picture, which suggests that the musician is 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student in the picture.
Lampenius himself wonders seriously about the young woman watching the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he's texting.
If you don't see the picture, you can take a look at it here.
Lampenius has already published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
A fair year ago, he published a picture of himself in Instagram.
In the second picture he was seen 20 years ago, in the second picture he poses now, as a mother of two children.
In his illustration, Lampenius meditates on his own growth as a person and refers to eating disorders that he suffered when he was younger.
Just 20 years ago and today...
I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added in English Hashtags to life, eating disorder, uncertainty, confidence, self-esteem, love for himself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has been openly speaking about his past years of eating.
He was already 14 years old in the hospital because of anorexia and orthoesthesia.
A little later, he also became ill with his bulimia, which was eventually revealed only in 2006.
Healing started slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer review, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was sent from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for cuts on his wrists, which according to the prison authorities he fell in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after the prosecution's original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp's Valentine's Day in his early hours in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a night-time intruder hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have stated that they intend to appeal again because they consider the six - year sentence of Pistorius to be too mild.
The Kingdom Prosecutor intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may already be dealt with this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the judgment of Pistorius may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs according to the BTV channel.
The police arrested a number of unauthorized campers in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, where there were two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released on the same day, but the case continues.
According to the television channel bTV, the Foreign Ministry later announced that they had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping areas and already impose significant fines on all those camped in areas other than those reserved for purpose.
The checks shall continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced that the right to fine may be imposed.
Liquid share sinks - already down -7.7%
Oil refiner Liquid shares have fallen by 7.7% around 11 a.m.
Its result before taxes decreased, but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financialal.
The stock exchange store has started today on a slightly cold side, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
After the opening of the stock exchanges, the large European Stoxx 600 index had gone up by 0.2%.
The Helsinki Stock Exchange General Index OMXH had decreased by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points after about half an hour of trading and the most swapped companies OMXH25 had gone up by 0.3 per cent.
The total exchange on the stock exchange was EUR 41 million, of which 9 million was the morning's profit and loss release.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares of the digestive system.
However, the recent study claims the opposite: a diet containing a high level of meat protein and dairy products may help to relieve the irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in Great Britain, causing stomach cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People with irritable bowel syndrome are generally advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan in the protein helps the body to develop immune cells that strengthen the intestinal tolerance.
According to research director Marco Colonna, immune cells guard the intestine and ensure that the harmful microbes do not hide in the food.
Inflammatory cells are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance, which protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, it may result in irritable bowel syndrome.
Studies have shown that immunocells that enhance tolerance are present in mice with a specific intestinal bacteria.
This bacteria requires tryptophan to produce immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
"We found a link between the development of Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuter is part of normal intestinal microbiome," says Professor Colonna.
"The more tryptophan was in the mouse's diet, the more they had these immune cells."
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a high level of tryptophan-containing diet may enhance the intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammability.
When studying immunocells to enhance tolerance, researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they did not exist in mice of the same species that were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to microbiomes in the intestinal tract of mice, or the normal gastrointestinal bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the community.
When the intestinal DNA of mice was tested, six species of bacteria were detected in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were administered to mice in a sterile environment that had no intestinal microbiome and did not develop immune cells, immune cells began to develop.
Researchers wanted to find out how the bacteria affect the immune system. They raised Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the fluid and transferred small amounts of fluid — without bacteria — from mice to immature immune cells.
The immune cells developed into tolerant cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When the number of tryptophans was doubled in mice, the number of cells that boosted tolerance increased by approximately 50 %. When the number of tryptophans was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the time before.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, a person has the same tolerance-enhancing cells as a mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products from the Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria can develop cells in humans in the same way as in mice. However, gene defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells, because they regulate inflammation on the inside of the intestines," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"High levels of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuteri may contribute to their generalisation."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got a "neron" after he made a deal with Nemanja Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a "neron" after he made a deal with Nemanja Matic. The middle-field player debuted Manchester United in a row fight against Sampdor on Wednesday night.
In the last round of the UEFA Super Cup tournament in Dublin, Math, who moved from Chelsea at £40 million, began a 2-1 victory against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira on Tuesday.
But Matic was not in the best condition yet, because he was not on the Asian tour of the blue shirts before the beginning of the season. He did only 45 minutes in the field – according to Mourinho, there must be a change before the beginning of the valoliika period.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his way of thinking make him a genius – he has the natural ability to think football," says Mourinho.
"We'll help him be ready rather than later."
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho began to cut his start-up formation for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a "bright job" by acquiring three of his four priority players.
"3 out of four – we must thank the Society for that," he added.
"I'd be happier if I got all four of them, but they did an excellent job."
Balloon women teased Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women’s volleyball country team lost its fourth World Cup match directly to Germany 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German routine level of gambling is high.
Their game was equal in every sector, the Finnish head coach Tapio Kangasniemi explained in the release.
In the first two periods, Finland kept its opponent busy, but in the third period Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and aggressively in certain places, we were able to play along," Kangasniemi said.
The most effective Finland had gained 14 points of Pia Korhonen.
Three out of four lost Finland will meet Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: The Grand Jury has already sent challenges in connection with the Trump Jr meeting in Russia
In the United States, the great jury has sent challenges to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The great jury convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr and a Russian lawyer known as Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The news agency Reuters, which at the same time confirms the information previously revealed by the Wall Street Journal about the gathering of a large jury on Thursday.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Trump Jr and Veselnitskaya, known for the Kremlin connections, which was held in June 2016 at the U.S. presidential elections.
Paul Manafort, then campaign manager of Donald Trump Sr, as well as his son-in-law Jared Kushner, current advisor to the White House, were also present.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a large jury in Washington means that the pace of Russian investigation is tightened up.
Sources add that Mueller wanted to help the great jury to investigate Russia's involvement in the US presidential elections and whether Trump's campaign or his family cooperated with Russia.
The great jury will extend Mueller's rights to gather evidence, send challenges, and force people to testify.
The great jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury is weighing evidence from the prosecutor's investigation and deciding whether to bring charges.
A British inventor microcirculated himself to get into his home and car by waving his hand
The British inventor is the first in the whole country to microcircle himself so that he can open the door to his home, get to his office and start his car with a shake of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and the front finger of a 33-year-old Steven Northam. Now he offers a service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam’s BioTeq technology.
Northam cooperates with Geoff Watson, a consultant at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital at Winchester, Hans, in order to meet the medical requirements of the microchip installation.
The microchip uses the same technique as the microchips of cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds to install it.
Northam’s attempt also makes the locks of houses and cars compatible with the microchip. The handling of one lock costs £300.
Northam is married and has one child. He has placed microchip technology both in his home and BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hands on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibition cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's last decision to fly the Navy helicopter to the southern lawn of the White House for the American production event came to pay the taxpayers $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D Helicopter is called Marine One when the President is on board. It was the attraction of the event held in the White House on 17 July 2017 where American construction programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a bunch of White House officials were familiar with the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, the samples included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office had requested a helicopter's presence by mission-specific order only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn for an "exceptional" event. This is shown in the documents of the Navy's HMX-1 helicopter fleet.
"I just wanted to make sure that you're aware of this because this is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 unit commander wrote in an e-mail to his superior on the day before the event, who is Deputy Commander of the Navy Air Force.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive on the southern lawn at the 17th of July at seven o’clock in the morning and the event would start at three o’clock. The helicopter would not leave the site until the field was cleared between six and nine o’clock.
In addition, the message mentioned that if the departure of the helicopter from the White House was delayed, another crew would be required due to the limitations on duty hours.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security staff was at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by the TIME magazine whether another crew was eventually needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state assets for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked if the event was a violation of the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act.
"It sounds like you can participate," the deputy commander replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political shades.
At that time, the President spoke in favour of the health reform that was being dealt with by the Senate and of a looser state regulation.
The use of Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their journeys,
but their use for photographs is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of the president's campaign in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor's presidential plane on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which presented products made from American materials from all 50 states," said Lindsay Walters, Press Secretary of the White House.
The HMX-1 unit crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train on the southern lawn to bring the president to the White House with centimeters of accuracy.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 landings for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of the monthly training quota for the crew.
On that day, the unit's helicopters also flew 11 hours in non-presidential support.
According to the White House, no other costs were incurred by the taxpayers.
Sikorsky’s informant reported that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter presentation in the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have records of operations related to the duties of the President and it is difficult to accurately assess the costs of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence’s hourly compensation for the VH-3D helicopter in 2017, the level of compensation is USD 24 380 per flight hour.
According to the HMX-1 unit, flights from the Quantico base to the White House from the state of Virginia took a total of one hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are clearly lower.
"The calculation of the costs to be incurred by the payees according to the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation shall include staff, maintenance and many other so-called immersion costs, which shall be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a survey carried out by the RAND research company in 2015, the levels of compensation do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, Sean Spicer, former Press Secretary of the White House, defended the use of the helicopter in the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and thus employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of helicopters and other defences for which many Americans have worked hard.
It is perfectly appropriate to bring it up."
It's not certain if Trump was in the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat in the driver's seat.
In the White House, Trump was joking to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president. "I have three."
The lightning hit the train on the train to the train to replace the trains by buses.
The passenger rail transport between the Wall River and measurea is disrupted due to technical failure, states the Railway Transport Centre.
For the time being, trains are replaced by buses.
The traffic control system malfunction was caused by thunder.
In the morning, the Centre did not have an estimate of the duration of the repair.
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor requests the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor has applied for a court decision which would prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
The President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that the elected representative of last Sunday's vote is due to be appointed on Friday.
In the controversial vote, a representative was elected to the country, which could, among other things, change its constitution.
According to Attorney General Luisa Ortega, the request for an arrest warrant has been made for suspicions of malpractice.
Ortega has also started an electoral fraud investigation from the vote.
He appointed two judges after the British company that held the parliamentary vote stated that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of real voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated for the representation, and the elected 545-member representatives include, among other things, Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, the Congress, led by the opposition, can break down and change the laws.
Maduroa described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the Constitution as a means of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called it a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, for their part, have declared that they do not recognise a new representative.
Maduro claims that the new delegation is a solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, unrest has continued for months.
They've wounded a lot of people and over a hundred have died.
Venezuela fell into an economic crisis after oil prices fell.
Now many people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to express its opinion on Friday, when the new representative body is due to begin.
A Russian man delivered by Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, the Minneapolis Court sentenced the 41-year-old Maxim Senah to almost four years in prison for his involvement in global computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a request from the United States.
According to the Russian magazine Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland handed Senah over to the US judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian objections, says AFP.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after the execution of the prison sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly criticised Finland after the arrest and said that a man should not be extradited to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were accused that the arrest was made in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the D.A., Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury that infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for usernames and passwords.
The fraudsters then used the data by further directing the Internet traffic, which allowed click fraud and spam to be distributed.
According to the Director Kenneth Blanco of the Ministry of Justice, the case shows that the United States is also capable of hunting other cyber criminals.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco said in the press release.
Adjusted at 20.58: Adjusted for the customization of the name of the sentenced person.
Narcos's third production season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so the Cali cartel will go to the top of Netflix's hit series.
Even though Pablo Escobar's killer was exposed during the second production of Narcos, the Netflix series is definitely not over.
The reproducing service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons of production are seen from the series. The third season trailer has been published and presents the new frogs in the series.
During the third production period, the DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world's richest drug trading organization.
The organization run by four godfathers is a "like Fortune 500", except that the corruption and violence of the authorities is a little more.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) runs the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages the connections to Mexico, and Cheve Santa Cruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a recently announced trailer, Pedro Pascal is returning to Javier Peñana, recruiting American and Colombian policemen for the war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third production period of Narcos begins on 1 September.
Kari Kola carries out an exceptional work of light art in Paris
Joensuu's lighting artist Kari Kola (in the statue) will carry out an exceptional work of light work in honor of the first Day of Light set by the United Nations in Paris next May 16.
Kola is doing a work of light art in Paris called Day and Night.
The theme of the book is light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the Fontenoy building of UNESCO headquarters and the Globe monument on its behalf.
In my book, I want to highlight not only the light but also the darkness.
Today, light pollution in millions of cities is a major problem affecting the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make the things I have experienced concretely visible," says lighting artist Kari Kola.
I am well invited to attend the first international light day and bring the art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola attended the opening of the The The Year of Light in 2015, when she lit the Unesco headquarters for the occasion of the festival.
I feel very privileged to re-enact my art at UNESCO headquarters, Kari Kola says.
The work may still be significantly enlarged.
This will be announced later in the autumn, Kola continues.
The aim of International Light Day is to highlight the importance of light for mankind and to raise people's awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on 16 May.
Two men fighting in the mall parking garage in Espoo
Two men had a fight in Espoo at the shopping center in the parking garage of Great Apple on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute arose when the other party accidentally drove into a prohibited driving direction.
There was an oral dispute between drivers.
The driver who drove in the forbidden direction rushed the driver of another car, and as a result he started to run into the hitter's car.
After that, he hit the hood of a hit car.
In a preliminary talk, the man has admitted that he has caused injury and has done wrong.
The article entitled Timo Soin's question mark: "After that came the Flood"
On Thursday, Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini published a blog titled with a question mark.
The article is short, only two sentences.
In my time, the party grew from zero to a government party of thirty-seven representatives.
Then there came a flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
The text of Soin contains references to France in the 17th century.
The King Ludvig XV or this mistress, Madame de Pompadour, is known to have used a flood comparison.
Depending on our interpretation, history's books have been marked by "the flood after us" or "the flood after me".
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
The elections are only representative if they allow all members of society, including women, to vote, said the head of the UN delegation in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
The provisional head of the UN Assistance Mission, Nicholas Haysom, stated that hundreds of women are nominated for the elections to the county councils, three women are working as Vice-President and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasised," said Haysom in his opinion on Wednesday.
The elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all aspects of the electoral process.
The regional council and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has made threats to the elections at the same time as international forces are moving to a consultative role.
This year's elections will be the first time that power has been transferred from a peaceful democratically elected government to one another.
Mr Haysom said that women's contribution would strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the independent démarches committee in Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

It's a clearer night and a brighter night.
In the south and the middle part of the country, the weather is high; in the south, it can also occur from the thunder.
In the south of the evening, there is a southwest seat and a clearer one, a certain rainfall may still come.
The afternoon temperature is about 15 in the rain, after the end of a more uniform rain on the southwest coast, close to 20 degrees.
In the north, cloudiness varies and comes local afternoon courses.
During Friday and Saturday, the low pressure is controlled by weather conditions in the south and central parts of the country, and the rains are common.
In the north, the rains are low.
On Saturday, in the southern and central parts of the country, it is raining in many places, including thunder.
Rains also extend to part of Kainuu.
In the north, cloudiness is abundant in the afternoon and individual rainfalls become.
On the south coast, there is wind from the south; in the middle and north of the country, the air flow is east-east.

The flood of certain tourists threatens the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it 'eat and flee' tourism: only a few hours are at stake and large crowds are rushing through the sights.
Venice is suppressed by rapid day trips to the city.
It is difficult to move on narrow streets and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the people of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move ever further away from the historical center, while hotels have replaced homes.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
The authorities will consider limiting the number of tourists.
They call the present phenomenon low quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, time is given for two or three hours.
You follow the guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialton Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and turn back, describes the current and problematic tourism of the Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the site, shops and workshops.
We need to maintain this part of the city's identity.
St. Mark’s Square is also one of the most popular tourist destinations of the historic centre in Venice.
The church of St. Markus is located on the side of the market.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
There are only 50,000 locals living in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951 there were some 175 000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians expressed their opinion against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has undermined their quality of life, destroy the environment, and drive away the inhabitants.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years' time, there will be no tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says the demonstration organised by Carlo Belframe.
The equation is difficult because ships bring the income they desperately need to Venice and create the need for a number of jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it is envisaged that cruisers go further away from the historical center.
In the view of Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the administrative area of Veneto, where Venice is also located, had more power to decide on its own matters - if not full autonomy.
Some 20-30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
Bad kilometres of traffic along the motorway
On the freeway to the north between Kuopio and Lake Siilinjärvi, traffic congestion has been several miles from Thursday afternoon’s work during the return journey.
In the area, road coating works are carried out, which slows down traffic, says Savo Sanomat.
In the case of roads, there is a 50 km per hour limit instead of the usual 120 km per hour limit.
In the 50 km restricted area, however, transport had progressed in practice in Thursday afternoon.
On Thursday afternoon, the road work continued on the side of Lake Siilin, near the statue of Revelation, or golden deer.
I get along well without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published wonderful pictures of herself in the Grand Canyon scenery, among other things.
The Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in Norway in its present home country, not least because he broke a record of 26-year-old Norway in a 400-metre run around the track in March 51.81.
A month later, he cured the 400 - metre fence run at the time of the Norwegian record of 55.38.
After his record, Iuel, who used social media hard, was able to see that fame and publicity had their shadows.
Apparently, men around the world began sending Iuel pictures of their sexual organs in the hope that a young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account from outside.
I got a lot of "scrambles" from people I don't know, so I was forced to turn my account into private, and Iuel told VG magazine.
In his interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of pictures he received.
I'm sure you can guess, Iuel was laughing.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I'm getting along very well without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when he was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, her family moved to Namibia first for her father's work, then Pakistan.
After that, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were in charge.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he exchanged Danish citizenship with Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is training under the guidance of three coachs, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to debate than the United States.
In the United States, trainers do not ask anything, they only give instructions.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal with the athlete in person, said Iuel to VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records at 400 metres and at 400 meters of fence.
The more the snowboarder, Janne Korve, took the whole career to the balance line - now he's in the World Cup: "It's nice not to hurt anything"
It's been nice counting now that it hasn't hurt!
Janne Korpi, 31, among the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has been able to enjoy its beloved species again this season.
Last summer, the career extension was at stake.
The pain of the foot table had forced Korve to operate on the operating table in January, and the leg did not want to get any better.
The hand too had hit the competition.
In the summer, I didn't know what I was gonna do, whether or not I'm gonna go on with the ferrying.
The sponsors were broken, and a lot of things were open," Vorpi says.
But that's what they say. It's the way things work out.
The leg improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood started to draw back on the slope.
It was then easy to decide further.
I knew it at the latest when I first went snow.
I was like, "Damn it, this is so much fun, let's just pull over a couple more times."
It was not until September-October, but after a long billing break, training was a big deal.
The Korpi has only been around a few.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of skating for Korvel.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to spend four years in one race, and then you're going to get a fever that week.
I'm tired of thinking that, Vorpi says.
Today Korpi will race in the halfpipe of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Although the individual races do not keep him on board, in hard company he always starts to compete.
According to the basket, the appreciation of the competitions organised by the International Ski Union has increased in recent years, although some of the skaters chose the Norwegian X-Games at the same time.
Yes, this is an important race, the visibility is high.
However, I believe that appreciation always depends on the conditions and level of the games.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in the 12-person Finnish team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's holes, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekankas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to watch younger guys go.
I remember when I was at the same time that everything was new and so sickly excited about everything.
It's bringing itself a new power, Korpi's thinking.
I'm still on the front somehow, but otherwise I'm not, there's enough power in the guys!
In the background of the boarding career Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of the pilot legend Pekka Korve has become involved in health sports: the skateboarder has his own horses for which he is doing training programs.
When I'm on a trip all the time, there's no more time for it to be in the messee.
But every day I look at at at least the dietary results and usually some departures," Vorpi says.
According to Korve, therapeutic guidance and training are a potential career plan when the boarding career comes to an end.
I don't think I'm planning that far, but at least it's a likely option.
I feel like I'm a little bit of a student here, along with snowboarding.
I'm just trying to stay calm for a while and develop, maybe in the summer I'll drive some kind of departures.
If it is my future profession, it will not be difficult to start when you are already inside the species.
It also includes the Elitloppet therapeutic cruise with host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship, which will be heading towards the Elitloppet therapeutic competition in Stockholm at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to reinvigorate the old tradition.
The cruise has gone well into business, and people have been very excited.
We're already at the point where there's not going to be bankruptcy.
There's still a few months left, let's hope we can get the ship loaded, the Vorpi says he's excited.
Attendo's nursing home project for Kite has surprised everyone.
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new nursing home for 41-seat elderly people built for Kite.
The building of more than 1,700 floor-based living quarters is expected to be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre’s neighbor Healthway.
The general topic of wonder is where the new care unit is equipped with customers, because now, during Siu's war, many private nursing homes are suffering from a shortage of customers.
Anne Flink Attendo, Regional Manager of Care Services, commented that Kite will have more demand in the future not only for options but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice also works better, says Flink.
Attendo bought private nursing homes in Kite last year in Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The deal concerned business, but the property is known to have a five-year lease.
Flink says that Attendo does not have an acute need to move operations away from these facilities.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand in Scotland.
The trade union is seeking confirmation from the leaders of McVitie's inventor for a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the GMB Scottish section of the British General Trade Union, the company has not reported on its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
There are over 500 employees at the Hobnobs and Rich Tea factory.
The company that owns the McVitie's brand, Pladis, reported that it has invested over £5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives will be "the first to be informed" if changes are to be made.
In its letter to the manager, GMB calls on the company to "responsible for the lack of funding for the modernisation of production lines".
Drew Duffy, the GMB Trade Union, is very concerned about the lack of clear knowledge of the needs of the Tollcross business and the future investment plans.
"Family families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has been strongly focused on the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area. The factory is a significant employer in the area of high unemployment and low income.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and income and the constant reduction of Brexit's living costs and production, East Glasgow urgently needs successful McVitie's production."
According to Pladis, the factory manager had only received a letter from the trade union the previous day and the company answered the letter directly because it appreciates the continuous interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of issues openly.
We discussed with the workers, among other things, that, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we would continuously evaluate all our business activities and offices in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the notifier, in recent years the company has invested more than GBP 5 million in the Tollcross factory, in particular its production lines and the improvement of its operations.
"We are aware of the long history of the Tollcross as a production facility and will certainly be the first to inform employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the operation of the factory."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about the transfer of Neymar three years ago?
LaLiga may regret her interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain is not going to give up Neymar's goal after he paid £ 189 million to close the transfer agreement, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record of transfer sums. The previous record was less than half: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer amount of GBP 89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive footballer in the world and also the best hired professional athlete in the world, as PSG will offer him over £500 000 a week after taxes.
The source near Barcelona tells us that the club has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of the PSG warn the football world about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif warned the best players in PSG.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they want our players, we'll be their opponent and we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they want our players, they'll have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of this: it expressed interest in the PSG’s midfield player Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances, and it might well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar.

Now, the calls Trump inspired were invented by the White House informant: "I wouldn't say it was a lie."
The White House admits that the two calls mentioned by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, never happened, reports the New York Times.
The calls that Trump smoked with both the Mexican President and the Head of the Scouts’ Association have proved to be ingenious.
The White House informant Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had taken place.
But he said Trump didn't lie.
According to Sanders, many of the patrol leaders spoke to Trump in person, and Trump had discussed with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the Hamburg G20 meeting.
I wouldn't say it was a lie. It's a pretty serious accusation.
Those conversations took place, not just on the phone, but on the face, Sanders justified.
Talking to Scouts Arouses Disgruntling
On Monday, Trump told me that the Mexican president called him and said that Trump had succeeded in overcoming illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told us that few people are coming across the southern border of Mexico anymore because they know that they're going to go to the U.S. border anyway.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government published a release saying that the call had not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico published a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
That's where Trump heated up his speech at a major meeting of the National Scouts' Association in West Virginia.
I got a call from the head of the scouts, and he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, a patrol organization informed us that it was not aware of any of its executives' calls to Trump.
According to the press, the previous statement by the director of the organization, Michael Surbaugh, in which he had asked Trump to apologize to the scouts, speaks for himself.
The speech by Mr Trump at the meeting of the Scouts' Association caused a lot of confusion, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he inspired the results of the presidential elections last autumn.
