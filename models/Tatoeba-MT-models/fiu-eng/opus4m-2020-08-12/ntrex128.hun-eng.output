Members of the Wales National Assembly are afraid to find themselves at the Muppet Show
Some of the members of the National Assembly were shocked by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The alarm arose after the National Assembly (Assembly) was called the Welsh Parliament.
Now, Members of Parliament from various political backgrounds are all afraid that the new title could make them a laughing stock.
According to one Labour Member, his political group is concerned that their new name will rhyme with the words “Twp” and “Pwp”.
Not for the sake of our Welsh readers: in the Welsh language, twp is one-off, and pwp is a poop.
According to one representative of the Plaid Party, the entire group is "unsatisfying" and therefore proposes alternatives.
One conservative Member said that his group was "open" to change names, however, he noted that MWP was only one jump from "Muppet".
Here it is worth noting that in Welsh the letter ‘w’ is written in the same way as in Yorkshire, in English, the word ‘u’, i.e. ‘map’.
The position of the National Assembly Committee responsible for drawing up the draft law introducing change of name is as follows: "The final decision on the titles for the names of the members of the National Assembly is, of course, in the hands of the Members."
The law of 2017 governing the governance of Wales allowed the National Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation which proposed to include the name of the Welsh Parliament and which received broad support.
With regard to the title of Members, the Commission prefers the title of the Welsh Parliament Member (representative of the Wales Parliament) and the abbreviation of its WMP, but the public consultation supported the alternative MWP.
Members come up with new and new alternatives, but the agreement is rather difficult, which is a problem for the president of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who will have to submit a bill on change of name in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly on other points, including the disqualification of Members and the Commission structures.
Members will be able to cast their final votes on their own address during the debate on the draft law.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing the name of the country
Citizens will vote on Sunday whether the country's name will be changed to the "Night Macedonian Republic".
The aim of the referendum is to put an end to a decades-long debate with neighbouring Greece, one of which is also called Macedonia.
For a long time, Athens has stated that, with the name of its northern neighbour, it is essentially a territorial demand and has repeatedly challenged its request for EU and NATO admission.
President Gjorge Ivanov himself opposes the referendum on change of name and thus does not take part in it.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that change of name is simply a compromise that they must make for their accession to the EU and NATO.
The Harlem temples are in a difficult situation, the bells of St. Martin have also been silenced.
“As I hear from the elders, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
"Today he's not one of them."
As you say, the disappearance of the bars would be understandable.
“ People are dating other people these days, ” he says.
– Bars are no longer the community daytimes where people end up every day."
As far as the churches are concerned, Adams is afraid that the sale of church property will not replace the hopes of the leaders, “and they will be held again in the same place as they left.”
The churches will be replaced by residential buildings whose community also does not help the fate of the remaining churches.
“The vast majority of people buying housing in these buildings will be white-skinned,” he says, and this will continue to rush the final closure of the churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those moving into these apartments would join the faith community.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black city – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out of the church in the late 30s,
which was then taken over by a nearby black congregation.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by the black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson – the Reverend is known to lead the Harlem shopping street, 125th street to use blacks or the boycott against business owners who refuse to sell black products.
In 1939 a fire caused serious damage to the building, but during the renovation the bell was built to order a community led by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, and his successor at the St. Martin parish, proudly referred to the bells of the poor.
In July, an expert who spoke to the bell game said that this bell was a "cultural heritage", a "unreplaceable instrument of historical importance".
The University of Michigan expert, Tiffany Ng, also noted that this was the world's first game of bell played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was in the middle of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin didn't sign anyone.
In St. Martin, a difficult situation has arisen in recent months with the participation of architects and entrepreneurs who have been partly involved by the secular leadership of the church, partly by the bishop’s office.
In July, the Governing Body of the Parochia, the Council of the Church, addressed to the Bishop's Office in writing, objecting to the Office's "transfer of costs" to the Council, when the Council did not participate in the selection of architects and contractors appointed by the Office.
Some members of the congregation complain about lack of transparency around the office’s house.
Shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California while fishing for crabs
According to official reports, a shark attacked and injured a 13 - year - old boy fishing on the opening day of the shrimp season in California on Saturday.
The attack took place before 7:00 a.m. on the Beacon's Beach coast in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel, on the KSWB TV channel in San Diego, said that he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when a boy cried for help.
Hammel first thought the boy was excited because he managed to catch a cancer, but then he realized that he was yelling, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
“ His shoulder was torn apart at his clavicle, ” Hammel classified what he saw when he arrived at the boy.
“I started shouting at everyone to get out of the water, “The shark is in the water,” he added.
The boy was transferred with an air-rescue to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
As Lieutenant Larry Giles told the press, a few weeks earlier, sharks were detected in the area, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Captain Giles also told me that the boy suffered trauma on his upper body.
The authorities closed the coastline between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours at the time of the investigation and for safety reasons.
According to Giles, more than 135 shark species occur in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's would be expanding on the British beauty market.
Sainsbury's expert would like to compete with sales and large-scale pipers with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
As part of the decline in sales of fashion and household articles in the UK beauty care market, which is constantly increasing, the chain is testing larger pipers in 11 shops across the country, and, if successful, they will also appear in new stores from next year.
The strengthening of the piper line is due to attempts by shops to fill the shelf areas previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household articles.
Sainsbury's has said that it will double, i.e. increase its offer to 3000 products, including brand representatives such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, for the first time.
But earlier brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be located in a larger area on brand-based stands such as Boots and similar stores.
The chain of stores also relaunchs the Boutique makeup family, where most products are now vegan – these are now being sought by an increasing number of young customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop is testing its appearance in two Sainsbury's stores, one of which has already opened last week in Croydon, South London, while the other will open in the Birmingham Selly Oak.
With the spread of online purchases and the shifting of food shopping practices to small local shops, large stores need to make greater efforts to attract consumers.
According to Sainsbury's CEO, Mike Coupe, supply will be more and more similar to mixed shops, as the chain tries to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and other products than food.
Since the two chains were purchased two years ago, the Sainsbury's has opened up the Argos classes and some Habitat classes in hundreds of stores – this step has also had a positive impact on food sales, so the acquisition is even more profitable.
The chain of stores has failed its previous attempt to sew up beauty care and pharmaceutical classes.
Sainsbury's started a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the debate on the distribution of the revenue of the pharmaceutical classes in its stores ended this.
The new strategy was born after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmaceutical business to Celesio, operating the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain three years ago.
According to the chain, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy and will offer a wider range of luxury leather care products in four shops, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As said Sainsbury's Trade Director, Paul Mills-Hicks: “By converting the appearance of our pipers, we want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers.
In addition, we have recruited skilled staff to assist interested parties with advice.
Our brand serves all the needs, and the attractive environment and the conveniently accessible location provide a seductive force that brings your shopping experience to a new level."
Peter Jones "repressed" after Holly Willoughby resigned from the 11 million-pound deal.
The Dragons ’ Den Star, Peter Jones, has left in a “ruttling” way after Holly Willoughby’s television broadcaster has resigned from 11 million important agreements on the retailer’s business of lifestyle products to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the Truly brand, which sells home clothes and accessories.
The two famous companies were previously compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning's 37-year-old showman announced on Instagram that he'd quit.
Holly Willoughby pulled the match thoroughly at Dragons ’ Den’s Star, Peter Jones, when he got out of their promising business of selling lifestyle products at the last minute – to focus on his very profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones “roared” when his television welcome on Tuesday, at the office of Jones’s business empire in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), announced during an intense meeting that, due to its new contracts worth a total of £1.5 million, there was not enough time left for their common brand of home wear and accessories to be dedicated to Truly.
The company of the two celebrities was previously compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and would have doubled Willoughby’s estimated assets to GBP 11 million.
While 37 - year - old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would leave Truly, Jones traveled from island country to a holiday home.
According to one source, “Truly was far from the most important thing for Holly.
It was supposed to deal with this in the long term, and this will give you a living in the next few decades.
Being out was a complete surprise for everyone.
He surprised everyone about what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to leaving.
At the office in Marlow, the warehouse is full of goods waiting for sale."
According to the experts, the departure of one of the most profitable stars in Great Britain from this Morning can cost millions of dollars from pillows and candles to a selection of clothing and household clothing and possible slips.
And it could also mean the end of an old friendship.
The three-year-old hostess and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, ten years ago.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones took over the presidency in March.
The two couples are used to vacation together, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production office.
Willoughby will be the product face of M&S and will take over Ant McPartlin's place as the show manager of ITV I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented on what happened last night: "We don't want to comment on [Jones]' business."
"Then we fell in love."
He was joking about what criticism he would receive from the press for his statement, which some might consider to be “unpresident” and for making such a positive statement about the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump allow so much?
– Trump asked me in a funny, "Walwarts" voice.
- I wouldn't let anything happen."
As you have noted, Kim would like to meet for the second time after his first trial in Singapore in June Trump welcomed North Korea's nuclear disarmament as a huge step.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been overtaken.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, Ri Jongho, a representative of North Korea, told the UN General Assembly that, as his country sees, the United States does not provide a "satisfactory response" to the early armaments of North Korea.
Instead, the United States continues to maintain sanctions for the use of pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic than that in a campaign speech.
“Things are great with North Korea,” he said.
– We were supposed to fight them.
Millions of people would've lost there.
But now we have a very good relationship."
As he said, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results – the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he spoke in such an unusual way about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s not hard to act as a president, but there’s not a ten thousand people out there who are trying to get in here in the long run, just about two hundred,” said Trump, pointing to the group ahead.
In Indonesia, there are hundreds of deaths from the tsunami and earthquakes that are on the island.
Even after the earthquake in Lombardy, Indonesia refused to provide assistance to international aid organisations.
Although more than 10 % of the population of Lombok had to be deployed, no disaster at national level has been reported, which would be a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases it was very clearly stated that there was no need for international assistance, so our situation is a little difficult," said Sumbung.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on building a Palaluable Aid Team, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will be able to participate in on-site rescues.
According to Sutopo, the National Disaster Protection Agency's spokesperson, the Indonesian agencies are still carrying out an assessment of the situation in the request to see if international aid organisations need to be involved.
Despite the continuing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared to face the destructive power of nature.
Although tsunamis were built in Aceh province, in other coastal areas this is not common at all.
Although there was a tsunami signal in place, the obvious lack of a tsunami alarm siren system in Pau also contributed to the development of a disaster requiring human life.
Transport between the Indonesian islands can be difficult even at the best time.
In times of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok is on its way to Palau, but at least three more days before it reaches the disaster zone.
President Widodo has placed the development of a worn infrastructure in Indonesia at the heart of his election campaign and has not saved costs for road and rail projects.
However, the Joko Government is now facing budgetary deficits before next year's elections.
In addition, the President has to face the ongoing party tensions in Indonesia, since the majority of Muslims have started to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced because of the riots during which Christian and Muslim gangs fell into one another on the streets with carvings, bows, arrows, and other warts.
Video: Daniel Sturridge in Liverpool is a huge equator against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool at the premiere League in Stamford Bridge, London, with his score in 89 minutes, who did not lose against Chelsea.
The team lost 0-1 when Sturridge received approximately 30 metres of Xherdan Shaqiri from Chelsea’s gate.
First he put the ball on the left, then he started a huge kick in the far corner of the gate.
The shot was high above the 16th and headed to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally reached the net above the seeding Kepa Arrizabalaga.
“I just wanted to get in position, because there is always someone like Shaq who plays the ball forward, so I tried to put myself in a better position,” said Sturridge, answering LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, and I just took her off, and then I didn't think much, and I shot at her."
Chelsea led to 1-0 in the mid-term, after winning the lead with the Belgian star player Eden Hazard's goal in the 25 minutes.
The blues battle cornered Mateo Kovačič, then managed to break into the middle field and run into Liverpool's square.
Kovačič started after a quick injection and got the ball back in the middle field.
Then, by a beautiful handover, he launched Hazard toward the sixteenth.
Homer ran the defense and finally sent the ball to the far corner of Liverpool near Alisson Becker with a left shot.
Liverpool will meet Naples as the next stop of the Champions League team at 3 p.m. on Wednesday in the Naples Stadium San Paolo arena.
Chelsea is playing against Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA European League.
832 victims of the Indonesian tsunami
The number of Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami victims rose to 832, reported by the local disaster protection agency on Sunday.
As a result of the 7.5-thousand earthquakes that took place on Friday and the six-metre-high flood waves that followed, several people were buried in the ruins, reported by the agency's spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The streets of more than 380 thousand souls are covered by the ruins of the fallen buildings.
Police suspected of murder arresting a 32-year-old man on a stabbed woman.
Police have initiated a murder investigation this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, on the body of a woman.
The body of the 44-year-old woman with stabs was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was already arrested for murder.
The police are asking the residents of the area to report to anyone who has seen or died.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but this time I ask everyone who was in Birkenhead near John Street and may have seen or heard something to contact us.
In addition, I would ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us for information relevant to the investigation, if anyone may have recorded anything on board."
The police spokesperson confirmed that the murdered woman was a sheephead resident and was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, her friends arrived at the scene to find out where the body was found in the morning hours.
The investigation is under way, and the police are currently reporting to the victim's relatives.
A cab driver in Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter the building and no one was allowed to leave.
When he found out what happened, he couldn't even speak.
The residents of the building have now been informed that it may take several hours before they can enter the building again.
One police officer told someone that the entire building is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was struggling with her tears.
"That's terrible," he repeated.
At 2:00 in the afternoon, two police microbuses were inside the corporal, and another one was in there.
Within the corona, several police officers were watching the block.
Anyone with any information, please send a message to @MerPolCC, call number 101, or contact the Crimestoppers organization without a name at 0800 555 111, and make a reference to the 247 file of September 30.
The statue of Parliament Cromwell is the latest victim of the history rewriting fever.
The exile of the statue could perhaps be a poetic justice for the destruction of the cultural and religious heritage of England by Cromwell and his fanatic puritan followers at that time with Taliban enthusiasm.
However, according to the Cromwell Society, Crick's proposal is "crazy", a "try to rewrite history".
According to the president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith: “It was essential that the Oliver Cromwell statue before the Westminster Palace became a target during the current discussions on the removal of statues.
During the British Civil War, Cromwell did not order and execute the image destruction.
So maybe another Cromwell would be a victim for the actions of his prodigal Thomas in the preceding century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive Cromwell experience reflects the opinion of the 19th century and commemorates a historical figure that even today has to be celebrated."
In this regard, Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell may be fewer today than at the end of the 19th century, but many consider Parliament to be a protector of external pressure, which was, of course, the monarchy in his case.
Whether this picture is accurate remains the subject of a historical debate.
However, there is no doubt that this conflict in the middle of the 18th century has affected the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person representing one side of this conflict.
And it is worth celebrating and commemorating the achievements of Lord-Protector."
Murderer pig wounded to death by a Chinese master
According to the local press, a pig attacked and wounded a farmer in a market in the southwestern part of China.
His last name, covered only with blood from a man identified as Yuan, was found with a high blood clot next to a pig on the market in the town of Liupanshui, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is about to inject pigs with a vaccine in a breeding farm in Xining City, China, on 30 May 2005.
The man traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, he found his cousin's body and discovered that the door of the neighboring pig was open.
According to him, the giant candida in the pig's mouth was bloody.
According to the report, the expert study found that the 250-pound pig really bit the farmer to death.
“My cousin's legs were bloody, and they were marched apart,” said Guiyang Evening News, a relative mentioned only in his last name, Wu.
Security footage says that Yuan stepped into the pigs' room at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't Yuan's or his cousin's property.
The leader of the market told Evening News that the pig was locked up so that others would stop harming while the police were investigating the clues at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are currently discussing compensation for the death of a man.
Although not often, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on their Massachusetts farm and caused life-threatening injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound - old pig in Wales imposed a farmer on the tractor until the man’s wife managed to alert him.
In 2012, after a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his own pigs, a farmer in Manitoba said in the CBC News show that pigs are generally not prone to attack, but that the taste of blood can become aggressive.
“They are very players.
Like little kids, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt me.
All you have to do is give them respect," he said.
Serious rainfall after Hurricane Rosa in the Southwest United States
Hurricane Rosa is getting weaker as it reaches the colder waters of the north coast of Mexico, according to forecasts.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will continue to cause serious rainfall in the northwest of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa was struck by winds at 140 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. on Sunday morning at 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to be heading north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-air zone is emerging above the Pacific Ocean and heading westward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Lower California on Monday, a tropical storm floods the Southwest of the United States with a heavy tropical mass.
On Monday, the storm can bring a rainfall of up to 25 cm to some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical humidity of meeting the approaching low air pressure masses will cause intense rainfalls in the coming days in the southwest.
Here, the rain of 3-10 cm can cause sudden floods, ruins of orphans, landslides in the desert.
The heavy tropical humidity can also bring an hourly rainfall of between 5 and 8 cm, especially in the southern areas of Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west, a rainfall of between 5 and 10 cm is expected, especially in Arizona.
Sudden floods may also occur, with rapidly decreasing intensity due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
In particular, it is not recommended to walk in the desert during tropical rains.
Due to severe rainfalls, canyons can become booming rivers, and storms are sometimes accompanied by windfalls and dust clouds.
The approaching low-air masses can cause severe rainfall in the southern California coast.
A rain of up to 1.5 cm is possible, which can cause smaller floods full of debris and flat road relationships.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Fragile tropical rainfalls can be reported in Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, then on Monday, during the day and Tuesday, the rain covers wider areas.
The severe rainfall spreads to the four-block region on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense temperature fluctuations in the United States, as Arctic air masses cool, but tropicals will remain rather warm.
At this point, it can cause severe temperature differences at short distances.
An excellent example of this is the situation in the central region of the United States on Sunday.
Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nbraska) as well as St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) have a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees.
In the coming days, it is expected that even the summer heat will be felt again in larger areas.
In the central and eastern regions of the United States, it is expected that it will be warm in the first half of October, and the temperature will be around 25 to 30 degrees from the southern part of the Great Plains to certain parts of the Northwest.
The temperature in New York on Tuesday reaches 25 degrees, which will be about 5 degrees higher than the average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, temperatures in the east of the United States will be very likely to exceed the average temperature until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
A total of more than 20 million viewers on six television channels were interested in the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, who applied for the highest court position and the woman who accused him of sexual violence in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse has not been resolved, and the broadcasters had to interrupt the regular course due to the last-minute round of Fridays: Senator Jeff Flake in Arizona has managed to force the FBI to get a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that he was 100% certain that at a high school party, Kavanaugh would touch him and try to undress him.
In Kavanaugh's passionate testimony, he said that he was 100% certain that this had not happened.
The testimony was probably seen by more than 20.4 million viewers on Friday.
Nielsen calculated the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which transmitted the hearing, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is difficult to measure the number of people who watch shows at work.
For the sake of comparison, so many people watch football finals or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, which was the number of experts supporting the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the highest with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day hearing.
In second place, the ABC stands with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS 3,1, NBC 2,94, MSNBC 2,89, and CNN 2,52 million were watched, according to Nielsen's report.
The interest was not reduced after the hearing.
The main character of the Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
Following the release of the statement by the moderate Republican Senator's office that Senator Kavanaugh would vote for the vote, on Friday morning, the CNN and CBS will be on the show, as a loud crowd of protestors will receive it, as he tries to meet the court-martial committee on the elevator.
He was eyeballed for minutes while the crowd was admiring him, and CNN was broadcasting the scene live.
“Here I stand before you,” said a woman to the senator.
– Do you really think that Kavanaugh is telling the truth to the public in the country?"
Others shouted, “You have the power to do what so many women do not.”
All he said was that his office issued a statement and then added before closing the elevator door that he would share his words with the Commission at the hearing.
The cable and broadcasting channels were then seen live hours later, as the committee voted on whether to extend the candidate for Kavanaugh to the whole Senate.
However, Mr Flake said that he would only be willing to do so if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the candidate next week, as requested by the Democrats in the minority.
Flake's discussions with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, have convinced him of the need to do this.
Flake decided to talk to the Coons and other senators later.
It was obvious that, without the investigation, the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses Brexit's opponents of political play
In the Sunday Times interview, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the opponents of her plans to leave the European Union of jeopardising the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the interests of the nation with their political play.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, will arrive at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview directly next to May's interview, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacks the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the suggestion that Britain and the EU handle each other's customs duties is "absolutely absurd".
The Wayde Sims murder: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of killing LSU's player.
The police arrested a suspect in the 20-year-old basketball player Wayde Sims' death shooting at Louisiana State University (LSU).
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested on charges of manslaughter, reported by Baton Rouge's police department.
The police released a video of the battle between Sims and Simpson, and they also reported that Sims' glasses fell during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene, and they found Simpson's DNA on it, on the CBS network's WAFB channel.
After questioning Simpson, the police have announced that the young man admitted to shooting Sims.
Advocate's report says the bail was set at 350,000 dollars.
According to a preliminary report issued on Friday by the coroner of East Baton Rouge County, the cause of death is a gunshot wound affecting both the head and neck.
The Bureau thanked the state police in Louisiana for their help in the investigation into the escaped criminals, the criminal lab of the state police, the university police and the residents of the area.
The Athletic Director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the competent law enforcement forces for their “commitment and perseverance in finding the truth”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-metre-high attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where Wayne's father was also LSU's basket.
Sims scored 5.6 points per game in the last season and 2.6 points per match.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach, Will Wade, declared that the news of Sims' death “smoke” and “smoke” the team.
“You’re always afraid that something like this will happen,” Wade said.
Volcano flood Mexico City with ashes
The ash from Popocatepl volcano has reached the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
After the volcanic activity in the crater increased and a total of 183 gas and ash launches occurred in 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Centre asked the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The center has observed several blasphemy and vibrations.
The images shown on the social portals cover the windshields of cars in certain districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
The geophysicists observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 72 km south-east of the Mexican capital, following an earthquake of 7.1 in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The police colluded with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the independence protesters had fought with the police and thousands joined the rival demonstrations on the first anniversary of the disbanding referendum in Catalonia.
A group of regular separatists threw eggs and paint dust at the seizure police, so the streets that were otherwise crowded with tourists were now covered with dense powder paints.
In the late part of the day, further fights broke out, during which the police tried to maintain order with a rubber stick.
The "We don't forget, we don't forgive" slogent independence groups and the unit-party protesters behind the slogan "Live Spain" have stood up to each other for hours.
According to local press reports, fourteen people were treated with minor injuries during the demonstrations.
The tension continues to decrease in the region undergoing the process of independence through the referendum of 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by the Catalan Separatists.
The voters voted in favour of the break-up by a large majority, although the participation rate was rather low, as most of the Unionists had boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year when the police tried to stop voting in the polls with aggressive clashes.
The independence groups were on the street all night on Friday to stop the national police demonstration.
Although it was not possible to prevent it, the demonstration did not go on the normal route.
According to the 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participates in separatist demonstrations, there is no chance that Catalonia will gain independence.
“She was one of the best times of our lives.
I saw my parents drop tears of joy, for which we can vote, but by now our cause has been overthrown," he said.
Although the regional elections last December have succeeded in achieving an important, even if a narrow victory is achieved, the Catalan independence party will find it difficult to maintain their momentum this year after many of their most well-known leaders have gone into voluntary exile or are expected to be arrested for their role in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent exclamation of independence.
According to a 42-year-old auto mechanic, Joan Puig, who recorded the police protest using his phone, the conflict was fired on both sides.
“The situation is getting tense,” he says.
One of the Catalan leaders, Oriol Junqueras, who have been waiting for the negotiations since last year, announced that he would be going to the European elections next Saturday.
"It is most important for me to reject the devaluation of democratic values and the repression represented by the Spanish Government if I participate as a candidate in the European elections", he said.
Londonderry: Police arrested three men driving their car into a house.
The police arrested 33, 34 and 39-year-old men driving into a house in Londonderry several times.
The case happened around 7:30 in the British summer time at Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building themselves were damaged.
They may have shot the car with a tool bow at a given moment.
Menga scored 1-0 to Livingston's Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal was to secure Livingston's victory.
The newly introduced Livingston in the first class brought a big surprise to the Rangers team by getting Steven Gerrard into his second defeat, who has been working as a coach for the ibrox club since 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal meant the real difference, because Gary Holt's team was in a deadlock race with the Hibernian team in second place.
The Gerrards continued to remain unbeatable in the current season of the Scottish League, and next Sunday they will be faced with the first-place Hearts team to whom they are behind eight points.
Before that, however, the Rangers are facing a match in the European League against Rapid Wien on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased its divisional unbeatability series to six wins, which means that the Holt that broke out of Kenny Miller last month hasn't gotten out with the team yet.
Livingston has missed many situations against an impeccable guest team
Holt's team could have won the lead long before the only goal of the game, as their offensive game caused few problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke the opponent's defense, but he pulled the attack too far, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt turned out to be wide after he slipped in to reach Craig Halkett's ball in front of the finish line.
The domestic team let the Rangers play their own game because they were sure that they could disrupt the guests in fixed game situations.
The final goal was born from a situation exactly like this.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a hole in the defense. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who took advantage of it from the middle of the sixteen.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers led the ball-ownership, but domestic defence continued to be impenetrable, and Liam Kelly's gate was hardly in danger.
This trend continued in the second half of the game, except for one situation when Kelly had to defend the Alfredo Morelos attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt was overrun by the Rangers' goalie, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow lost a gate to another free kick in Livingston.
The cross-directional balls continued to reach the sixteenth in Livingston, but the defenders were always driven away. Two criminals were not received by the attack team: one Halkett's entry against Glenn Middleton as an exchange player, and the other one was guaranteed.
"Fine" game from Livingston – game analysis
Tony Macaron from Arena reporting to Alasdair Lamont, reporter for BBC Scotland
Livingston had a phenomenal performance and downgraded the prizes.
The players played well from one to the next and went beyond the expectations.
The team's members and style of play have hardly changed since they returned to the top, but Holt's efforts deserve serious recognition, since the coach's arrival, he's turned the team up.
Several players have brought their best form.
Captain Haltt formed a huge team with excellently organized protection, and Menga gave Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall a proper sweat.
The Rangers played without an idea.
As well as they are at times under Gerrard's leadership, they are now unable to bring that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – they only managed to break down domestic protection once – so Rangers must get together quickly because they slipped back to the middle of the field.
Erdo's mixed reception in Cologne
The meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29) in Berlin was a pleasant atmosphere and fun.
This was the last day of his visit to Germany, which was divided by Erdo. The aim was to improve the relationship between NATO and the countries.
The relationship has deteriorated between the two countries due to issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership of the EU.
He then traveled to Cologne for a newly built, huge mosque-opening ceremony.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks living outside Turkey.
The police, referring to security reasons, banned the gathering of 25 000 people before the mosque, but many of the president's supporters appeared to see the Turkish Head of State.
In addition, hundreds of protestors, including many Kurds, have expressed their disdain for Erdo's policy and that the German Government has decided to accept the Head of State.
The two opposing demonstrations well illustrate the sharing of the President's policy, which some German citizens of Turkish origin celebrate as a hero, while others see the autocrat in it.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker hit a car and lost his life
He lost a biker's life when he hit a car in London.
The crash took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, the high-speed road to Deptford in the south-east of the city, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the passenger car stopped, and the paramedics tried to help the bike, but he lost his life on the scene.
The collision took place just a few months after another bike crash on Childers Street was fatal, just a mile from the location of the Saturday accident.
According to the London Police Department, the police continue to work to establish the identity of the man so that they can notify the relatives.
As a result of the investigation, roadblocks and bus rentals make transport difficult, and the authorities recommend that drivers avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison guards injured during a riot
Six prison guards were injured during the riots of a strictly guarded man in prison, reported by the warden's board.
The riots began at 09:30 a.m. on Sunday at Long Lartin Penitentiary in Worcestershire and were unable to contain them for the time being.
In order to deal with the situation, the competent authorities led a special organization called “Tornado” to the site. Eight prisoners were involved in the riots, who were repressed into a building wing.
The members of the Special Forces had only minor head injuries, which were carried out at the site.
Declaration by the spokesperson of the Penal Enforcement Organisation: “The specially trained prison guard team handles the situation in Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injury.
In our prisons, we do not tolerate violence at any level, and the people responsible will be handed over to the police, and they will be charged with further prison sentences."
In the Long Lartin male penitentiary, more than 500 prisoners are imprisoned, among whom the country's most dangerous criminals are found.
In June, reports say that the warden was to be hospitalized after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In October last year, the Special Forces also needed help to overcome a serious disturbance in which prisoners attacked the prison staff with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (but the situation in the affected areas can improve)
Arizona is rarely reached by tropical depression, but this is what the state is expected to do at the beginning of next week, when the remains of the hurricane named Rosa are sweeping through the desert southwestern region, dramatically increasing the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already ordered flooding from West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada by Monday and Tuesday, as well as to the south-eastern regions of California and Utah; it also affects the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to cross the city of Phoenix directly on Tuesday, which is expected to arrive on Monday night and bring great rains.
The Phoebe meteorological service published the following message on Twitter: “Since 1950 ten tropical cyclones have reached within a 200 - mile radius of Phonenix in the form of tropical storms or depression!
Hurricane Katrina, for example, approached the border 40 miles away (1967).
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict a rainfall of 50-100 mm, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, such as Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other parts of the south-west desert (Central areas of the mountain, Great Basin, etc.), a rainfall of 25-50 mm may be expected, but in some places it may also fall 100 mm.
The rain produced by Rosa can help areas not threatened by lightning, as the area is currently suffering from severe drought.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some rainfalls can have a beneficial effect on the south-western regions affected by the drought.
“According to the American drought monitoring service, more than 40% of Arizona’s territory is hit by minimum extreme drought, which is the second most dangerous category,” says weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first arrive on the coast of Lower California, Mexico.
It remains hurricane-like, and on Sunday morning, bringing a wind of up to 137 km/h, it travels about 600 km south of the country language of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and will be heading north at a speed of approximately 19 km/h.
The storm in the Pacific is meeting colder currents, and it will lose its power.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coasts of Mexico once again as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening hours.
In some areas of Mexico, frequent rainfall can be expected, which significantly increases the chances of flooding.
“The rainfalls can result in a rainfall of between 70 and 150 mm, on average, from Lower California to the Northwest of Sonora, where there may be a rainfall of between 250 mm,” says weather.com.
Rosa will then move on as a tropical storm to the north of Mexico before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of the morning on Tuesday, by then in the form of tropical depression to reach the southern regions of Utah on Tuesday night, sweeping through Arizona.
“The greatest threat caused by Rosa and her remains will be the extreme rainfall in Lower California, the Northwest Sonora, and in the southwest desert regions of the United States,” said the National Hurricane Centre.
Rainfalls are expected to cause life-threatening lightning discharges and loads in desert areas and in mountainous areas should be feared from landslides.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested with suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
At 04:00 local time on Saturday, a injured teenage boy was found in the city of Midsomer Norton Excelsior Terrace.
The boy was taken to a hospital immediately, his condition is "stable".
According to the police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old man was arrested in Radstock, Avon, and Somerset during the night.
The authorities ask the public to contact them if anyone has a mobile phone record.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had to suffer the Democratic Party's "mortgage and anger"
“He who votes for Judge Kavanaugh will vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” said Trump at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, during the nomination of Kavanaugh, the Democratic Party had to suffer “the mischief and anger”.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, where he strongly and passionately denied Christine Blasey Ford's claim that a man had committed sexual assault on her decades earlier as a teenager.
At the hearing, Ford also witnessed and stood up to his previous claims.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans could see with their own eyes” that day Kavanaugh’s “brily and intrepid character”.
“The votes cast in favour of Judge Kavanaugh are one of the best legal experts of our time, who have an impeccable public service history,” said Trump to his supporters in West Virginia.
The president then spoke of Mr Kavanaugh's nomination, while talking about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Just five weeks apart from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running personally, but I'm actually starting," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere to support the best candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats were following the tactics of "obstacles and resistance".
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, and a leading Republican advisor to CNN has said.
Hundreds of people died in an earthquake in Indonesia, the number of dead is rising
Many were driven away by the price, and at least 384 people lost their lives when the huge waves reached the shore. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and a flood on the island of Sulawes, Indonesia, reported on Saturday to local authorities.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival held in the town of Pau on Friday, when the waves nearly six metres (18 feet) high reached the beach at night, many were drifted away and destroyed everything they had come in their way.
The tidal wave was triggered by an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the flood alert came up yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach, they did not flee immediately, so the waves became a victim,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency (BNPB) at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The fountain didn’t just come in, drove cars, drills, houses and everything else from the coast,” Nugroho said, and added that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km/h on the open sea before reaching the beach.
There were some who climbed up the top of the trees and escaped, he said.
About 16 700 people have been evacuated to 24 shelters, please.
A number of destroyed buildings and business premises, several twisted and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water, are seen on the air footage published by the Agency.
On Saturday, further upheavals rocked the coastal city.
The earthquakes could be detected in an area about 2.4 million people live in.
According to a statement by the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) about 200 times more energy was released during the Friday earthquake than from the nuclear bomb that was dumped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The Agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay and that the resulting geographical characteristics could strengthen the effects of the tidal wave.
According to Nugroho, the damage caused is “important, ” and in the disaster thousands of houses were destroyed, and hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels collapsed.
Several victims were found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, and then added that the number of victims so far is 540, and they are looking for another 29.
According to Nugroho, the number of injured persons and the damage caused in the area known as Donggala on the coast of 300 km from Palu (190 km) could be even greater, as it was closer to the Earthquake.
Communication is “absolutely paralyzed, unable to obtain information,” said Nugroho.
"More than 300 000 people live there", says the Red Cross Communication, which also announced that the experts and volunteers of the organisation are on their way to the affected area.
“The situation is already tragic, but it can be much worse,” they added.
The Agency received a number of criticisms on Saturday regarding the fact that it did not inform the population of the palut-struck, but according to the management, the waves already reached the beach when the alarm was issued.
On social media, a man who tries to warn the people on the street from the upper floor of a building with desperate screams.
In a few minutes, a huge water wall will hit the beach, rolling cars and buildings with you.
The Reuters news agency has not been able to verify the authenticity of the recording for the time being.
The earthquake and the flood caused a power outage, impossibility to communicate around Pau, making it more difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army has sent relief supplies of cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the authorities say that the evacuated population will continue to need food and other essential items.
The airport of the city was opened only to facilitate aid work and will be closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers set up on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian Fleet exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team safely arrived from Donggala to the town of Palau, where employees found shelter under tents set up in the courtyard of the office, but during their journey they found signs of terrible destruction, said Doseba.
“They said they saw a lot of shattered houses, ” he added.
- It's a very bad situation."
While relief teams helped to prepare disaster prevention work, some complained that foreign professionals in this area could not travel to Palura.
According to Indonesian regulations, all aid, relief supplies and personnel from overseas sources may be admitted to the territory of the country only if the location of the disaster is declared a disaster-affected area at national level.
This hasn't happened so far.
“The case continues to be treated as a state-of-the-art disaster,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
– Once the government recognises that it is indeed a national disaster, we can allow international aid services, but no notification has yet been made."
On the second night after the Friday Uprising and Fleet, please continue to hope that their loved ones will be among those whose wondrous salvation will smuggle some light into the dark atmosphere of reports about natural disasters.
On Saturday, during the rescue work, a little boy was pulled out of the canal.
On Sunday, the workers managed to free a woman who had two days near her mother’s body, who was in need of ruins.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national parachutist team, prepared two of the missing parachutists for the Asian Games which were held in Indonesia this time at the beginning of the month.
In addition to the missing, other students were staying at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“As a veteran parachutist, what has happened is a great burden on my soul,” he said.
Gendon recalled that when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to spread among the paratroopers, for hours he desperately tried to reach the contestants who were participating in the beach festival.
In addition to the messages, however, only one grey pipe appeared instead of two blue pipe.
“I think that means that the messages could no longer be delivered,” he said.
26 750 dollars were stolen during the loading of a ATM in Newport on the Levee Shopping Mall
Friday morning, thieves kidnapped $26 750 from one of Brink’s’ employees, who was loading an ATM with cash at the Newport on the Levee shopping mall, in a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the money truck was just emptying out a ATM in the entertainment center, and he was about to charge it with additional notes, so Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the announcement.
A man “ approached the Brink’s employee from behind” until he was busy with his work and stole one of the prepared bags.
Witnesses have seen several suspected offenders escape the scene, but the police statement does not state the exact number of suspects.
Anyone providing information on the identity of the perpetrators may contact the Newport police by telephone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper name Yre changed
Kanye West, the rapper's name is Ye now.
The change was announced on Saturday on Twitter with the following message: "The creature previously called Kanye West."
The 41 - year - old West has been called Ye for some time, and the eighth album released in June also has its title.
He announced the change of name before Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present a new album called Yanghi.
In the show, Ariana Grande takes over, who gave up the performance for “emotional reasons”, said the producer of the show.
The new name is not only a summary of the current art name of the rapper – according to previous revelations, it is also of religious importance to West.
“I know that “Ye” is the word most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you,” said West earlier, when he spoke to Big Boy radio director about the title of his album.
- So it's me and me and we're all one.
Kanye means the only one that's become Ye, which is the best in us, the bad, the confusion, the whole thing.
The album rather reflects who we really are."
Ye is one of those famous rappers who like to change their names.
Sean Combs, for example, has been running under the name Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he would now prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-conspirator, JAY-Z, also varied several times by whether his name should be written in capital letters or capital letters.
The Mexican president pledged not to join the army against civilians
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexican president, promised that he would never use the force against civilians in connection with the coming 50th anniversary of the student medals in the bloodbath.
On Saturday, López Obrador, at Tlatelolco Square, promised that “he would never use the army to suppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire in the field to participants in a peaceful demonstration, causing the death of some 300 people, when left-wing student movements showed signs of a strengthening in Latin America.
López Obrador promised to help young people in Mexico – he provides financial benefits to students at monthly level and plans to establish more free state universities.
He argued that unemployment and the lack of education were the two main factors driving young people into the arms of criminal organisations.
The US should double the funding framework for MI-solutions
As China becomes increasingly active in the research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its funding for such research, stated Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and employee of artificial intelligence solutions, who used to work for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This was said after the US Government made notifications on artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the US does not have an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced its related plans: the country's goal is to become the world's number one MI developer by 2030.
“The duplication of the cost framework for MI research would be an appropriate start, as all other countries are significantly behind the US and the next breakthrough in MI will be at the threshold,” said Lee.
Doubled research grants could also double the chance that the United States could take the next major step in the field of artificial intelligence, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month in the care of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovision Ventures. The company made investments in one of China's most important Mi-related companies in Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an MI system that managed to defeat the best American player, Othello, and later acted as a member of Microsoft Research's management and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged the results of the technology competitions previously announced by the US government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and wondered when they would organise the next event, because they would be able to find new future designers.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to obtain the state aid needed for their research, said Lee.
“China does not acidify scientific leaders, but large companies,” he added.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have also signed several large university skulls to work in MI.
According to Lee, an amendment to the immigration policy could also help greatly the US's efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that those with a doctoral degree in the field of artificial intelligence should receive a green card automatically,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China announced its plan for the development of next generation of artificial intelligence.
China's national science foundation provides support to the staff of academic institutions in a similar way, as the US National Science Fund (NSF) and other government organisations share money with American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee explained.
This year, the US Department of Defence established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (MI) where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of a committee called Select Committee on Artistic Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an AI Next initiative,
The NSF currently spends 100 million dollars a year to support MI research.
Meanwhile, the United States of America, which was planning to set up a MI Committee on National Security, has not taken any further steps in this matter for months.
A referendum is held in Macedonia on changing the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in the referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the "Night Macedonian Republic". By this step, they would resolve a decade-long disagreement with Greece, which prevented the country's application for EU and NATO membership from being accepted.
Greece, one of whose provinces is called Macedonia, argued that the name of its northern neighbour indicates a need for a similar area of Greece, and so far it has vetoed NATO and EU membership.
In June, the two governments negotiated a new name for the state, but according to national emotional opponents, the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of most Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Ivanov stated that he would not take part in the referendum, and as a result of the boycott campaign launched, it became questionable whether the 50% participation required for the valid referendum would be achieved.
The question on the ballot notes is as follows: "Does the country support NATO and EU membership and accept the agreement with Greece?".
The supporters of the change of name, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price should be paid in order to allow Macedonia, as one of the countries that have risen in the ruins of Yugoslavia, to have a chance of membership of the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would mean a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the referendum in itself is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have declared that they feel obliged to see the result of the vote.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the State Elections Committee, no irregularities were reported until 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the participation rate reached only 16% until now. This value was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (and finally 66% of the registered voters took part).
“I have come to vote for my children because we have a place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62), who voted in Skopia, the capital.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, wife of Zorica, and son of Dushko, voted for the change of name in Strumica, the referendum of 30 September 2018, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In the statue of Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage and chairs and tents for the boycotters of the referendum.
“We also support the country’s NATO and EU membership, but we want to join proudly, with a raised head, not through the door of the service,” said Kavaldarkov.
– Although we are a poor country, we have not lost our dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia as part of Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership could be attributed to investments in Macedonia that are very much needed by a country with a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think that the majority will support our case, because more than 80% of the country's population is basically in favour of EU and NATO membership," said Zaev after he voted.
He also added that the 'yes' vote means 'insure the future of the country'.
According to the results of a survey published by the Macedonian Political Research Institute last Monday, 30-43% of voters are expected to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation rate.
Based on another survey by the Macedonian TV Telma, a 57% participation rate is expected on Sunday.
For those who want to go to the vote, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation rate must be at least one vote by 50%.
The invalidation of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the West Party government to take power in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero, a player of Manchester City, will gain a goal by lecturing full Brighton defense.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling handled Brighton's defense, so Manchester City won a 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in England.
Aguero scored at 65 minutes like it was the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentinan battle was the first step of the attack on the midfield got a pass, and
He got out in the open between the three Brighton defenses.
Then four green paintings surrounded Aguero.
He was stalking a defender, and then he ran more than that, near the 16th in Brighton.
Then it hit the left for Sterling who showed up there.
The English battle has already returned the ball to Aguero in force within the sixteenth, who finished the action with his right foot, hitting the brighton night watchman, Mathew Ryan, on the right side of the gate.
“Aguero has problems with his legs,” said the reporters, Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City.
– We agreed that you can play 55 minutes, up to 60 minutes.
And that's how it happened.
Fortunately, that's when he scored."
The initial advantage of Sterling's action was achieved by the blues in the British championship battle.
The goal was born in the 29th minute when
Aguero, who is in the field of the Brightonians, was given a great pass.
He launched a beautiful crossbow towards Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane was playing the ball for a while before he started Sterling.
The Blue Battle was just able to slip the ball into the gate before it slipped outside the base line.
City will play with the Hoffenheim team in the Champions League next Tuesday, from 12:55 in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make it harder for Rockies.
Since the Nationals team missed the opportunity to enter the post-season season, there was no reason for them to make a real effort.
However, Scherzer, who is always competitive, is looking forward to playing against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the opponent team still has a chance to play. Rockies has a football advantage in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Baseball League.
The Rockies have secured at least one comforting place with their 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but the first division address is still waiting for you.
"No matter how we no longer stand a chance, we can stand against them that the atmosphere of the audience and the other team in Denver is expected to be at the top of the year.
Of course I'm in the mood to get on the field like that!"
The Nationals team still has to pick the beginner for Sunday, but the news is that Scherzer will be the drummer in this situation.
For Scherzer, who took part in drum training on Thursday, this will be his 34th launch on Sunday, which is usually his day of rest.
The right-handed Washington player has 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts after 220 and 2/3 games this season.
Trump is campaigning in West Virginia
The president also spoke about the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Judge, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the interim elections.
“In November, everything we have done so far is at stake.
We're only five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the greats, the greats, although I am not running in person, but I am leaving in essence, which is why I go everywhere to support the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “Everyone can see what these terrible, radical democratic groups are doing, and they can see it with their own eyes.
They are truly determined, and they are able to deploy any means to regain power, to see wickedness, and to show lowliness.
No matter who they harm, who they clap so they can have control, they have power, they want control and power, but we don't leave ourselves."
According to the President, the Democrats are using "opposition and obstruction".
"They may have seen all this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "inspired and mean and mean and lying".
Namely, he mentioned Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate's Committee on Court Affairs, to whom he declared the assembly's outrage.
“They will remember, what did he say?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what's that?
No, uh, no, let's wait – with very bad body language, that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
It does not tolerate those who freely say what they think
I wasn't surprised at all when, in my own party, the Momentum activists decided to censor my censorship.
After all, I am only the last in a long series of Labour MEPs who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have said what we think.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way because of his unorthodox opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship didn't like me disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In addition, the importance of responsible economic policy on national security and Europe, which are, ironically, the issues which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
At the invitation of the Labour Party meeting held in Nottingham East on Friday, it was said that they wanted a “intelligible and productive meeting”.
For most of my eight years as a local representative of the Labour Party, these meetings on Friday night were exactly the same.
Today, however, sound has changed, and the promise of a more "restricted, polite" policy has been forgotten, if ever realized.
It is becoming increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views and that all opinions are assessed on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party's leadership.
This trend began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple; my colleagues, whom I thought were similar in our political attitude, have recently been increasingly waiting for me to turn their backs on my individual opinion and take a stand for things that I would never agree with anyway, be it national security issues or the single European market.
After all my public speeches, regardless of what I have said, they begin to waste on social media, demand my replacement, criticise the middle policy, and inform me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than many of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me generally focus on politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my fellow politicians who are forced to stand up to sexual and racist attacks on a daily basis, but they do not run away.
The most disappointing aspect of today's policy is that attacks at this level have become standard.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should support the culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we have given up diversity, and with all the "distrust" initiatives and all the changes to the electoral rules, the party's tolerances are shrinking.
Over the past few years, many have advised me to hold back, not be so verbal, and then “it's gonna be all right.”
But that's not why I'm on the political track.
32 years ago, as a student, I joined the Labour Party because I was upset that the Thatcher government neglected schools so much that our classroom almost collapsed, and then I fought for a better approach for the most deprived as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I've never hidden my political views in the water, and I haven't done anything else in the last election.
In Nottingham East, it was absolutely clear to everyone what political positions I represent and on which topics I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who supported the motion on Friday, I would say that in this situation, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm not only families, but also companies and public services, I do not understand why it is necessary to devote so much time and energy to questioning my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
My most important message, however, is not for the members of the Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud that I can serve you, and I promise that any threat of redemption or political action will not discourage me from acting in my own opinion and in the interests of everyone.

Ayr-Melrose 38-17: Ayr breaks to the top unbeatable
Two late attempts were slightly modified in the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr's deserved victory in the most entertaining game of the day, Tennent's Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the table, the only one of the ten teams unbeatable.
Due to their unparalleled protection and over-exploited use of the situation, the Hungarians and Coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We had to meet many challenges in our previous games, but we are still unbeatable, so I have every reason to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, Melrose’s player, said: “We have to admit that Ayr has made much more use of his situation than we do.”
With Grant Anderson's 14-minute experiment, Frazier Climo scored, Ayr came to the advantage. Thanks to the yellow card to the Scottish captain Rory Hughes borrowed from the Warriors, Melrose could have played the difference, but Jason Baggot's attempt did not make the point.
Climo was using a criminal to get Ayr's protection, right in the middle of the day, and then a single experiment, so the first half of the time ended with 17-5 results in favour of Ayr.
Melrose started the second half very hard, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to sell Bagg, reducing the team's downside to five points.
Then the game stood for a long time, as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and had to be removed from the track, and Ayr further increased its advantage in the continuation by trying to get Stafford McDowall, whose winners were removed with the help of Climo.
Blair Macpherson, the captain of Ayr, also received a yellow card, and Melrose managed to prevent Bruce Colvine's experiment in man, thus breaking the pressure on them.
The home team started closing up again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for putting Climo down without a ball, MacPherson introduced a touchdown from the criminal line behind the Ayr storm team.
Climo sold it, which he repeated almost immediately after the reboot, when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kicks and sent Gregor Henry's net forward to try the fifth home.
The lead star of Still Game has started a new career in the hospitality industry.
It seems that one of Still Game's stars, Ford Kieran, is moving towards the catering industry: it turns out that a restaurant manager is at the forefront of a company.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays together with his old comedian, Greg Hemhill.
The couple announced that the next ninth season would be the end of the season, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he became the director of the Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was trying to benefit from Glasgow's "flowering catering industry".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, without the coast, hopes that the court will reopen the way for the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol the Navy Command with sails in La Paz.
There are ocean blue flags floating on the streets.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon proclaim the following motto: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
The memory of the lost coast in Bolivia, which does not have a beach, was taken by Chile in a bloody conflict for resources in the 19th century, and the desire to refloat the waves of the Pacific Ocean is still alive.
These hopes may have been the most powerful for decades now, for Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice in its first five years of October.
“Bolivia has the ball, which floods people with the spirit of belonging and peace, who are looking forward to the end of the game in a positive mood,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
There are plenty of Bolivian observers watching the decision of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Hague Court will stand by Bolivia, and Chile will be obliged to sit at a meeting table after decades of rapsodism, so that Bolivia can gain independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic, native president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial battle that he must continue for next year's re-election, may lose a lot with the Monday judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he announced at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favour of Bolivia, and that it would not change the situation much if its decision were to be favourable to Bolivia.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the power to judge over Chilean territories, and has also pre-empted that it will not influence the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was only six months after the closing talks indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years have not helped Bolivia’s case, but they have even rejected it.
“The issue of sea exit was shifted by the current Bolivian government for its own purposes,” said Zárate.
– Morales' enemy rhetoric also led to the Chilean remaining goodwill."
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue to negotiate at one point, but it will be extremely difficult to engage in dialogue after what has happened.
The two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, represents Bolivia in the Hague, disagrees with the finding that court rulings would have been unusually rapid.
For Bolivia on Monday, a “exceptional opportunity to open a new chapter in relations with Chile” and a chance to “let them both come out of the end of the 139-year conflict,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would have used the sea debate to turn it into a political advantage.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to the Pacific,” she added.
– The judgment gives us the opportunity to see that it is time to go beyond the past."
North Korea: no nuclear decommissioning until they can trust America
Ri Jongho, North Korean Foreign Minister, says that his country will not be the first to lower its nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at the Singapore Summit of the leaders of the two rival countries.
The comment was made when it seemed that American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo was able to resume the closed nuclear negotiations more than three months after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Dzsongun in Singapore.
According to Ri, "I wish" to believe that the U.S. obstruction of the continuing sanctions and the declaration ending the Korean War will never be enough to force North Korea to its knees.
Washington has longed to accept the statement if Phenjan does not take significant steps towards decommissioning.
Both Kim Jsongun and American President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism in Phenjan's commitment to the decommissioning of the arsenal, to which it is likely the only key to the security of the country.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Phenjan next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
At the fashion shows in Paris, there were huge head covers that would soon appear in top-class stores.
If you want to expand your hat collection or fully cover the day, you don't have to search anymore.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headgear as part of their spring/summer collection in 2019, which was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the style of the Paris fashion week audience.
Unpractice hats created sensations on Instagram in the summer, and the fashion designers above put their outstanding works on the runway.
Valentino's most spectacular piece was an overzealous beige hat, decorated with a penlike, wide-scrape, and almost completely swallowed the heads of the models.
Among the other oversized supplements appeared precious - stoned Greek melons, a wizard base, and even a pineapple, which were not really designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also came up with a strange selection of masks just before Halloween.
More of the colored masks were sewn together, and they reminded me of Hannibal Lecter rather than Haute couture.
One was like a scuba mask, accompanied by pipe and glasses, and the other was painted like a melting jar of ice cream.
If you come in with these spectacular pieces, you're lucky.
The Style Analysts predict that huge caps may be on their way to top - class clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path of “La Bomba”, a 60 cm wide straw hat that we've all seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind a somewhat practical hat, which conquers social sites, introduced another piece on the runway: a straw-made beach bag, almost the size of the swimwear model.
The dark orange rafia bag – decorated with rafia boys and a white leather grip on the top – was one of the outstanding pieces of the Jacquemus Spring/Ruor La Riviera collection in Paris on the fashion week.
The stylist of the stars, Luke Armitage, said to FEMAIL: “I expect the huge hats and beach bags to appear in the top-class clothing stores next summer. The designer had such an elemental effect on everyone that it would be difficult to deny the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
This situation has not changed since 2018, which is further reinforced by individual and group success in sport, arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students are studying in such institutions represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and seeking to provide the best possible services for students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen careers and their position as citizens of the world.
In an educational sector where custom school curricula can be designed and introduced, we can see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak a language that you understand, it will reach his head.
But if you speak his language, it will reach his heart."
This is an important reminder, because we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relations and trust with other countries.
This year's exam results show that students from independent schools across the country have produced the best results in foreign languages.
68 per cent of all students studying a foreign language reached a higher level of A (more than 85 per cent).
Based on the data collected from the 74 member schools of the SCIS, 72% of the students received a higher degree in Mandarin, while 72% of the students in German, 69% of the French and 63% of the Spanish students reached Grade A.
These results also show that independent schools in Scotland regard foreign languages as essential knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages as selected subjects have become at least as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics, both independent and other schools.
A 2014 survey of the UK Employment and Vocational Training Committee has shown that 17% of employers find it difficult to fill empty positions due to lack of language knowledge.
From this, we can also see that language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for young people to have a successful career.
As the knowledge of foreign languages is increasingly required in workplaces, language knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
No matter what careers someone chooses, if he has learned a foreign language, he will gain a lifelong knowledge from which he has a clear advantage.
The ability to communicate directly with other nationalities automatically confers a competitive advantage on a multi-lingual candidate.
According to YouGov, where 4000 adults were interviewed in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were not able to speak in any foreign language well enough to speak to others, and France was the only language spoken by more than 10 percent (15 percent).
That is why it is important that we continue to focus on children's language education.
To speak in several languages, especially in the language of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children that allows them to apply for more important jobs as adults.
In Scotland, all schools will deal with different languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese that are expected to be of outstanding importance to the United Kingdom by 2020.
Whatever the interest of the child, you will be able to learn several optional languages at independent schools, and you will be trained by teachers who are experts in your field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and provides them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It is not difficult to see that in the current global business environment, languages are still vital for the future of a country, and this education must also reflect.
In fact, knowledge of modern languages should rather be treated as "international communication skills".
Independent schools offer young people in Scotland the possibility of choice, diverse and high-quality education.
Il faut bien le faire – this must be the case.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will meet Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
It doesn't take long for fans to sit on needles to see LeBron James take the first course in Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lakers coach, Luke Walton, announced that James would play the preseason opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you'll be on the field is still in question.
“More than one and less than 48,” wrote Walton on Lakers’ official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, said that James would probably only play for a limited period of time.
After a few days of training, James was asked what his plans were for Lakers in the pre-season.
“I don’t have to play in this part of my career in the preseason to be ready,” he replied.
Trump's Western Virginia campaign and YouTube channel
Donald Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, will begin a long series of campaign events tonight.
This will be the first of the five belled events of Trump next week, including stops such as Tennessee and Mississippi who support him.
With the postponement of the vote to strengthen the candidate for the vacant seat of the Supreme Court, Trump tries to gather supporters for the forthcoming mid-term elections, as there is a risk that the Republicans will lose power over Congress when the votes will take place in November.
When will Trump's event in West Virginia begin tonight, and where can you follow online?
Trump's speech to Wheeling (Nyugat-Virginia) starts at 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can be followed online through YouTube's live broadcast.
Trump is likely to be affected by the hearing of his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh this week, which has proved particularly tense in the light of the sexual harassment charges, and the Senate's confirmatory vote has been suspended for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
However, the primary objective of the sudden increase in events is to help the situation of the Republicans before the November elections.
According to Trump's campaign advisor, five events next week are “to activate voters and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority currently owned by the Senate and the House of Representatives”, says Reuters.
“To know how to manage Congress in his hands, he is so critical of his political plans that the President will visit as many states as possible. We are looking forward to a frequent campaign period,” reported a campaign speaker asking Reuters to silence his name.
Today’s event in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, “You can also bring supporters from the countries of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and you can get into the media reports in Pittsburgh,” says West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, it will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump's trying to help out his Western-virgin Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who, according to the polls, is not in a favourable position.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must intervene in person to be more involved in the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, Politologist at the University of West Virginia according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: the American team is fighting a full shoulder to the Sunday individuals to keep the hope alive
After three unilateral attempts, the Ryder Cup needed a four-way match on Saturday afternoon.
The lucky and moment-oa's swinging shirt is a fairly air-based sports concept, yet every player believes in it, most of all during competitions such as the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
“They had a six-point lead, and they have only four advantages, so we can say that we have the ball,” Jordan Spieth said, as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, four points still lead Europe and twelve more can be obtained.
The Americans, as Spieth tells us, feel that they finally got a little backwind and can draw encouragement from more than one, including Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both scored three points out of the four.
Spieth proved to be infallible from the start to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
The cries of the Gulf's victory were getting louder as he went forward with the round, hit and balanced with a critical roll in the fourth match, with him and Thomas having double disadvantages after two.
The decisive roll of the game resulted in a cry of joy similar to that of hole 15, a kind that can convince the viewer that not everything has been lost to the American team.
“You just have to dig deep into yourself and only care about your own game,” Spieth said.
That's exactly what's waiting for the players.
Eighteen holes for a chance to leave a trail on your own.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular partner in the Ryder Cup, could score more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's strange but adorable pair brought four out of four, and they seem to be unable to make mistakes.
“Moliwood” was the only pair who did not perform above the par on Saturday afternoon and on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on Friday morning during the last nine stages of the morning.
Thanks to this series, and the dynamics between them and the people who supported them in a lush way, they became the standard by Sunday, and no one is expected to win Europe's victory in Le Golf National's orbit with the sun's rest than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be best to win one at a time, with different holes.
However, it would be early to celebrate the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon executed Sergio García, the hero of the morning four when he played with Alex Noren.
Once, one and two times overboard, the Spanish and Swedish hit the first nine holes, which pushed them into a wave valley that they had no chance of climbing out of.
On Sunday, there will be no one to help you out of your pit.
The four-ball games and the four-game games are extremely entertaining from a close point of view thanks to the interaction of the couples. You can observe what advice you give, what advice you do not give, and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is starting to have a significant advantage for the last day, but this section 4 has shown that the American team has the curative skills needed to fight, although many of them have been absent, especially from the American side.
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with an advantage of 10-6
Europe can start the last day of the Ryder Cup with a good advantage, after the four-ball and four-ball matches on Saturday have been completed with 10-6 results against the United States.
The two-legged Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the hair, cutting two wins against the sick Tiger Woods, raising the difference to four points in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, which tries to recover the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the ever-erring US team in the morning four-ball matches, winning the series to 3-1.
America has shown greater resistance during the fours, bringing in two games, but they still couldn't get the difference off.
Jim Furyk's team should score eight points from the 12 single games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in the series, while he and Molinari – who are only called Molliwood after a sensation weekend – are the second pair of Ryder's history, which won four points in the four opening games.
After they beat the Woods-Patrick Reed pair in the four-balls, they beat the unmotivated Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau to a decisive 5-4-4.
Woods, who has dragged himself through two games on Saturdays, has sometimes given him some talent, but he has lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and fours, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting during the morning four-balls, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson, and in the four-ways he was defeated by 2-4-1 by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third rank of the world ranking.
However, Europe has not succeeded in all this pleasant, windy day, southwest of Paris.
The three-time title protector Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans how to do this on Saturday.
A painful 2-4-1 victory was won against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter pair in the four-balls and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 ratios after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only twice did a team come back from the four-point disadvantage in individual competitions, although a tie for Furyk's title team is enough to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of being only the second best, a Sunday conflict seems to be quite unlikely.
"No way" for North Korea to unilaterally resign if you do not trust your negotiating partner
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions only increased the distrust of the United States of America, and there is no way that the country would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Jongho, at the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation, said that North Korea has taken significant and generous steps last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile experiments, closing the site of nuclear experiments and promising that it will not expand its nuclear arsenal and the scope of nuclear technology.
“Unfortunately, however, we do not see similar responses from the Americans,” he said.
– Without confidence in America, we feel that the security of our nation is not guaranteed, and in such circumstances, it is impossible for us to be unilaterally and first cut off."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's disappointment at Washington's opposition to the idea of "chasing" nuclear decommissioning, which, in the scenario, would be rewarded by North Korea for the steps it has taken so far, its declaration seemed to be significant, because it did not clearly reject the unilateral nuclear decommissioning, as Phenjan has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Dzsongun and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a powerful American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June and in which Kim promised to work on the "nuclear decommissioning of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump guaranteed the integrity of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to make an official stop at the end of the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States considers that Phenjan must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington did not allow for the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“ America insists that we start with nuclear decommissioning and increases the pressure by sanctions to force its will on us, and protests against the possibility to declare the end of the war, ” said Ri.
– The idea that we may be forced to kneel with sanctions is the desire of those who do not know us.
The problem is that unrelieved sanctions only increase our suspicion."
Ri did not mention that there would be a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the President of the United States has mentioned specifically in the UN at the beginning of the week.
Rather, the Minister pointed out that three meetings were held between Kim and the South Korean President Mun Gein in the last five months and added: “If the country concerned by the nuclear decommissioning were South Korea, not the United States, then the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean Peninsula would not have been in such a plight.”
Nevertheless, Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he announced at the UN General Assembly that the mission of the North American continent with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump called him "the evil president" Kimet a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump in the UN, who threatened North Korea with “total destruction” last year, gave thanks to Kim that he had the courage to take steps towards decommissioning, but also noted that there is still a lot of work to be done and that the sanctions will remain until North Korea implements nuclear decommissioning.
On Wednesday Trump said that there was no time limit, i.e. “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Phenjan for the steps taken so far.
On the other hand, American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said in the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council must be applied in an unbroken manner until we have reached the actual, final, demonstrable nuclear decommissioning."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea in order to reduce the financing of Phenjan's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ríve on the break of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would return to Phenjan the following month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo's been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
After leaving Phenjan in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of making "gengster-like claims" hours later.
In the course of the meeting with Mun this month, North Korea promised to cut down a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States also took "sufficient steps."
According to Mun, the "good steps" Kim mentioned would be security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and measures that could lead to the normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taught to relax enough
This year, Harvard University has encouraged students to sleep more and more, fighting the whole-night learning of caffeine, increasingly gaining space against the macho culture.
An academic concluded that students from the world’s number one university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care for themselves.
The course was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who teaches sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical College, and is a specialist in the Brigham and Women's Hospital.
It encouraged the course to develop a lecture earlier on the impact sleep deprivation has on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked me, “Why am I facing this as a graduate now?”
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," he told Telegraph.
During the course launched for the first time this year, students will be briefed on the fundamental impact of appropriate sleep habits on their educational and sports performance, in addition to the positive impact on their general mood.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical College and director of the health service at the University, decided to start the course because during the week the students were found to be exceptionally sleepy.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
One example is a photo of a college room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, gym shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the way sports performance is influenced by insomnia and the importance of the sleeping routine.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
They present a map of the university area with interactive icons to encourage participants to reflect on the daily routine.
“We know that we will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to such knowledge – as they have the right to be aware of the health effects of smoking –" said Professor Czeisler.
The culture continues to flourish, in which it is a performance to learn one night, he said, adding that modern technology and the constantly increasing pressure on students will lead to growing problems of sleeplessness.
Adequate and high-quality sleep is a “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even against obesity, as sleep deprivation forces the brain into a starving way and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler design the course, a 19-year-old California student who studied chemistry and biophysics, and last year at Harvard he took one of the professor's courses as his first teacher.
He said that the people who heard him were opening their eyes and encouraged him to be sworded by the start of a university level training.
It hopes that, as a next step, postgraduate students will be able to participate in a similar training programme before taking up a position in the competition.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up an alert for bed, a wake-up alarm for awakening, and become familiar with the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electrical screens and LED light sources, which can easily shock them out of their daily rhythms and make it difficult to sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1-0: Menga beats Gerrard's men and gets scored
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb hit Steven Gerrard's lost team in 1-0 in Livingston.
The ibroxians tried to win their first foreign victory after the 4-1 victory in St. Johnstone in February, but Gerrard's second defeat so far was suffered by Gary Holt's team as the manager of the 18 matches. So they missed the first seat of Ladbrokes Premiership (the Scottish Championship) at Hearts.
Menga hit me seven minutes before the mid-terms, and the Rangers' unmotivated team wasn't even close to getting even.
While the Rangers slipped down to sixth place, Livingston clinged to third place, simply because of the score difference, missed Hibernian.
In addition, Rangers may face further difficulties after Calum Spence's head injury required medical attention due to an object likely to be dumped from the guests' sight.
Gerrard changed eight points on the team that got into the semifinal of the Betfred Cup with the sweep of Ayr.
Holt went into orbit with the same 11 people who took a point from Hearts last week and would certainly have been happy to watch his perfected team choke his opponent's game wherever he wanted.
Although the Rangers were in possession of the ball, Livingston took more with what he got.
They could have scored in the first two minutes, when Menga first shot Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor's gate, but the midwayer couldn't sell the zipper.
Keaghan Jacobs had a low-level free kick at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow only hit the gate.
The Rangers took the lead, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he deserved to be punished at the 15th minute when he collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson took away his Colombian complaints.
The Rangers were only able to launch a shot at the first two half-life gates, but the former ibrox goalie Liam Kelly was hardly troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livi's attempt in the 34th minute faced the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, even for their hard work.
The Rangers have once again missed a straitjacket forced by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react in time when Declan Gallagher pushed the ball in to Scott Robinson, who found Menga a great way to finish easy.
Gerrard decided during the break, switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and it almost immediately affected the game, when the outermost Morelost jumped, but the impressive Kelly blocked in time.
Livingston continued to reach out to play exactly what was right for him, and Lithgow and Halkett swept the long balls apart.
Holt's team could have had a bigger advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor took the net well and hit Jacobs' position before Lithgow was left in an angle.
Glenn Middleton, in exchange for the Rangers, tried to fight another eleven when Jacobs and I got stuck, but Thomson couldn't be convinced.
Omanach: the inventor of the Geiger counter
A detail of our "Sunday Morning" almanch: 30 September 1882, right now, 136 years ago... the day when the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that could have resulted in the creation of a device known as Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has since become one of the basic instruments of science and has become part of the pop culture thanks to the 1950 film, "Bells of Coronado" by the strange cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this miracle?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter.
If you put this headphone on, you can hear the sounds of atoms emitted because of the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Hey, listen, it's a bit of a patty."
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But he lives on in his invention.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” abnormal cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy abnormal cells
When given as part of a treatment, the immune system is taught to recognise abnormal cells.
The method forms part of the need to extract the immune cells from the patient and then modify them in a laboratory.
Thus, they can “see” the protein that is accompanied by a variety of cancers. The treated immune cells are injected back into the patient.
One experimental vaccine has achieved promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to detect abnormal cells could say goodbye to her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is part of the extraction of immune cells from the patient; their modification in the laboratory to ‘see’ a protein called HER2 that is commonly associated with multiple cancers; then the replanting of cells.
Jay Berzofsky, professor of the American National Cancer Research Institute (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine in our possession.”
HER2 “encourages the growth of various types of cancer,” including breast, ovary, lung and rectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method based on highlighting immune cells and ‘teaching’ them to attack cancer cells has previously been successfully used to treat one type of leukaemia.
The role of Kanye West SNL, wearing the MAGA cap, has peaked in a disgraceful tirada in support of Trump.
It didn't work out too well.
Kanye West was whistled in the Saturday Night Live studio after an incoherent manifestation in which he praised American President Donald Trump and then announced that he would apply for the presidency in 2020.
After performing the third song of that night, Ghost Town, in the hat of Make America Great Again, he began to speak against the Democrats and again stressed his support for Trump.
“In many cases, when I speak to someone who is white, he asks, ‘How can you like Trump, because he is racist?’
If I were interested in racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL's show was opened by Matt Damon with a parody in which Brett Kavanaugh made a joke about his testimony to the Senate Justice Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's sexual harassment charges.
Although not released, the video of West's speech was uploaded to social media by Chris Rock's humorist.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the upload.
West even complained to the audience that he was being plucked behind the scenes because of his hat.
“They scared me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out in that hat."
I'm scared!
And they said I was in the sunken place," said the Washington examer.
West continued: “Do you want to see a sunken place? I'm going to wear my Superman cape, because that means they can't tell me what to do.
Try to love."
His manifestations were accompanied at least twice by a whistler from the audience, and SNL’s participants seem to have been embarrassed, according to one of the witnesses to Variety: “The whole studio is silent."
Instead of the singer Ariana Grande, Westet was invited at the last minute, whose former friend Mac Miller rapper died a few days before.
West also raised questions when he performed the song I Love it dressed as Perrier glasses.
West was assured by the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, in a tweet: “One of the bravest spirits:
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, said that West was simply "herself, and that's great."
“But I have decided not to reward anyone (by buying music or fashion articles or by supporting “art”) who I believe you have the ideology and the dissemination of which is harmful to the community to which I belong.
He's free.
But we did, too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, now he is “the creature previously known as Kanye West.”
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's gone into Diddy's tracks, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
His rapper partner Snoop Dogg also recorded Snoop Lion's name, and, of course, the late legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.
They're accusing the Belfast restaurant delay of attempted murder.

Kit Harington, the Star of the Thrones, finds excessive masculinity harmful
Kit Harington is most often known as Jon Snow for the Battle of Thrones, and he often takes a sword in his heroic series, full of violence in the Middle Ages.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke against the stereotypical macho heroes, stressing that, in view of such heroes, young boys may often feel that hard action is needed to combat respect.
In his statement to The Sunday Times Culture, he said that something was going wrong, and he asked how to deal with the problem of the adverse effects of excessive masculinity in the #MeToo era.
The star who recently married his 31-year-old serial colleague, Rose Leslie, said that he thought it would be very important to remedy the problem.
“I personally have quite a deep touch on this matter – how is the representation of manhood so distorted? ” the actor asked.
– What have we taught men in their childhood about the problem we are now facing?"
According to Kit, television is also responsible for the spread of the distorted image of manhood, since the programmes often feature very masculine characters.
He added: “What was born with us, and what is it that we learn?
What does the street and TV tell young boys that make them feel like they can only be men in this way?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – and how we can change that.
'Cause it's obvious that something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he stated that after the summer season of the series he would not be included in Thrones' history series or sequences, because he was “sufficient with battles and horses”.
From November to November, Kit Sam Shepard True West will play the main role in the reprocessing of his film, which is about a producer and his brother, who has taken advantage of it.
The actor told me that the best thing the Thrones gave him was his wife, Rose, who he met when he was making the show.
“I met my wife on the set, so I could thank my future family and my life ahead of me for the series,” said Kit.
He played Rose Ygritte, who was in love with Kit's character Jon Snow in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's Scottish family estate.
HIV/AIDS: New patients increased by 14% in China
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS in the country.
Health officials say this means more than 820 000 people involved.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, the number of cases reported increased by around 40 000.
Compared to the past, a significant majority of newly infected patients are sexually infected with the disease.
The disease has spread rapidly by spilling previously infected blood in parts of China.
However, at a conference in the province of Jünnas, health officials stated that the number of such cases had been reduced to almost zero since then.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increased by 100 000 in China.
The transmission of HIV by sexual means is a serious problem for the Chinese LMBT community.
homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong since then.
Based on estimates in various studies, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men eventually marry women because of the conservative values of the country.
In many cases, the disease has spread due to inappropriate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has been providing universal access to HIV medicines as part of the problem-solving programme.
Maxine Waters denies one of her staff leaking the data of Republican senators and condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
American Congressman Maxine Waters rejected charges on Saturday that a member of his crew had released the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia side of the senators.
According to the Democrat Member of Los Angeles, the claims in question were distributed by experts and websites on the "wide right" side.
“Failure, lie and even more mean lies,” wrote Waters on Twitter.
The information reported included the address and telephone number of Senator Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch in Utah.
The information was released on Thursday. The publicist's identity is unknown, but it is certain that they were published from the Capitol Hill during the senate hearing of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidate for sexual harassment.
The leak occurred shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, are linked to Waters' office as a source, and data were reported about a member of Waters' crew, says The Hill.
“These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars,” Waters continued.
– My staff is not responsible for leaking information. However, their right to anonymity, protection of personal data and security is damaged by fraudulent and lying accusations.
These charges are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars."
Waters' statements on the Internet were quickly put to criticism. Ari Fleischer, former Press Secretary of the White House, was among the critics.
“It’s an angry denial,” wrote Fleischer.
– Based on this, it seems that Waters does not have the blood control necessary for the office of representatives.
If someone is accused of something he didn't do, he can't react angryly.
You can't be rude.
You can't question the prosecution's motives.
He must remain calm and calm."
Waters' reaction was compared to that of Judge Kavanaugh's democratic party critics, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, who is a Republican candidate for the position of Waters representatives in the mid-term elections, also shared his views on Twitter.
“If it is true, it is serious,” he wrote in his message.
In his statement, Mr Waters stated that his office had informed the "appropriate authorities and police authorities" in the case of false charges.
"We will see to it that the perpetrators find out," Waters continued, and that they are legally held accountable for all acts that endanger or harm any member of the crew."
Johnny English strikes again, or Rowan Atkinson's lame spy game
Today, it has become a tradition to search for references to Brexit in all British-related films, and there is no exception to this, neither is the Frenchman running under the name Johnny English, whose first part, Johnny English in 2003, nor the second part of Johnny English recharged in 2011.
Will the British nation’s new export product be sarcastic, self-parading satyrs, in which we are living up to our own obvious lameness?
So sure that the smug, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English had enough mutation for another return – it is clear from his name that this comedian character was created so that the crowds of people in the movies of non-English-speaking countries of the world could laugh at it.
Johnny English is, of course, a pushless secret agent who thinks himself to be a bit of a winner with a bizarre manner of manners, so he reminds Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and sometimes the guy who contributed to the presentation of the main title of the Firefighters at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
The character is originally based on the mysterious international traveler that Atkinson once played in a long forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial and who left chaos everywhere.
There's a good moment or two in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved Johnny English, dressed in medieval armor, approached a helicopter, and then the rotors knocked on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson's comedian veins apply well in the film, but the film's humor doesn't really work, and it doesn't even work, because these days, "serious" franchises like James Bond movies or the Mission Impossible series have the courage to reach the instrument of humor.
To feel that the film's humor is more aimed at children, and to me, Johnny English's successful adventures in mischief do not reach the level of ingenuity and genius that Atkinson brings in the silent scenes of Mr. Bean's series.
The starting point of the film is eternal: Great Britain is in serious danger.
A cyber criminal hacked into the super-secret online network of the British spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents to the biggest horror of the agent Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately only had such a small role in the film.
This could be the last angle to the casket of the self-sufficient and sharing prime minister, whose political popularity is already in ruins: Emma Thompson practically acts Theresa Mayt and brings everything out of the otherwise poor-written character.
His intelligence advisors tell him that since all active agents have been identified, he has to put a calm agent on the job.
Of course, this calmed agent is the two-left Johnny English, who has been working as a teacher in an outstanding school since his retirement, but, unlike the curriculum, he teaches children spying – there are, of course, funny scenes here, while English presents the basics of spying to a kind of “Rocksuli”.
English is quickly delivered to Whitehall, where you will meet your former, suffering gun carrier, Bough, who is now being played by Ben Miller at the emergency briefing.
Bough has been married since then and has also married the captain of a submarine, whose mouth is always to the ears – the captain is played by Vicki Pepperdine, who is called for much better roles.
So the two-legged "Batman and Robin" pair of His Majesty's National Security Service will again go into action and face Ophelia Bulletova, played by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko as a woman of true destiny.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is increasingly being encircled by the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's digital problems: his name is Jason Volta, and Jake Lacy is being formed.
English and Bough will begin their clown mission: they will burn down a fancy French restaurant as a waiter, and then, in the face of an amazing mess, they will smuggle themselves into Volta's luxury yacht, and English will actually free the hell out of it when you try to get to know Volta's apartment by using a VR-headset.
These stations are needed to get to the end of the story, but whatever it is you've managed to do for fun and turn around, it might give you a little too much impression of a child's film.
The outcome is quite mediocre.
Like the other Johnny English films, I still have the question: can the British film industry finally give Rowan a talent role to Rowan Atkinson?
The British Labour Party denies the introduction of a four-day working week while paying the British a five-day working wage
Jeremy Corbyn's working party is working on a radical project, introducing a four-day working week, all with workers working for a five-day pay.
The party is said to want workers to benefit from the revolution of artificial intelligence (MI) by providing employees with an extra day off due to increased income.
According to the draft, the workers would be given a three-day weekend, while they would be taking home as much as they have done so far.
According to sources, the idea would be to "be" in the party's economic programme, which aims to bring the balance sheet language to the workers in the country.
The idea of a four-day working week is supported by the Trade Union Congress, which says that workers can benefit from a changing economy.
One of the leading officials of the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen from day to day, the four-day working week is an idea that fits well into the party's programme which will be able to use the balance sheet language in the economy and also fit into the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party campaigned at the 2017 parliamentary elections with the promise of a four-day working week.
The idea, however, does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: "The four-day working week is not one of the policies supported by the Party, and the question is not even on the agenda."
John McDonnell, shadow finance minister, presented his vision of the socialist revolution affecting the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said that he was determined to fight to regain power from the "unscrupulous directors" and the "profit beneficiaries" of the regime.
If the plans of the shadow finance minister were to be implemented, the shareholders of the water service companies would not be able to recover the full profits they owe them, because a labour government would use "deductions" as a punishment for the harmful activities assumed.
McDonnell also confirmed that it was planning to make the employees a member of the Board of Directors and create Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would allocate 10% of the shares of private companies to the employees, which could thus acquire 500 important dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy in the 60 Minutes show have told us whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
As a result of the FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh at least a week later than the original date, the final vote on the election of Kavanaugh as Supreme Judge will be held.
In his interview on Sunday 60 Minutes, journalist Scott Pelley, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked the Republican senators if the FBI could find anything to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” said Kennedy.
– That's what I said before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the case went off, the charges came up, and I asked him, “Did you?”
His answer was firm and clear."
But Graham's vote seems to be concrete-proof.
“I have already decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and I would need extremely serious charges to change my mind,” said Graham.
– Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know Brett has strongly denied the claims,” added Graham, Christine Blasey, addressed to Ford.
And none of the people named by Dr. Ford have proven the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don't think anything new is gonna happen."
What is a Global Civil Festival and have you managed to reduce poverty?
The annual music event in New York, the Global Citizens' Festival, will begin on Saturday. At the festival, world stars will appear to stand up for a truly noble goal: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizens' Festival is now held for seven times, it is expected that tens of thousands will be held at the Central Park's Great Pazsit, where participants will not only enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes' performance, but will also draw attention to the real purpose of the event: the eradication of the deep poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival was first held in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is run by an international interest-enforcement group aimed at eradicating poverty by involving more and more people in the active fight against poverty.
The concert can be given free tickets (unless they are willing to pay for the VIP ticket) to perform certain tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a leading politician, a telephone call, or any other relevant activity to draw attention to the purpose of the project: the eradication of poverty.
But how successful has global citizens been in achieving their goals in the last 12 years?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with a concert ticket to convince others of the importance of action, or is it just another form of the so-called "clickivism" when people feel that they have actually contributed to a case by signing an online petition or writing a Twitter message?
Since 2011, global citizens have reported that more than 19 million "actions" have been carried out by project supporters, which have served a number of different objectives.
According to the organisation, these actions contributed to the allocation of $37 billion by world leaders to policies and commitments to combat poverty, which could have an impact on the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, of which 10 billion dollars have already been paid or collected during the fundraising process.
The group estimates that the money collected had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between investors and contractors based in the United Kingdom, which aims to "help children reach their potential". The organization promised Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate hunger after receiving more than 4700 Twitter messages from "global citizens".
“With the support of the UK Government and donors, national governments and similar global citizens, we can banish social injustice and malnutrition among the footnotes of history books,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition to the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claims that, having requested the United Kingdom to improve the food of mothers and their children in over 5,000 actions, the government has allocated resources to the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the food of 5 million women and children.
One of the often repeated questions published on the website of the Global citizen is: “Why do they think that deep poverty can be eliminated? ”
According to the answer of the Global citizen, “It will be a long and difficult journey, in which we sometimes get stuck and sometimes fail.
But like the previous civil rights and anti-segregation movements, we achieve our goal because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weekly, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae will perform at this year's New York event, and the programmers will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Minister for the Interior: US Navy "blocking" to prevent Russian energy exports
"If necessary", Washington would also use the Navy to combat the entry of Russian energy carriers into the market, such as Russian energy could not reach the Middle East," quoted Ryan Zinke, American Home Minister, the Washington Inspector.
Zinke claimed that Russia's active presence in Syria, in particular as regards Russian operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian government, is only an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
“I think they are only there in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and the south of Europe,” Zinke said in a statement.
And the Home Secretary says there are ways to stop the Russians.
“The United States of America, with its Navy, is able to ensure that maritime routes are open and can block them if necessary, so that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” Zinke said.
Zinke directed his words to participants in an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance group – the non-profit group defines itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington's actions against Russia and Iran and noted that they were practically the same methods.
"Iran and Russia can be sanctioned in the same way economically: using existing energy sources and introducing new ones", Zinke said, while calling Russia a "one-dimensional economy", pointing to the country's dependence on fossil fuels.
The statements coincide with the Trump Government's plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus excluding Russia from the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Therefore, the leading officials of the Trump Government, including the President himself, convince Germany to stand back from the "unfair" pipeline project called the Northern Stream 2, which, if implemented, will make Germany a "steal" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the current capacity is doubled to 110 billion cubic metres, with a USD 11 billion North Current 2 wires only an economic project.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is so violently opposed to the project, which is the manifestation of unfair competition.
"I assume that we are in the same position that energy should not be used for pressure and that consumers should be given the opportunity to choose their suppliers freely," said Alexander Novak, Russian energy minister after a meeting with the US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow.
The American effort to convince the Americans has been reversed, as Germany has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Association (BDI), called on the US not to intervene in the EU's energy policy, as it did in the case of bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I consider it a problem when a third state intervenes in our energy affairs,” said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industry Association (BDI) following the last meeting between Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren Massuchusetts "requires seriously" to launch for the presidency in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren Massuchusetts said on Saturday that, after the mid-term elections, he was "seriously considering" to run for the presidency.
Warren in Massachusetts, at a city meeting in Holyoke, confirmed that he was considering leaving.
“It is time for women to enter Washington and restore the poorly functioning government, and it is also time for a woman to be president,” said Warren, The Hill.
– After 6 November, I am seriously considering running for the presidency."
At the city meeting, Warren was critical of Donald Trump and told that he thought he was going in the wrong direction.
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy,” said Warren.
Warren literally criticised Trumpot and Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidate.
In a Friday's Twitter message, Warren wrote, "Well, of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, on the basis of a survey published on Thursday, most of Warren's Massuchusetts voters do not think that Warren should run for the presidency in 2020.
Based on a study by the Political Analysis Centre of the University of Suffolk and the Boston Globe, 58% of the Massuchusetts voters voting for Warren are saying that the senator should not run for the presidency, while
32% of them support Warren's presidential candidate.
According to the survey, the former Governor of Deval Patrick would be supported by the majority of those questioned, 38% would be opposed, and 48% would be opposed.
In the context of the 2020 presidential election, among other things, the names of high-ranking democratic politicians such as former Vice-President Joe Biden or Senator Bernie Sanders Vermont have emerged.
Based on the Associated Press report, Biden will decide whether to leave until January.
Sarah Palin Track Palin's PTSD meeting at Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after he applied in September
He was arrested for domestic violence on Monday night
“The things my son has been going through since he came home, I understand the other families who are experiencing the terrible consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are returning home,” said Sarah Palin at the meeting in Tulsai in Donald Trump Oklahoma.
He called the arrest of Palin's son the "elevant in the room" and said that his son, like other war veterans, was "removed, hard back, and he kept thinking about the proper respect for the service that his fellows, pilots and all the other members of the army did for the country."
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support the judicial review of asylum policy
Eighteen Member States and Washington D.C. also support the judicial review of a new American asylum policy that prevents those who escape violence by gangs or within the family.
Representatives from 18 different Member States and Washington D.C. wrote an expert letter on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who attacks politics in court, says NBC News.
The full name of the applicant for the Grace vs. Sessions brought against the federal policy by the American Civil Society in August has not been disclosed.
According to the applicant woman, her partner and her “sons of violent crime” abused her, but American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She's being held in Texas.
The prosecutors of Grace-backed states described El Salvador, Honduras and Guadeloupe as places where many asylum applications have come from to the United States, as violence committed by criminal gangs and domestic violence is a constant problem in these countries.
The new American asylum policy withdrew a decision taken by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA) in 2014, which allowed immigrants without documents to submit an asylum application when fleeing domestic violence.
Karl Racine, D.C.'s Attorney General, stated in a Friday's statement that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law."
"All asylum applications under federal law must be assessed in accordance with the facts and circumstances applicable and such an obstacle violates this principle", says the expert letter.
In addition, the prosecutors stated in the letter that the policy against immigration is detrimental to the American economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and ‘fill the lowest level of employment’.
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions instructed asylum judges not to give asylum to victims of domestic violence and crime groups.
"The right of asylum is a matter for those who leave their country because of racial, religious, national, membership of a specific social group or political conviction, or because of a well-founded fear of persecution," said Sessions when the policy was announced on 11 June.
The right to asylum has not been invented to solve all the problems facing people worldwide, no matter how serious they are.
Desperate rescue in Palu, double the number of dead, rescue companies racing with time
The situation of the survivors is becoming more and more unforeseeable.
“Everybody is very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while calming her febrile little boy in a disaster in one of the evacuation centers of Palau.
- The ambulances pick up the bodies every minute.
We barely have drinking water."
Some residents returned to their homes to save them from the wet things that could still be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, which were also damaged by the 7.5-strength earthquake, fail to supply people.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harist with a broken spine and shoulder, were brought to the Palui Military Hospital. Patients were provided outside the hospital building due to the high-strength extremities.
The man’s eyes were filled with tears when he remembered the way the fifth - floor hotel room in which he and his wife and daughter were occupied was shaken into the devastating quake.
“There was no time to escape.
I think I was stuck in the fallen walls – Haris said to the Associated Press and added that his family came to town because of a wedding.
– I heard my wife screaming for help, and then she was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador is accusing China of ads of propaganda in the country.
The Chinese ambassador of the United States accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the American press. This happened a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-sided advertisement in an American daily that highlighted the mutual benefits of US-China trade relations.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to his announcement in the China Daily Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest number of copies, while accusing China of trying to intervene in the American Congress elections on 6 November.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to intervene in the American elections is, according to some US officials who have declared to Reuters, a new stage in his increasingly strong action against Washington China, which is aimed at putting China under pressure.
Although it is not unusual for foreign governments to promote trade with their country through advertising, there is a growing trade war between Beijing and Washington, during which new and new customs duties are imposed on each other's imports.
According to American and Chinese experts, Chinese customs duties in response at the beginning of the trade war sought to target exporters from countries in which Trump and the Republican Party are popular, including Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the Chinese Ambassador of the United States and former governor of Iowa for several cycles, stated that Beijing was harming American workers, farmers and shops, since the state of Iowa is exporting significant quantities of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in his opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that “China is still agitating our country by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“The Chinese Government is taking advantage of the American tradition of freedom of speech and press, which is highly respected by the fact that it is spreading propaganda in paid ads placed in the Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
– However, if we go to a Beijing newspaper store, we can hardly find critical articles. The Chinese press does not faithfully reflect the different, different opinions of the Chinese people on the growing growth prospects of the Chinese economy, as the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party."
Branstad added that “One of China’s most famous newspapers refused to present” his article, but he did not name it.
Analysts say Republicans can alienate female voters before the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh scandal
Analyses show that many high-ranking Republican politicians will defend Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidate in the crossfire of sexual harassment charges, and in particular they will lose support for women voters before the mid-term elections.
The case caused intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly declared that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be withdrawn, says Grant Reeher, a Politologist at Maxwell School at the University of Siracusa in a Saturday article in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts about the fact that the last minute FBI investigation proposed by Senator Jeff Flake in Arizona will be sufficient to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – not tomorrow or November –” said Karine Jean-Pierre, the head adviser and national spokesperson of the Progressive Group MoveOn in Washington, D.C. on Friday.
According to Mic's report, on Friday morning, in the Senate corridor, some protesters were scandalous about “November!” because despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Republican-controlled Justice Committee decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be amazing", said independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news site.
“Many say that it has already been extremely high, and that is true.
But it may be even higher, especially among the insecure female voters in the suburbs and young people (18-29 years), who, although not excited for the president, often do not go to vote."
Even before Ford's public confession, the analysts assumed that he could strike back the Republicans if they continued to stand up to Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. Since then, Ford has described in detail why he accused the Supreme Court candidate of sexual harassment.
“The Republican Party has lost its way to an indiscretion,” said NBC News at the beginning of last week, Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Commission.
"This is not only about the Commission's vote and the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is named, but also about how the Republicans handled the case and how they acted with Ford," emphasised Guy Cecil, Director of the United States of America for the Election of Democrats.
It seems, however, that the Americans have fairly shared in whether Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony is true. Kavanaugh is believed by a little more than Ford.
Based on a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents believed Ford's testimony, and 35% of respondents gave Kavanaugh the same answer.
In addition, 38% of respondents believe that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied in his testimony, while only 30% of Ford believed that.
According to Flee's motion, the FBI is currently investigating the authenticity of Ford's claims, as is the case with another accuser of Kavanaugh, Deborah Ramirez, on the Guardian.
A week ago, Ford swore to the Senate Justice Committee that he was being harassed drunk by Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party in the 1980s when they both studied at Yale.
The inventor of the world network would launch a new internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches the launch to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that is based on the open source platform of Berners-Lee, Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where to store their data and who to access each information.
In his exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was to ‘over-the world’.
“We have to do it now,” he said about the start-up.
- It's a historic moment."
The application allows people to create their own "personal online data store", known as POD, using Solid technology.
This may include lists, work lists, calendars, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available from the same browser at the same time.
In the personal online repository, the unique thing is that the user can fully decide who has access to his or her data.
This is referred to as ‘the exercise of the right of self-determination of individuals over data’.
John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, says that it is the task of the company to provide resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contractual developers working on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week onwards, world technology developers will be able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on Inrupt.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team do not ask “Facebook and Google to introduce the technology that brings complete change from day to day to day, to put the business models of the companies at the top of their heads.”
"We don't ask permission from them."
Berners-Lee, published on Saturday, wrote that Inrupt’s “mission of commercial energy and the provision of an ecosystem that will help to protect the integrity and quality of the newly built network of Solidra.”
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Technical University of Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has taken part in discussions on Internet neutrality as an important input.
Despite the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am infinitely optimistic about the next age of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann was celebrated as a minister in World War I, the Viktória Cross.
His hometown celebrates the only Viktorian minister he received 100 years after he carried out his heroic act in World War I.
Honorable Bernard Vann and Colonel Colonel earned the award during the attacks on 29 September 1918 in Bellenglis and Leacourt.
Four days later, however, a sniper killed him, so he never knew he deserved the highest honor of the British armed forces.
Two grandkids of the memorial stone were exposed at the festival in Rushden, Northamptonshire, County.
One grandson, Michael Vann, said it was “symbolistic ” that the memorial stone was handed over exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s act of honor.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, honorable Bernard Vann and Colonel Colonel led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin Channel “in the middle of a dense mist or a heavy cannon and machine gunfire”.
Later, he rushed into the faceline, and with “exceptional heroism” he was at the forefront of the battalion, and then, alone, he rushed into a camp cannon squad, disposing of three of its members.
Colonel Bernard Vann shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
“I know I can never reach what my grandfather did, and this taught me humility,” said Michael Vann, 72 years old.
After the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were crowned as the memorial stone.
Michael Vann said it was an honor to be able to play a part in the ceremony and then added: “The fight of a true hero is evidenced by how many people later express their respect.”
The MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206, instead of Peppa pig.
Imagine that you've been up all night watching the exciting Bellator 206, and the transmission's missed.
The San José show featured 13 clashes, of which six were broadcast live nights as part of the main competition in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the British viewers were not surprised to see Peppa pig on the show instead of the game.
This was a problem for many who stayed up for hours in the morning because of this battle.
Instead of the MMA match, one of the fans labeled it "some sick joke" on Twitter.
“The public law states that such content can no longer be transmitted by channel at 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Bellator’s Communications and Marketing Department said.
- Yeah, that's Peppa, time for the pig."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, promised that in the future the schedule of the show would be revised to take into account the United Kingdom audiences.
“I think that by repeating, we can definitely solve this,” Coker said.
– However, since it is 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, until the Sunday of our time, which they already have on Monday, we cannot remedy the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show turned over, a lot of messages came in, and most of them weren't friendly.
At first we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix the error.
But that's not what it was. That's what we're dealing with. That's what we're dealing with.
But I can promise you that this will not happen the next time.
Instead of six, there will only be five matches in the program – we really wanted to please the viewers, but we counted ourselves.
It was an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had a minority complex due to his sexual orientation
Tom Daley at the jumping Olympics said that at a young age, he felt inferior to everyone because of his sexual orientation, but from that he was motivated to succeed.
According to the 24 - year - old athlete, he did not realize that “not everyone is like him. ”
In Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne told the broadcaster that he stood up for gay rights to give others hope.
He added that since he was a parent, he was much less interested in the Olympics.
The permanent broadcaster Kirsty Young, who lived for many years, missed several months because of the disease.
In Laverne's first show, Daley invited me as a shipwreck said that as a youth, he felt "less" than anyone else, because "it wasn't socially acceptable for someone to love boys and girls."
He said: “Today it is the feeling of inferiority and disparity that I draw strength and perseverance to achieve my success.”
He wanted to prove that he too was worth “thing ” so that he would not disappoint everyone when he discovered his sexual attitude.
The double Olympic bronze jumper has become a well-known representative of the LMBT community and has asked world governments to decriminate homosexuality in as many countries as possible by taking advantage of this year's national community games in Australia.
He said that he spoke because he felt lucky to have an open life without negative consequences and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that he was “absolutely surprised” when he fell in love with another man, Dustin Lance Black, who met for the first time in 2013.
Daley and his 20-year-old Oscar-winning screenwriter got married last year, and he claims that age difference was never a problem.
“If you go through so much at a young age,” he said – at 14 years of age you were at your first Olympics, and your father died of cancer three years later – then in your own age you find it hard to experience someone who had similar extreme experiences.
In June, he adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley.
“If you asked me that question last year, I would have said that the most important thing is to win a gold medal,” he said.
There are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal Robbie."
The child was named after Daley's father, Robert, who died in 2011, when he was 40 years old, after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
According to Daley's statement, his father refused to accept that he was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether he had the tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I was unable to answer him, ‘Dad, you will no longer be there in the first row,” he quoted.
“I touched his hand when his breathing stopped, but until that moment I couldn’t accept that my father was not invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I have noticed that this is what I have dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of the home audience at the Olympic Games, it feels no better,” he said.
He also drew inspiration to his first song. Heather Small Proud (Pull) was a great help to him in the preparation of the Olympics, and he still has goose skins if he hears it.
Desert Island Disc starts at 11:15 a.m. on Sunday at BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson wasn't in shape, and he was on a bench on Saturday at the Ryder Cup.
The American Phil Mickelson can set a record by participating in the 47th Cup game on Sunday, but you need to win his form back if you do not want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in your memory.
The Mickelson record is played for the 12th time at the two-yearly event, however, due to the performance of the four-ball and four-game games on Saturday, team captain Jim Furyk sent to the bench.
Instead of being at the heart of the events, five winners in the major races, as often as the United States had to fight for victory, now in one half of the day their team is hurling, spending the other half on the track and trying to correct the flaws that weaken their game.
At the top of his career he was never one of the most accurate bats, so the 48-year-old player does not really have the Le Golf National narrow track, where high grass costs a very high price for flawed punches.
And if the race alone isn't scary enough, Mickelson will be faced with the exact French champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who won all four of his games this week with the starting Tommy Fleetwood team.
If Americans who start with a four-point stake before the 12 individual matches start hard, Mickelson's game can be crucial.
Furyk claims he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
“He is fully aware of the role he played in today’s development. He beat my back, armed me and promised that he would be ready by tomorrow,” said Furyk.
- He's extremely confident.
He's one of the biggest, and he's done a lot for the team in the past and over the past week.
Basically, I didn't mean two games for him.
I was planning more, but in this situation, we decided to make the best of it.
He wants to be on the field like everyone else."
With Mickelson's Sunday performance, he's gonna beat Nick Faldo's record, and no one's ever played more games at the Ryder Cup.
With this, you can close a series on the Ryder Cup that is far behind the player's individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws for himself, but Furyk stressed that the presence of a veteran player has no tangible benefits for the team.
“It’s funny, sarcastic, witty, and likes to joke with others, a great team member,” he explained.
– I think that younger players also enjoyed the games against him, and this is good to see.
His presence goes beyond a game in a strict sense."
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, is aware that they can easily lose their advantage.
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if someone has a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup holding individual matches, happiness can easily turn their backs on him.
The Danish player was first presented in a 1997 Valderrama match, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros gained a five-point advantage against the Americans, and finally managed to keep a hairline for the 141⁄2-131⁄2 win.
“We must always remind ourselves that, in spite of our great advantage in Valderrama, we won only one piece of hair, and we also had a great advantage in Brookline, where we finally got out,” Bjørn said in the picture after the Friday and yesterday victory of the 2018 class 5-3, which will lead to 10-6 at Le Golf National.
– It is enough to think about the competitions of previous years, and everyone can already see that the game is not over.
Tomorrow you'll have to play with the full force.
So come on, and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the points are on the board.
We have a goal that is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to focus on.
As I said before, I mostly deal with the 12 players of our team, but we must also look to the other side, who happen to be one of the world's biggest players."
A proud Bjørn added: “I would never make predictions in such a situation.
Tomorrow's a very different pasta.
Then everything depends on individual performances, which is completely different from team play.
It's great to play in pairs when things are going well, but when you stand up individually, you'll find out in every respect what kind of golfer you really are.
That's what you and the players need to understand tomorrow is that you'll bring out the best in the field.
They must break off their partner, who will also have to bring the best form."
Contrary to Bjørn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opponent's team, strongly trusts that his players will perform better on an individual basis than in a couple, except for the doubles of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of the last day's resurrections: in Brookline he was a member of the winning team, and then he was on the losing side after the bravourous performance of the European team as a “Medinah miracle”.
“I remember every damn word,” he replied, “when they asked him, as he encouraged the players before the last day, team captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999.
– We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we have the best start as we have seen in Brookline, as we have seen in Medinah.
If one of the teams really comes in, it puts the opponent's players under enormous pressure during the mid-games.
We have prepared the order accordingly and prepared our players so that they can perform a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of putting the job at the forefront of the efforts to reverse and playing against Rory McIlroy in the first game, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the first half of the European team.
“I have also decided in favour of the order, because I believe that this is how the picture fits from the beginning to the end,” Bjørn added to the individual setting.
The transfer of Germany's latest warship has been postponed again
The German Navy's latest fregate should have been put in service in 2014 to replace the growing Cold War war ships, but due to various system failures and exponentially increasing costs, this will wait for you at least next year.
The launch of “Rheinland-Pfalz” was postponed to the first half of 2019 by the flagship of the branded fregates of the brand-new Baden-Württemberg class, the Die Zeit weekly, quoting an army spokesperson.
The ship was originally expected to join the Navy in 2014, but continuous delays made the fate of the large-scale project very difficult.
The Navy still ordered the four Baden-Württemberg class ships to replace the Bremen class's aging fregates in 2007.
We believe that it will be equipped with high-fire cannons and various anti-aircraft and watercraft missiles and camouflage technology, including an anti-signal device that reduces the ship's radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is the rare need for maintenance, which in practice means that these latest fregates can be served for up to two years away from mother ports.
However, due to the continuous slip of the project, these high-tech warships, with which Germany could feel its power overseas, could be obsolete when they were finally put on duty, noted Die Zei.
The heavy fregate F125 was placed on the front page last year, when the German Navy officially refused to launch the vehicle and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to the manufacturer.
The reasons for the return have not been given much information, but the German media refer to several critical “software and hardware faults” that make the warship useless on a military mission.
Software deficiencies are a very significant problem, as only 120 sailors will serve on the Baden-Württemberg class warships, which is only half the crew of the old Bremen class.
It has also become clear that the ship is extremely overweight, which undermines its performance and makes it impossible for the Navy to make further changes later.
The 7000-tonne ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ is said to be twice as difficult as the similar class ships that the Germans set up during World War II.
Apart from the flawed parts, the increase in the overall cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an amazing EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion), while the initial draft was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the new fregates are of particular importance in the light of the warnings that Germany's presence at sea is in decline.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's National Defence Committee, recently acknowledged that the Navy "has begun to run out of warships in good condition".
According to the civil servant, the problem has in the meantime become a self-absorbing process, since old ships had to be set up, but there are no more ships to replace the dropouts.
He expressed his concern that none of the fregates of Baden-Württemberg were even able to join the Navy bond.
National Trust is searching bats' secret lives
New research is being carried out on a Scottish-upland property designed to find out how bats use the features of the landscape while hunting.
Researchers hope that the results will provide new information on the behaviour of single flying mammals, which can also benefit future species conservation initiatives.
Scientists of National Trust for Scotland will examine the behaviour of common and soprano midwives and brown long-eared bats and water bats in the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices shall be placed at the appropriate points of the area in order to record the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will use manual detectors to collect mobile data.
A detailed analysis of the recordings can be used to determine the frequency of bat sounds and what the species is doing.
Researchers will also produce a habitat map and report that will help to determine in detail how animals behave according to the landscape.
Rob Dewar, an NTS nature consultant, hopes that the results will show what are the most important habitats for bats and how they are used by which species.
This information helps to identify the beneficial effects of habitat management work, such as the development of pastures, and how forest areas can best be preserved for bats and other relevant species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the size of bat populations has decreased significantly over the past century.
Buildings and land development work disrupt the animal’s sleep-places and reduce their living space.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also a risk factor for them, just as they are placed on fly paper, certain chemical procedures used for building materials, and attacks on domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their nightly predators, they rely much more on their hearing when they are hunting for prey than on their vision.
With their sophisticated techniques based on ultrasound reverberation, they can determine the exact location of insects as well as areas in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76 000 acres of land, takes the bats very seriously.
They work with ten qualified professionals, who regularly conduct studies and sleep-site examinations, and sometimes also participate in rescue work.
The organization has established the first and only dedicated bat reservation in Scotland in the area of Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten bat breeds in Scotland.
According to David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
“Here, in Three, bats have a great place,” he said.
– There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that is necessary for a good living space.
But we don't know much about bats yet, and thanks to the work done here and in other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel good."
He also stressed the importance of making sure that there are bats living there before the renovation of the buildings, as the destruction of a single site could result in the destruction of 400 female and young individuals, which could lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals, their destruction, harassment, and alienation are prohibited by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, also asked for the help of the population.
He said: “There is still much we do not know about bats, and we have almost no information about the situation of the population of most Hungarian species.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges, his lawyers are suing the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the charges of sexual violence against him “falsive news”. He felt that others wanted to use his name to “get in the public knowledge”.
His football attorneys are ready to sue the German weekly of charges, Der Spiegel.
A member of the Portuguese framework and the Juventus battle were accused of rapeing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the woman, the athlete paid her $375 000 to listen to the case, written by Der Spiegel on Friday.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo announced a few hours after the charges were brought to light in a Instagram Live video with 142 million fans that the news was "a lie".
‘No, no, no, no and no.
What's been carried away today is all a lie," said the camera's five-time goldball player.
“They want to use my name to get into public awareness.
It happens.
They want to become famous with my name, that's the life of the publicists.
I'm a happy man, and my life is fine," the player added with a smile.
Because of the claims that were called “unacceptable, a suspicion of privacy,” Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, says Reuters.
According to a lawyer Christian Schertz, the player will file a claim for compensation “for moral damage caused to the extent that the infringement is serious, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights committed in recent years.”
The case was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in one of the suites of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went up to the sportsman's suite, where the man analysed a woman, stands in the papers submitted to the state's attorney's office in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him that he was a “99 percent good boy” except for “one percent”.
Based on the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo admitted to having sexual relations with the woman, but he felt that this was done with a common consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police, and in a hospital she also prepared a report on her injuries, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “afraid of retaliation" and "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman would like to repeal the agreement now, as the trauma in this case continues to make her life miserable.
Ronaldo was just before the transfer (from Real Madrid to Manchester United) at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer the Italian giant, Juve, bought the player for 100 million euros.
Brexit: the United Kingdom will "treatment forever" the loss of car factories
The United Kingdom "will regret it forever" if, after Brexit, it loses its leading car manufacturer position," said Greg Clark, Minister of Enterprise.
Then he added: “I am concerned” by the statement given by the UK to the BBC, which states that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, then the car factory will have to temporarily stop production in the Burnastonian factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
According to the Japanese car manufacturer, jobs may be lost due to delays at the borders in the case of a non-agreed Brexit.
Last year, the Burnastonian factory, which manufactured the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150 000 cars, 90% of which were exported to other Member States of the European Union.
“I think that if the United Kingdom falls out of the EU at the end of March, production stops will take place in the factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Executive Director of Toyota Burnastoni.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) expressed concerns about the possibility of the country leaving the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW stated that after Brexit it would shut down Miniket’s company in Oxford for a month.
Car manufacturers are most concerned about the risk of a non-agreed Brexit in the supply chain.
The Toyota production line operates on a “super-time” basis and parts come every 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the United Kingdom and other EU Member States.
If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without agreement on 29 March, the cross-border disruptions, according to industry representatives, can lead to production delays and spare parts.
According to Toyota, it would be impossible to store more than a day’s spare parts at its plant in Derbyshire, and production should therefore be stopped.
Clark said that the plan for future relations with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, "is designed precisely to avoid delays at the border."
“We need an agreement. We want an agreement under the best possible conditions, not only to enjoy the fruits of our current successes, but also to offer new opportunities,” said BBC Radio 4 Today.
– Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers can confirm that we definitely need to maintain our very successful supply chain at the moment."
Toyota could not tell how long production would last, but it warned that the added-up costs could damage the factory’s competitiveness in the long term, which could eventually lead to job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked 24 years at the Burnastonian factory and is currently active in the union of Unite, the union members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, the jobs that have ceased at this time will never be returned.”
One government spokesperson said: "We have developed a direct and feasible plan for future EU relations."
They can postpone Trump and Rosenstein's meeting again, said the White House
"They can postpone another week", Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump's large-scale meeting as Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court candidate continues to be debated, announced on Sunday in the White House.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the influence of the elections, the possible relations between Trump's advisors and the Russian government, and the possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
In Washington, for months, it's been assumed that Trump would eventually lose the deputy D.A.'s office, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence.
According to this monthly report by the New York Times, Rosenstein considered that he would arrive wired to the meeting to record his conversation with the president, and the question was whether the 25th amendment would allow Trump to be replaced.
Rosenstein denied what he said.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, and the rumor was to present his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then in front of the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would be “unappropriatingly” to go to Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that he would not conflict with the Senate Committee on Justice, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who suspected him of sexual sin, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh, with which the final Senate vote was postponed.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made a visit to Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he replied: “We don’t have a designated date yet, or we can set it for this week, but in the light of the Supreme Court cases, I see another one - week delay.
It'll soon find out, and I'll, as always, let the press know."
However, some journalists expressed their dissatisfaction with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Director Chris Wallace also asked me why.
Sanders replied that the reason why the rareness of press conferences was not the reaction of television reporters to the behaviour of a “sensitizer” but he added: “I do not dispute the fact that they are really a “sensitizer.”
He then indicated that direct meetings between Trump and the press would be more frequent.
“The President is interviewing more questions than any previous president,” he added. He added, without supporting the claim: “We looked after the numbers.”
Press conferences will continue, said Sanders, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask directly the President of the United States, it is better to talk to me with light - years.
We often try to do this, and there have been a number of such events in the last few weeks, so they can speak to the President of the United States in person instead of the White House press conferences."
Trump regularly answers reporters' questions when he leaves the White House or attends public events or perhaps press conferences with visiting dignitys.
However, the press conferences held alone are rare.
Why, perhaps, can be concluded from what happened this week when the president produced a strange and sometimes bizarre role in New York in front of the gathered journalists.
The head of the health wallet addressed concerns about Brexit to EU workers in NHS Scotland
The head of the health wallet expressed the country's gratitude in a letter to the employees of the Scottish NHS from the countries of the European Union and stressed that he hoped they would remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom was expected to leave.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of EU citizens working in decentralised public services’ applications for status.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations on exit between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued, which are expected to result in a decision in the autumn.
The United Kingdom Government also contributed to the preparation of a possible non-agreed scenario.
I'm aware of what a disturbing period this could be for you.
That is why I would like to emphasise once again how much I appreciate the efforts made by each member of the team, regardless of the country they come from.

Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after he had a head injury.
At the Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, an emergency surgery was carried out after a head injury was reported by Mike Organ Tennessee in the 31-27 match against the Vanderbilt Commodores team on Saturday.
The head coach of the Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the damage occurred shortly before the middle of the day.
“He walked out to the coastline and just collapsed,” said Reed.
The coaching team and the health staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the track, then put it on a stretcher and took it for further tests.
One of Tennessee State's officials in Nashville, Tennessee, told Chris Harris, a WSMV reporter, that Abercrombie was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “for the time being, he does not know more details about the type and extent of the injury” while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a one-year-old student, spends her first season at Tennessee State's team, where she's been certified from Illinois.
On Saturday, he presented a total of five successful installations before leaving the course, so he's at 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes on property purchased in the United Kingdom
According to Toryk's new plan, foreign customers will have to pay higher taxes on property purchased in the United Kingdom and, with the resulting additional income, they would support the homeless.
This step would neutralise the success of Corbyn among young voters.
The increase of the levy is aimed at those who are not taxing in the United Kingdom
According to the Treasury, this would amount to GBP 120 million per year to support the homeless.
Foreign customers will have to pay higher taxes on property purchased in the UK, and the resulting surplus income will be used to support the homeless, and will be announced at a press conference today.
The aim of the action is likely to be to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn among young voters by promising more affordable housing and measures aimed at high-income people.
The increase in the levy will affect individuals and companies who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, and the resulting surplus revenue will be used to combat homelessness.
The additional charge to be added to the current levy, which is to be calculated in addition to the higher charge on second dwellings and buildings purchased for expenditure two years ago, may amount to up to three per cent.
As a result of the measure, the Treasury expects a revenue of GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by citizens outside the United Kingdom, causing a significant price increase, resulting in an increasingly difficult situation for the first apartment purchasers.
Many of the rich districts of the country have become a “spirit city,” especially in the capital, as there are many foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill arrived just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the fees to help young people prepare to wait for their first home.
He personally believes that the construction companies are responsible for keeping the real estate prices high, who have become a habit of buying up and leaving the land in the Parliament. He asked May to delete the quotas for affordable houses and start something with the country's "hospital shame".
Corbyn announced remarkable proposals for a series of housing reforms, including the abolition of rent checks and unsubstantiated evictions.
It would also provide more powers and opportunities for councils to build new houses.
May said: “Also I said that I wanted to devote my prime minister to the restoration of the English dream and that life would be better for every generation.
In addition, the real estate market situation needs to be resolved.
Britain remains, as always, open to those who wish to live, work and establish a family here.
However, it is not right for private individuals living outside the country and foreign-interested companies to be able to purchase real estate as easily as the hard-working English citizens.
Dreams from their own homes have become almost inaccessible to too many people, and the unfair state of homelessness has become too accessible."
Jack Ross: "I want to be the head of the Scottish team."
Jack Ross, Sunderland's coach's statement is that he's going to be the head of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would like to take up the challenges of raising the North-East Club, which is currently in the third position of the first class league, with only three points behind the first position.
He then transferred his seat to the stadium named Stadium of Light, after successful return of St. Mirren's team to the first-class Scottish football tournament in the previous season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a playwright too.
Unfortunately, however, I only managed to get into the reserve room,” said Ross in his show "BBC Sportsound".
– When I was a kid, I watched a lot of the Scottish team play in Hampden with my father, and something always pulled me back to them.
But now I have only a chance to succeed as a club manager."
There's Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic is not concerned that he needs to follow up on such great names and previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's offer.
“I will be measuring the success right now to see if I can get the team back to first class.
If we take the structure and facilities of the club, it is undoubtedly the place of the first-class league,” he said.
– It will not be easy to get back, but more than likely, I will only consider my activity here a success if the club can be returned."
Ross's career as a manager began only three years ago, after being a deputy coach at the Dumbarton team for a while, and spent 15 months in the Hearts Coach's Guard.
Then he helped Aolla get back on her feet after the team went back to the third class and got the championship title with St. Mirren on the verge of the fall in the next season.
Ross claims to feel more confident now than ever in his career, whether in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academic.
“It was a crucial moment,” she recalled.
– I clearly thought that management was more for me than being a player.
That sounds weird, because I've done well, and I've had quite a good life of it, and I've had a few really memorable moments.
The lives of players, however, are sometimes very hard.
There's a lot to go through every single week.
Of course, I must continue to cope with the stress and pressure of the work, but the management tasks lie with me.
I've always been interested in management, and now that I've tasted it, I feel the most in my skin right now when I was a grown-up."
The full interview will be broadcast on the Radio Scotland channel on Sunday, 30 September, from 12:00 to 13:00 local time.
According to a study, Saturday afternoon at 5:30, beer is the best thing to do.
In the summer heat wave, the traffic of hardship pubs in England has increased considerably, but food chains are still under pressure.
According to the data collected, revenue from pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, an employee of the CGA Business Advisory Company that compiled statistics, stated: “Thanks to the sunny period and the longer-than-awaited world championship role in England, the trend of the previous month continued in July, when pubs experienced an increase of 2.8% in revenue, with the difference being that there could be an even greater decline in the number of restaurants.
The reduction in the income of restaurants by 1.8% in June has further deteriorated in July.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol mostly did the best to produce growth even more than the loss of restaurants.
Rather, the food pubs were affected by the long-lasting sun, although not nearly as dramatic as the operators of restaurants.
It seems that people prefer to drink at this hour.
The revenue from drinks from pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% this month and the revenue from food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, a leisure and catering RSM analyst, said: “These results follow the trend that has been being outlined since the end of April.
Weather, as well as major social and sporting events continue to be the main income factor in the entertainment and catering industry.
It is not surprising that the food chains are in a difficult situation and the annual reduction in revenue of 4.8% can be particularly painful due to the constant cost pressure.
It could not have been worse for a long, hot summer for restaurant operators, and it will only be possible to find out in time whether the moderater weather in August will ease this area as well."
The total increase in revenue from pubs and restaurants was 2.7% in July, including newly opened places, which reflects the slow pace of the introduction of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales of the catering sector (pubs, bars and restaurants) in the United Kingdom and is a widely accepted industrial scale, collects and analyses the performance data of a 47-member group of operators with a total turnover of more than 9 billion.
One in five children has social media accounts that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children (up to 11 years old) have social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of "Insta-subpages" is increasing.
The news increases the fear of sharing sexual content
20% of the students replied that there is a “head” account that their parents can see
One out of five children (up to 11 years of age) create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of "Insta self-accounts" is rapidly increasing, which refers to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news increases the fear of sharing sexual content.
20% of the students replied that they have an immaculate “head” account that their parents can see, but also create private accounts.
A mother who accidentally discovered the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage profile that said "rape me."
According to a study carried out by Headmasters ’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), which represents the directors and directors of independent schools, 40 % of the 11-18-year-olds have two profiles and 50% have recognised that they have private accounts.
“I find it worrying that so many teenagers feel that they need to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot reach them,” said HMC’s leader, Mike Buchanan.
Elidh Doyle will be the voice of athletes in the Scottish Athletics Association
Elidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Association at the annual meeting of the Management Board.
Doyle's most successful athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, the chairman of the board, said that the decision-makers of sport will be invaluable aid from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Elidh is greatly respected in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the international athletic community, and its presence will help the development of Scottish athletics,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am happy to be the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can really help the work of Scottish sports leaders.”
Two of the four Olympic gold medals of the American athletes who regularly declared to be experts at the BBC were awarded at the Atlantic Olympics in 1996 at 200 m and 400 m, but due to a temporary brain circulatory disorder, he was forced into a wheelchair.
He wrote on his Twitter page: “I got a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me if I'd ever come back.
I'm working with a man, but I've managed to recover completely, I can walk again, I'm going to agility practice today!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages."
A breast - sucking ad that resembles mothers cows shares the online community
There was an intense online debate on the advertising of a breast - feeding company that compared breast - feeding mothers to cows.
Elvie claims to have developed “the world’s first quiet, portable breasts,” and that the appearance of their products was advertised in an ironic commercial record of music videos, which showed what freedom the device gives to milk-sucking mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cowhouse full of straw, while in the background the song that follows the following lines can be heard: “Yes, I think myself, I don’t even have a tail” and “if I hadn’t noticed, they’re not shoes, but my breasts.”
And the Friday sounds like, "I'm pumping, pumping, making the kid eat big, pumping, pumping, banging, banging girls."
An ad published on the Facebook page of the company was quickly crucified by online disputes.
The video has reached 77 000 views and has received hundreds of comments indicating mixed receptions. Many say advertising makes fun of the dairy industry’s “horrors.”
“It is very tasteless to promote the product with cows.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only if they give life, but their calves are taken away from them within days," one commenter recalls.
The Elvie breast-feeding can be discreetly placed in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother )
Another comment was: “Yes, it is terrible for the mother and for the calf.
But why not use them to sell breasts to mothers who can keep their children?"
Someone else added, “A full-sensible ad.”
Others came to protect me from advertising, a woman admitted that she thought the video was "very funny."
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I would've bought it if I still had breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a crazy commercial, so I don't even try to see it anymore.
The product is brilliant," he wrote.
According to another comment, “This is a funny ad at work or in a toilet for milk - making mothers who feel like cows for it.
It does not praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that during the dance they had the discreet breasts in their bra.
The campaign is building on the feeling that women who use breast-sucking sometimes feel like cows.
Elvie Pump is quiet, does not use wires and pipes, can be discreetly placed in a breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their children in hand, or even move out of breast-feeding.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and communication director of Mother, said: “Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product and therefore had to be declared bold, provocatively.
We wanted to draw attention to the parallelness between women with milk and herds, to the challenges of using breasts, and to the funny way in which our breasts provide freedom in comparison with this."
Elvie's breast-sucking isn't the first time she's been on the news.
At London’s Fashion Week, Marta Jakubowski, a two - child mother, stepped into the runway while using the product.
Hundreds of child-aged migrants were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of child-age migrants in custody has reached a record, while the number of monthly border crossings has not changed much. This can partly be explained by the fact that it is difficult to find host homes for them due to the harsh rhetoric of Trump administration and its measures so far.
It is typically illegal immigrants themselves, and they fear that they would worsen their chances of staying in the country if they applied for the adoption of children.
This threat increased further in June when it was announced that parents applying for admission and adults living with them should give fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, senior official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in his statement to Congress last week, admitted that dozens of people were arrested who applied for the reception of unaccompanied minors.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of the detainees were unpunished.
“80% of those applying to the host and those living with them are illegally staying in the country and a significant proportion are convicted of crime.
Therefore, we will continue to search for such individuals," said Albence.
In order to speed up the procedure for children, new rules have been introduced whereby a part of them must appear before the courts within one month of their arrest instead of 60 days so far, says the social workers.
A lot of people check in through a video conference call in court instead of personal appearances to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge does not grant legal protection, the immigrant is quickly deported.
In recent months, social workers and workers in the system have reported that the longer it takes for children to be arrested, the more nervous and depressed they become, and the more violent outbreaks or attempts to escape.
According to lawyers, these risks are only increased by a larger facility such as its towers, where the number of children makes it difficult to filter those in need of psychological care difficult.
They added that if they did not give the children enough time to prepare themselves or to say goodbye to friends before being transferred to such a facility, they would be even more traumatized.
Syria called on the American, French and Turkish ‘invading forces’ to leave immediately
In spite of the civil war that took place in the country for the eighth year, the Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem, who spoke before the UN General Assembly, asked Syrian refugees to return to their country.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign troops have unlawfully entered the Syrian territory on the basis of the fight against terrorism, and "will treat them this way."
“They must withdraw, however and unconditionally,” said the Assembly.
Moualem stated that “the war against terror will soon end” in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He declared that Damascus “continues his holy struggle to purify the entire territory of Syria” from terrorist groups and “the illegal presence of a foreign country.”
2000 U.S. soldiers are present in Syria, most of them as trainers and advisors help the Kurdish forces and the Arab militias fighting against Bassar el-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 soldiers to the country affected by the war.
With regard to refugees, Moualem claimed that the conditions were appropriate for their return and that only “some Western countries” were driving the “irrational fears”, alarming refugees from returning home.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help the return of the population,” he said.
– They made politics out of a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Azerbaijan and its opposition on the end of the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which will create a conflict between the last great insurgency of the rebels around Idlib, can facilitate further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented the Syrian government forces supported by the Russians from launching a large-scale attack on the province of three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement set clear deadlines and expressed the hope that military action would only be directed against jihadists, including An-Nuszra Front linked to Al-Qaida, which "must be eliminated."
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee of government and opposition delegates will soon be able to be convened with the task of preparing the post-war Syrian constitution and preparing the elections.
Among the conditions in Moulem, the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, for example, only "reviewing certain articles of the current constitution", is acceptable and warns all external actors from being involved in the process.
That's why they're gonna re-choose Trump.
Following this logic, Trumpo will certainly be re-elected in 2020, unless the hopes of many liberal viewers come true, and a process of responsibly or a scandal will not end its presidency in time.
We can be sure that this would be "the most dramatic presidential final of all time."
For now, however, the audience is enjoying the show.
Since 2014, CNN's main programme watch has grown to almost doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled its view to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen's data, Fox News attracts on average 2.4 million viewers in the main show time instead of 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show at MSNBC is the most watched cable TV show with its 3.5 million audience, which will be achieved on the evenings of the most significant news.
“He attracts us like fire, because something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the leading producer of the ABC’s drama series entitled “The Nominal Survivor”. In this series, the cabinet sits in a low-ranking chair after the capital dies in an attack.
Nell Scovell Veteran comedy writer, “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” thinks differently.
In this way, he recalls a boston taxi trip before the 2016 election:
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
“Why” he asked Scovell.
"Because it makes me laugh," the driver replied.
It's a force of chaos.
Of course, unlike television shows, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases like Roe vs. Wade-precedence, whether immigrant families can reunite and the stability of the world economy.
There's only one very narrow layer of it that can do it so you don't care about these facts.
However, it is no longer part of the responsible information when we have been staring at a debate show for the sixth hour, which is about the authenticity of the anonymous background conversations used in Bob Woodward's book "Fear", or about the consequences of Paul Manafor's 15 thousand dollar oscillating jacket (the clothing of the body's arrogantness, as The Washington Post puts it), or of his description of Stormy Daniels Trump's anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, that's what I'll always think about Super Mario from now on.
“You feel a little like watching a reality show, where you get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, the creator of the “Walking Stars”. In Trump’s show, players are constantly changing and new turns are coming on a daily basis (such as N.F.L., Kim Jsongunt starts to praise).
If you miss one part, you'll miss it.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a pleasant, 26-degree, sunny time in Kauai, yet he was in his house waving about MSNBC while recording CNN's show.
He couldn't break off the TV as Brett Kavanaugh began his hearing in the Senate Justice Committee, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was at stake.
“I remember when we produced those crazy shows, ” Fleiss recalled, “that was the beginning of the end for Western civilization.
I thought they were just kidding, but they seem to be right."

Both parties pour money into the tightest competitions of the half-time congressional election
No one was surprised that both parties in the 17th constituencies of Pennsylvania spend the money uncounted, after two active representatives have fought for the same chair after the drawing of the congress districts.
One of the competitions for the recently redecorated suburbs of Pittsburgh is the Democratic Conor Lamb, who won a mandate in an interim election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, the Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently a representative of the former 12 constituencies of Pennsylvania, which shows a significant overlap with today's 17th district.
The map had to be revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held in January that the former borders were manipulated to the benefit of the Republicans.
In the fight for the 17th district, the funding body of the two parties, the Democratic Campaign Conventional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), were almost bids on each other during the campaign.
Lamb’s name became known in Pennsylvania after he won the mid-term election of March in the 18th Congress district of Pennsylvania.
For more than a decade, his seat was owned by the Republicans, and Donald Trump won the district with 20 exact advantages.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a better chance of winning.
The United States has considered sanctions against El Salvador for support from China and then abandoned the plan.
According to the diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama were already on the side of Beijing, which Washington hardly responded to.
Donald Trump was in a good mood with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until his partners forced Trump Organization's leadership team out of there.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called back the US headquarters' main staff from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of their "recent decision not to support Taiwan" earlier announced Heather Nauer, the Ministry's spokesperson.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received approximately USD 140 million in US aid in 2017, including the fight against drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have had a painful impact on the Central American country, where the unemployment and murder rates are also extremely high.
As the closed meetings continued, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been a continuation of a similar meeting last year, with the primary aim of reducing migration to the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of administration made it clear that I would like to hold a conference, which clearly indicated that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
It has been announced that Vice-President Mike Pence will speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October, which according to diplomats is a clear indication of how important the administration considers the event to be.
The three U.S. delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue convictions and did not take criminal action.
John Bolton's White House spokesperson did not wish to comment on the details of the debate, which were reported anonymously by three US officials, including two diplomats.
Their reporters were also supported by external analysts close to administration, who were also willing to speak anonymously.
Historical Experience
The next strike could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who's investigating whether Trump was in any way hindering justice... and that's what a number of facts have been made public.
Mueller's investigation has also been reported to include whether Trump's team has cooperated with Russia, which is trying to influence the elections.
If the Democrats are in the majority of Congress, they will certainly try to bring Trump to account, who, after the voters, may have to face the judgment of his fellow politicians.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertain questions, and the fall of Trump is far from inevitable... as is the case with European friends.
Serious decisions need to be taken on both sides of the Atlantic – depending on how long the fight will last.
In 1938 a number of German officers were ready to poke Hitler, only waiting for the West to stand next to the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
The aid was delayed, so it was not possible to prevent the bloodshed of the next few years.
It is at historical turning points such as this that the inevitable development of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
In today's America, we can identify several of these turning points.
What are we going to do if Trump replaces Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's chair has been agitating since last year, when, as our newspaper has reported on it, he suggested that the discussions with the president be recorded, and he said that Trump's inappropriate office should be filled.
Rosenstein said The Times was inaccurate about the events.
“How will we react if the F.B.I. investigation against Brett Kavanaugh becomes biased or incomplete and is appointed as a member of the Supreme Court despite a sexual harassment charge that appears credible?
And the most important question is that we vote in the interim election for a Congress that is ready to take responsibility for Trump?
If we fail these trials, democracy will face a long winter.
I trust it won't, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once served as an ambassador in my home.
My mother survived the holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later asked me to light candles on the table bearing the sign of the swastika during the Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how can I be a pessimist about our future?"

Graham Dorrans at the Rangers is confident before the Rapid Wien game
The Rangers will receive Rapid Wien on Thursday. The victory against the Austrians can provide them with participation in Group G of the European League after an unexpected tie against Spanish Villarreal.
Due to Graham Dorrans' knee injury, he was unable to enter the course in the season until the 2-2 match against Villarreal, but he feels that building on this result, the Rangers can also set more bold goals for himself.
“There was a significant point against a great team, Villarreal,” said the 31-year-old player.
– We believed that we could score, and we brought a point.
Maybe we could have scored another goal at the end, but we can't complain about the final.
They were better in the first half, and we connected them in the second half.
Thursday will be another important European game.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy, because they were pretty good at their previous game, but with our fans behind our backs, we'll definitely have the power to win.
Last year was a tough year, I was hurt, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
We have a good team, the guys enjoy the game, the training's good.
I hope that if we give it all, we can leave behind the previous season and achieve good results."
A lot of women worry about not saving enough money for their old age.
Those involved in the survey had precise ideas about what old age care they wanted, but only a small part of it talked to their family members.
According to the Nationalwide survey, only half of the respondents discussed with their spouse the expected costs of their old-age care.
Only 10% of them responded by talking to their children about it.
“Everybody wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t usually raise the subject,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationalwide Life Insurance.
The following should be done.
First, discuss the question with your spouse and children: You cannot expect them to take proper care of you if you do not tell them what your needs are.
Together with the consultant and family, they choose where and what they want to be provided; these decisions will have a significant impact on later costs.
Enter a financial advisor: he can provide useful ideas on how to pay for the planned benefits.
Funding can be made with a traditional insurance policy designed for old-age care or a hybrid savings insurance policy that can cover expenses or use its own assets as a hedge... if there is sufficient resources to cover it.
Prepare the legal documentation: This will pre-empt the possibility of further litigation.
Trust a representative, a reliable person who acts on your behalf on health issues, supervises your medical care and ensures that everything is done according to your expectations even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone to handle your finances.
This reliable person makes the necessary financial decisions and provides for the payment of accounts when you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the small details: Let’s say that your elderly parents are in a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer your questions about your medicine and your allergies?
Such data shall be recorded in writing to be available at any time.
“It is not just the financial issues that need to be clarified, it is no matter who your doctor is,” Martin added.
“What medicines do you take?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Everything must be planned in advance."
A man was shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he was on his way home after his evening program.
The victim in his 40s was attacked in the Ilfracom, Devon, in an area called Oxford Grove, in his chest, abdomen, and hand.
The police described the shooting around 10:30 local time as an “intelligible act”.
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and floods in Indonesia
At least 384 people lost their lives when a major earthquake struck the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, and the authorities said that the number of victims could continue to increase.
The communications network in the area was also damaged, so no news has yet come from the Governorate Dongala, north of Pau, where it was the centre of the 7.5-thousand earthquake.
More than 16,000 inhabitants had to be evacuated.
Some important information is available on the island of Celebes from Palau and Donggala:
The capital of the Central Celebesz Province, on the west coast of Celebesz Island, was built at the end of a narrow bay, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
He was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the city’s foundation when the earthquake and the flood struck him.
Governor Donggala is located more than 300 km away on the northwestern coast of Celebes Island.
In 2017, the population of the government, smaller than the province, was around 299 200.
Central Celebes is mainly characterised by fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is an important sector of the economy, but mainly in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, Palut and Donggala have suffered a number of outbreaks in the last 100 years.
A 1938 fountain killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, West Donggala was hit by an escape price, and nine died.
Indonesia is situated in the geographically active Pacific Fire Ring, therefore earthquakes are common.
Only a few of the major earthquakes and floods of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a massive seaquake began on the west coast of the province of Aceh, northern Somalia, which launched an escape from 14 countries, which claimed a total of 226 000 lives along the Indian Ocean coastline, with more than half of the victims losing their lives in Aceh.

Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, former Governor of Sarah Palin, and vice president of Alaska, were arrested for assault.
The 29-year-old Palin lives in Wasilla, Alaska, and is suspected of committing domestic violence, hindering domestic violence, and resisting arrest, and protesting the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a lady's witness tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in a pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su, and a $500 bail has been imposed on him, reported by the KUTU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday and answered the question of his guilt, “not guilty at all. ”
Palin is charged with three Class A violations, i.e. a maximum of four years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
In addition, he is accused of a Class B violation, which may result in a one-day detention and a fine of $2,000.
Palin's not going to be in conflict with the law for the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
Your mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged attack on the police.
The case is currently under discussion by the Alaskan Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence and of preventing the reporting of a crime, as well as of possession of weapons under alcoholic influence in connection with the case.
His girlfriend at the time said he hit him in the face.
Sarah Palint was criticised in 2016 by several veteran organisations when her son attributed his behaviour to post-traumatic stress resulting from the Iraqi service.
Earthquake and flood in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384 people lost their lives after a Friday earthquake on the island of Celebes, Indonesia.
The 7.5-strength earthquake has created an earthquake that has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and telecommunications systems have become inoperative, and the number of dead is likely to increase in the next few days.
The centre of the earthquake was near Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
In social media, there were several videos about the arrival of the escape price.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the shore of Pau, when the flood reached the shore.
The U.S. Attorneys have ordered a death penalty on the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City.
The U.S. Attorneys of New York are asking for a death penalty on Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the eight-man-life terrorist attack in New York City, which has not been executed in the state since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov was accused of driving on a bicycle ride from Home Depot in October on the street of West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, gasting a number of pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to prove the legality of the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed eight of his victims “intentionally” and “on purpose” to cause injury, stands in the case of the DA’s office in the South District of New York.
According to the file submitted, proof of any of the two charges may justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with 22 crimes, including eight-order rapes, which were used almost exclusively to combat organised crime and the destruction and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack "needed significant planning and a deliberate intention", claims the prosecutors, and Saipov said he did it in a "serious, cruel, inhumane" way.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused pain and loss for the family of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” says.
Five victims from Argentina were tourists.
The southern district of New York last requested death penalty for a defendant a decade ago.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
In a federal case in New York, the last death sentence was executed in 1953, and in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the couple was sentenced two years earlier for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court records, U.S.A. Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, has shown no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
During the interviews, he claimed that he was pleased to have done so.
Saipov said that the ISIS videos he was watching on his phone gave him the idea of attacking him, they're indicted.
According to the police, he asked them to put out an ISIS asset in his hospital room.
In all 22 charges, you've proven yourself innocent.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s state defenders, said that they were “obviously disappointed” by the decision of the prosecutors.
“In our opinion, the actual death penalty for a confession would have been more favourable, and the death penalty only prolongs the suffering of all the actors involved in the case,” says Patton.
Saipov's defenses used to ask the prosecutors not to apply for a death penalty for their defenses.
A Tory said that Nigel FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations.
In a demonstration at the Tory Conference, Nigel Farage stated that he would “call the army of the people into battle. ”
According to Ukip's former leader, politicians need to feel the pressure of Eurosceptics after one of Theresa May's party members has argued that Farage should be entrusted with negotiations with the EU.
The conservative Peter Bone, who did not fill any office, told the participants in the Birmingham meeting that the United Kingdom would have ‘has left long ago’ if Farage were the Brexit Minister.
It is a good example of the pressure within the party that may be heavy on May that the Toryk of the Ice Party spoke at another protest against Brexit in the city.
May is trying to implement the Chequers plan, which requires permanent bouncing between Brexit and the remaining parties and the EU.
According to his allies, despite the negative reactions, he is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels so that Eurosceptics and Labour can only choose from his package or from his “total chaos”.
Bone said at the demonstration of Leave Means Leave in Solihull ("The exit means we quit") that the "Chequers-alku" should be deducted.
The suggestion was that Farage should be brought into the House of Lords and be entrusted with negotiating with Brussels.
"If he were to lead the negotiations, we would have left," he said.
The wellingborough Member added: “I stand by Brexit, but the Chequers-alku has to be deducted.”
Criticizing the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be servants of others.
We want to make our own country's laws."
Bone rejected the assumption that, since the vote in 2016, there was a change of opinion: “There is no real reason for the British people to change their opinion and to stay.”
Andrea Jenkins, Brexit Tory, also attended the meeting and told the journalists: “All I ask is: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the word of the people.
The Chequers deal is rejected by the public, the opposition will not vote, the party membership is unpopular, and especially among the activists who work in the field and helped us get to the government.
Forget the Chequers deal and listen to us."
He added: “Only the Prime Minister who keeps his word can keep his seat.”
Farage said at the meeting that politicians should "feel pressure" so that they would not dare to betray the outcome of the 2016 referendum.
“Trust between us, that is, between the people and our politicians, is now at stake,” he said.
– They want to betray Brexit, and today we're gathered to send a message, we won't let them do it."
He turned to the enthusiastic crowd with these words: “I would like our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, to feel pressure.
We call the army of the people to battle with Brexit, and we will not rest until we make the United Kingdom a independent, independent, proud country again."
In the meantime, the remaining parties marched to Birmingham and held a two - hour meeting in the city center.
Some activists flew the flag of the "Tories against Brexit" movement this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party has been agitated in the conservatives for the purpose of the party due to security errors at the opening of the conference.
“These people said that they had an IT background for a Canada-plus agreement, a border crossing without a problem and a free trade agreement with Ireland without borders,” he added.
- They're just talking next door.
There is simply no good Brexit," he emphasised.
Warren "considers carefully" to run for the presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that, after the November election, she would carefully consider running for the presidency.
According to the Boston Globe report, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday at a Western Massachusetts Public Forum.
Warren, who is the regular critic of Donald Trump, is preparing for a reelection in November against the Republican representative of the State, Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massuchusetts campaign.
For some time now, there have been assumptions that he might be the one who will be able to replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been held in the framework of the 36th Population Forum with voters since Trump took office.
A participant asked if he was planning to go to the presidential election.
In his reply, Warren said that the time had come for "women to play a role in restoring the misguided government in Washington, including taking the highest position".
They arrested the person suspected of shooting Sims in LSU
Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that the person suspected of killing Wayde Sims, a basketball player in LSU, was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. on the east coast time.
A video of the shooting on Friday was previously released, and they asked for help in identifying the man on the tape.
The 20-year-old Simst was shot dead on Friday early in the morning near the University of Southern University.
“Wayde Sims suffered head trauma from the shooting, which proved fatal,” Commissioner Murphy J. Paul briefed the media representatives on Saturday according to the 247sports report.
He intervened in defense of Wayde's friend, that's when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the interrogation that he was on the scene, had a gun at him, and he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson's arrest took place without an incident, and the man was arrested at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
At Baton Rouge, he was an adult, almost two-metre-high Sims played 32 games in the past season, played 10 as a starting point, played on average 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 downs.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton got closer to the world championship, after the team leaders won the victory before Sebastian Vettel
Once Valtteri Bottas qualified himself for a better place than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear immediately that the instructions of the Mercedes team will play a major role in my race.
Bottas, starting from a no-position position, began well and almost got Hamilton in trouble because he defended his position in the first two rounds, which allowed Vettel to attack his teammate.
First he stood in the box with Vet and let Hamilton get stuck in traffic behind the middle field, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes stood out a round later, and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came forward after a close action, during which Ferrari's pilot refused to release the inner curve after he had moved twice as a defense in the third turn.
The 21st birthday celebrater Max Verstappen started from the rear row of the starting blocks, and by the end of the first round he was the seventh.
He then drove most of the race because he didn't change tires so he could reach the finish line quickly and beat Kimi Räikkönen in the hope of the fourth place.
Finally, in the 44th round he stood in the box, but in the eight remaining circles he was unable to increase his pace, so Räikköne became the fourth place.
“It was a week, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman when he was instructed to let me go.
The team achieved exceptional work to get the first two seats," said Hamilton.
His body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday because the senator insisted that he did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter to accuse Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment as a new member of the Supreme Court.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to Ford's testimony made before the Senate's Justice Committee, but he noted that things in the Senate prove that people are "mute, hateful, and liars".
“What can happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days, when they see anger when they see people angry, mean, hateful and lying,” he said.
“If we look at the declarations and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
It wasn’t me.”
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document? “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not leak.”
Well, wait a minute.
We leaked?...No, we didn't leak," he added, mimicking the senator.
The letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and the letter leaked out early in September. Feinstein denied that the source of the leak would be his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims and leak his story,” said Feinstein to the committee according to The Hill’s report.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential according to his request."
However, it seems that his denial was not accepted by the president who said at the meeting on Saturday night: “I tell you what the situation is: his body language was very bad.
He may not have leaked it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women by claiming that the Democrats would use the alleged charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to use whatever means they can, but to regain power.
You can see the insolence, the hatred, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run through to gain power and control," said the President Mediaite.

Air traffic controller has lost his life so that hundreds on board can escape the earthquake.
As a hero, they celebrate an air traffic controller in Indonesia who lost his life while making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people could safely board.
More than eight hundred were killed and many disappeared after the earthquake struck Celebes Island on Friday, which resulted in an earthquake.
There are still strong extremisms in the area, and many people have been forced into ruins in the city of Palau.
However, despite the fact that their colleagues escaped saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in the wildly flying control tower.
He stayed there so that Batik Air's flight of 6321 already on the runway could be safely boarded.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
Later, he lost his life at the hospital.
According to Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesperson, Yohannes Sirai, the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the case to the Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
“Our hearts were tight when we heard the news,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can be several thousand, and according to the country's disaster response organisation, the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong are difficult to approach.
“The number of victims is likely to increase further, as many of them have been trapped under the ruins and many have not been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the organization.
The waves that reached a height of six metres destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry assistance and supplies.
A 35 - year - old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “The ambulances bring more bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
Stores have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the Indonesian leader of the International Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors with time, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be worse than that.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, arrived on Sunday, and asked the country’s soldiers to: “I ask them to work day and night to do the evacuation-related tasks!
Are they ready?" The CNN reporting.
This year, Indonesia has already been hit by earthquakes on Lombok Island, where more than five hundred and fifty died.
Micronesia accident: According to Air Niugini, a person disappeared from the lagoon accident
According to the latest announcement by an airline operating a plane crash in Micronesia, in the Pacific lagoon, one person disappeared, although previously claimed that both 47 passengers and crew evacuated from the sinking plane were successful.
According to Air Niugini's press release, on Sunday afternoon's situation, a man can't account for a passenger.
According to the airline, he cooperates with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to any further information on the passenger, such as questions about his age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water during the landing at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people were being transported to the hospital.
According to the airline, there are six passengers left at the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events are not yet clear.
According to the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses say the plane missed the runway.
An American passenger named Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
“This is a terriblely good thing,” commented Jaynes.
Jaynes told me that, along with others, he was able to run in water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
According to her, the escorts were panicking and screaming, and she suffered minor head injuries.
According to the U.S. Navy, shipmen who repaired a cargo beach were also helping to rescue people, and they were taking an inflatable boat to the beach before the plane sank 30 metres below the water.
According to Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in accidents involving airlines with PNG registration in the last two decades, but none of them have affected Air Niugini.
Analyst compiled the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The D.A. announced to the defendant on Saturday at the retrial of the man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
An analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an information analysis expert.
He explained to the jury how he compiled the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements on the night of her death with the help of his mobile phone records.
According to Rowlett, he received location data from several telephones, according to which he was with Tellis Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicts the man’s earlier statements, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when the man said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford gave his testimony on Saturday, during which he told me that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was "really lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis said she knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
Based on cell phone data, they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett reported that, after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
"He erased her from her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin his closing speech on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be brought before the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hiphop?
A hippoptrio called for a negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
According to Bristol The High Breed, hiphop has moved away from the roots of political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to these roots and make the conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common are once again popular in the United Kingdom thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
The nanny in New York sued me for firing a party after a "racist" message.
A nanny in New York sued a couple for disappropriation after the mother complained in a wrongly sent message that they had failed to apply a ‘ black’ nanny again.
The couple deny that they are racists, and the lawsuit is similar to “crowding. ”
The two-child mother, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was disappointed when she saw that she was black on the first working day when Giselle Maurice arrived in 2016.
“I DON’t know if it’s a black person,” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after he woke up to his delusion, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt himself “unplenished,” dismissed Ms. Maurice, claiming that the leaving nanny, who was African-American, did a bad job and was expecting a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day's work and sent home with a Uber.
Maurice is now suing the party for compensation for the dismissal and asking for a daily compensation of 350 dollars for the six-month in-house work for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them how to stop the procession,” he said to the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the claims of racism that it was reasonable to stop Maurice's use because they were afraid they could not trust her after she was violated.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," said the husband, Joel Plasco, to the Post.
"But would you trust your children to someone with whom, even if by chance, he was rude?
Your newborn?
Come on!"
According to Plasco, similar to the “crowding” of the case, his wife only had the baby two months ago, and “was in a very difficult situation”.
"Can someone attack such a thing?
It's not very nice to do this," the investment banker added.
While the legal procedure is under way, the public court has quickly condemned the party in the social media, undermining their behaviour and logic.
According to a letter now found, Paddington's publisher feared that readers would not be able to relate to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to imagine ourselves as someone who will first read it before his publication.
It's quite fun this information now that we know what a huge success it is on Paddington."
He said that his father, who worked as the cameraman of the BBC, before he was inspired to write a children’s book about a little teddy bear, would not have been a problem if his work had been rejected, and then added that the 60th anniversary of the book was a bitter success after his father’s death last year.
Paddington was called “a very important member of their family, ” and he added that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, he wasn’t at all delusional,” he said.
"But since Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a child who brought him something: we are proud of him even if he is not really our merit.
I think Paddington's success must have been something like this.
Although he created it and fell out of his imagination, he always attributed the success to himself, Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
When he landed, his daughter was in the hospital of Louis Pasteur, Nice, where the doctors fought in vain for his life.
“They regularly called to tell me that she was in a very bad state and that she was not expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received a call from Nad saying that my daughter will die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
I said goodbye.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were slowly run out and then left his body.
He died before, and then everything stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that everything was over.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a place surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning for her daughter's loss, she boarded the plane with the others who didn't care about the trial she was going through.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I bowed down my head, and all the time, my tears were snorting.
It's hard to explain, but on that plane, I had this overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That you need my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much."
Card for the prevention of suicide on the bridge with grieving women
Two women who lost their loved ones because of suicide are working to stop them, so others don't throw their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey put out postcards full of inspirational messages and emergency numbers on a Welsh bridge.
Ms. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he became depressed and then committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, told me that his son was a promising cook, and his grin got stuck on everyone.
“He knew about everyone’s smile.
They always said that his smile would throw up any place."
However, before he died, he gave up his work because he was in “very bad” condition."
Tyler, who ended his life with his own hands, was found by his 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said: “I was constantly concerned that this would have some domino effect.”
Ms. David made the postcards with the aim “that people may know that there are some people who can be visited and spoken to, even if it is just a friend.
Don't sit quietly – you need to talk!"
Ms. Humphreys, a friend of Ms. Davies's, lost Mark for 15 years, shortly after the man's mother died.
“He didn’t say he was depressed, depressed or anything,” he said.
“Some days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
She was totally under you on Christmas Day: when the kids opened their presents, she didn't look them in the eye and stuff."
He said that his death was a major trauma to them, but they had to deal with it: “He left a huge hole in the family.
He broke our hearts to pieces.
But we must continue to fight."

Questionable Brett Kavanaugh's future as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought that if he could achieve what he asked for — a limited-time limited investigation — we might be able to reach an agreement” – Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that the committee was afraid that he would fall to pieces because of the party’s indecision.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters oppose the FBI investigation?
Their resistance can only be due to timing.
The interim election is only five weeks away on November 6th, and if the Republicans are not expected to do well, it will be much harder for them to get their men into the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby with them for support from Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and he also met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive the minimum of 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to take a decision to bring Mr. Kavanaugh before the Supreme Court.
Number of dissidents in North Korea "decreased" under Kim
The number of North Korean dissidents to South Korea has decreased since Kim Dzsongun came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Bjengsek quoted the data of the Ministry of Southern Merger and said that in the last year, 1127 dissidents compared to 2011, when this number was 2706.
Park said that the closer border guard between North Korea and China and the higher penalties imposed on smugglers were the main reasons.
Phenjan did not comment on this information publicly.
Most of the northern dissidents eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee to China, which is the longest border to North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
Dissidents are received by China as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and are often sent back by force.
In practice, the relationship between the North and the South still at war has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leader of the two countries met in Phenjan, where the closed nuclear decommissioning negotiations were at the heart of their meeting.
This was the historic meeting between President Donald Trump and President Kim Dzsongun in Singapore in June, where they agreed in large lines on further cooperation on the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the Americans, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is inconceivable that we will release our weapons unilaterally,” Ri said in her speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "histerical", he said it was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
The minority president of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, “histerical” and claimed that his conduct was not in line with the work of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I thought that if a woman were to behave like this at any time, I would call her “histeric”,” she explained Pelosi’s reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was burning his feelings against the rumors that he would have sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when he was a teenager.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he screamed and his voice fell away when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
In addition, he strongly condemned the Committee's Democrats, and the accusations against him were organised by angry liberals due to the defeat of Hillary Clinton at the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he felt that Kavanaugh's behaviour proved that he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
“I believe that he excluded himself with his statements and the conduct he showed against the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi hesitated when he asked if he would try to bring Kavanaugh to justice, in case it filled the post, and if the Democrats acquired the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I say that if you don’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, it’s not only not for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where you are now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently in a judicial position at the Capital Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that he was concerned as a Democrat about the possible decisions made by Kavanaugh in connection with the Act on affordable care or Roe vs. Wade, as Kavanugh is a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh's hearings, he avoided questions about whether to copy the rulings of the Supreme Court.
“It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to become a member of the court, and he expects us to tear it apart from joy,” said Pelosi.
And women have to control it.
It's a legitimate outburst, months and years of rage that's been on the surface, and it can't let it out without crying.
“We cry when we're angry,” said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that rare, do I?"
“I was helped by a woman who worked in a leadership position,” she continued. “She said to me that she was crying in anger, but she worked out a technique that said that when she started crying in anger, she told her talking partner: ‘You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I am angry.”
And then he kept going.
And I thought that was a great idea."
Partly they view tears as a sign of anger because they basically misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of an early job, an office run by men, where I once cried in my angry inactivity, that an older woman — a cool manager I was always afraid of — grabbed me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," he said to me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be satisfied because they've been able to upset you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democrat Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with an out-of-wedlock affair on Monkey Business's hair, he fell out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, in his deep frustration, he discovered that there was no reason why he couldn't run for the presidency himself.
“It was not a well thought-out decision,” he said, laughing to me 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the competition, and the new candidate was wanted to be in the middle of their backs.
Someone named it "The Snow Whites and the Seven Dwarves."
Since the campaign has been going on for a long time, Ms. Schroeder missed the raise, so she swore she wouldn't compete unless she collected the $2 million.
It was a battle to lose.
He realized that some of his supporters gave the men $1,000, but he only got $250.
“They thought I was getting a discount?” he meditated.
When he held a press conference that he did not launch an official campaign, his feelings were so poured out because of his gratitude for the people who supported him, as well as because of the frustration and sexuality of the system that made the collection of money and the direct access of voters difficult to achieve.
“They thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to it.
“They believed that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my tombstone?
“Crying”?"
How can the US-China Trade War be good for Beijing?
The trade war between the USA and China was almost an ear cutter, and the battle was not nearly over yet, but the country-to-country break-up, according to experts, could benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warnings at the beginning of the year by taxing the most important Chinese export products, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most significant episode occurred this week, as the new duties already affect a product worth 200 billion dollars, practically taxing half of the goods coming from China to the USA.
In all cases, Beijing reduced its duty between five and ten percent to $60 billion in US.
China has pledged to fight back every time, and the second largest economy in the world will certainly not back down in the near future.
If you'd like to get Washington to back off, it would mean you're gonna have to give your ass up in front of the demands, but a public bow to the US would be too embarrassing for the president of Hsi Chin-ping, China.
Yet, according to the experts, if Beijing is well-tacticed, the U.S. trade war pressure will benefit China in the long term, as it will reduce dependence on the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision can create conditions in either Washington or Beijing that could force any economy of the two countries into an economic vortex is far more serious than the observers previously recognised,” said Abigail Grace, Asian research assistant at the New American Security.
Syria is “ready” to return refugees, states the Foreign Minister
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in the reconstruction of the country destroyed during the war for more than seven years.
In his speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Vald Moallem claimed that the state's condition would improve.
“The current situation is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now, there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, who had to flee between terrorism and the economic measures that have been taken on their own, which have affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Another six million people in the country need humanitarian help.
Moallem said that the Syrian state would be happy to receive all the help it needs to rebuild the country.
He stressed, however, that no conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion would be accepted.
Europe got the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team in 16.5:10,5 out of Paris on Le Gold National.
The United States has now failed six times in a row on the European stage and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has protected its championship title, as the Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn's team has reached the 14.5 point needed to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star player who fought all over the tournament, put a hit in the water at par-3, 16th hole, handing Francesco Molinari the victory.
The Italian golfer Molinari has become one of the 4 players who have ever scored 5-0-0 since the tournament started in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth received 5-4-4 from the lowest-ranking player of the European team, the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2-4-1 against Ian Poulter, who may have participated in his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cup veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the best European winner of the tournament with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I couldn’t stop.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy, I got the cup back.
It's all about the team, and I'm happy that I could help," he said after the European victory of Garcia, who is struggling with his emotions.
The stafetabot will be handed over to Jon Rahm, who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2-4-1.
“I am so proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this man,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France, and now has a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
It's a weird statistics from one of the biggest players of all time who've won 14 main titles, and only Jack Nicklaus is ahead of.
The U.S. team has been struggling all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who have been a great golfer throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing outcome of the United States team captain Jim Furyk’s team, he said that “he is proud of these guys because they fought.
There was a time this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Put your hat down in front of Thomas.
That's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup our team, work with American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to lift your hats, too.
The opponent was better than us."
