Eemeli Kouki led Hurricane home victory in the opening - another victory for Savo Volley
After seven consecutive times, Hurricane-Loimaa at the men's volleyball medals began the season 2018-19 with home victory when Raision Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
Emeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most effective player in Hurricane at 22 points.
There were some tunes for the foreign countries, but they did not come true, and then came the call from Loimaa.
Well, it was pretty quick to make a deal, Kouki said.
Like Hook, Tomi Rumpunen also played Kouki at 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo, a national team player with a match-by-game agreement, at 17 points.
It's always important to win an opening game.
Many players had experience from the opponent, and it brought extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra
Our game is not yet ready, but the goal is, of course, to continue the medal pipe, Kouki said.
The most effective way for Savo Volley
Miro Mättänen was 18 points more effective than Savo Volley, when the team poured the Next to Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
Our game was fluctuating, especially in the head of the attack, but fortunately we won.
At least I didn't have any conscious different charge when I played against my former team, Mättänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the next Volleyball 3 series during the period 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Chief Coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, or the atmosphere on the roof all the time.
I left a good file on the autopsy.
Miro was a king, the Pill played a good game, Tuovinen said.
The previous season of Siltala in the league was 2006-07, then he won silver at Pielavesi Sampo, while Tuovinen was still head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the most effective Ducks had at 14 points.
Mikkonen again Aka-Volley star
In 2012-13, Joni Mikkonen, who won the league's point exchange, has also started this season strongly.
The hacker scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took the season's opening victory after falling Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has begun perfectly well.
Today, of course, we were close to losing, because we were in the fourth round of loss between 17 and 21.
A win was dug, and the fifth round came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago still in the finals the tigers were the most effective was 28 points made by the hacker Edvarts Buivids.
Landman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported by 17 points.
We didn't get much touch on the guy's hacker, Mikkonen said.
Finland is the world's number one in comparison with human capital
Finland is at the top of the world in the comparison of human capital, says the scientific journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was the number one of the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands followed Finland.
Later, the Netherlands placed one higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, the worst comparisons were between Niger and South Sudan.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population is examined.
The World Bank has focused human capital on economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico under control.
Real Madrid goaltender Thibaut Courtois took a stretch of anti-globals, and the local game of the Madrid teams ended in a goalless game late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico, from Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest target, but the Belgian guard Courtois had time to fight.
Courtois played in Atletico through three of his loan-pest players in Chelsea.
In the beginning of the week, the International Football Union Fifa chose him as the goalkeeper of the year.
In real, Gareth Bale received the best goal, but his shot was directed past the end of the opening half of the goal.
After the break, Bale was switched for the femoral injury.
According to ESPN, the disillusioned Realists cried out the name of the target gun that moved to Juventus.
In the United States, we are now attacking abortion law - a powerful document tells us why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be selected as the candidate for President Donald Trump, Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that the decisive vote of Kavanaugh would reverse the decision known as Roe v Wade, which in the United States made abortion legal in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg’s documentary Reversing Roe - United States and abortion rights show how the present situation has been happening over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done public service work against safe abortion and has received various degrees of support from the majority of representatives of our country.
At the beginning of the powerful document, Gynecologist Colleen McNicholas is met, who has remained the only doctor responsible for abortions in Missouri.
An armed guard at the clinic says he's defending the freedom of the U.S. religion.
News videos remind me of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move on to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran churchmen’s association directed women to reliable abortion doctors.
The argument put forward by the interviewed pastor is good, but in fact they are not even needed; a photograph of a woman who died in an abortion herself is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the United States.
The legalization of abortions was defended by the Republican Party in particular.
Already in 1967, the abortion law in California signed Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in her presidential election campaign in 1980, that began to invertify religion into politics to catch voters.
His abortion rate was also reversed by his successor, George Bush, the elder.
And so did Donald Trump.
At the heart of the matter, the document reaches in search of the basis for the politicalization of abortion.
When religious organizations in favour of racial separation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a stick horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary nodes into politics.
In writing this in the United States, there is a situation in which the President, who has taken the voices of the religious right with his abortion, has chosen Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court, who is now accused of sexual harassment by several women.
Kavanaugh can have the power to exercise the power based on the scale of the station to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children, at the border, with large demonstrations.
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel has been firing protestors in the border zone.
Israel’s soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the border zone of Gaza on Friday, says the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two children are among the dead: boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded from the bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and struck the border zone as the protesters threw stones and explosives at Israel’s troops.
The army says that it has begun its use of force, that the protestors do not break down the border fence or attempt to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in the demonstrations of Gaza since March, when the Palestinians started the weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12 000 are wounded.
Pro-Palestinian families were called for access to areas where Palestinians were forced to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped by lions and helium balls sent from the Palestinian side have sparked forest areas and farmlands in Israel.
Teemu Santa got a punishment shot. He couldn't shoot himself.
Wigan's top pair, Chey Dunkley, seemed to have overthrown him with a battle behind him in the penalty zone.
Judge Gavin Ward let the game go on.
According to her interpretation, the tack was clean.
The theme Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think it's been a bit of trouble for Judge Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a punishment in the 85th minute that Santa was killed.
Ward showed a penalty point, and Mario Vrancic rocked a 1-0 win-win paint.
Santa has scored Norwich five goals in the Championship.
Last Saturday, the previous one was born against QPR in an elegant chest muscle.
The job tastes like Santa again.
After he lost the ball, he went all the way to the end of the situation.
He created paint situations and defended himself tirelessly.
For Norwich, the fight was the fifth in two weeks.
The team will continue in the league cup.
There's a five-win tube in the back.
Pedophile assistance was immediately filled with reservations - approximately 40 000 people in Finland experience interest in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in the prosthetic age.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
So far, it has been difficult for those who are sexually interested in children or adolescents to get help.
The joint SeriE project of the Criminal Service Support Foundation and Sexpo will train professionals to meet pedophiles as customers and help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, the e-mail flood and appointment times in Sexpo for advice and therapy began very quickly, says Yle.
However, these are promised to be released in the autumn.
A sexual attitude toward children is a disgrace to many.
Most of those who take note of pedophilic feelings in themselves have not carried out their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, the preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope that they will get rid of the thoughts that trouble and depress them.
They also trouble normal life, says the sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who acts as a specialist in the project.
I think the job is valuable if one child is saved from sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Chore leaders or Congolese gynecologist?
As the winner of the US President Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, the thought may suddenly sound strange, but based on the betting factors, Trump is one of the biggest favorites for the prize.
The role of Trump in getting North Korea, at least at speech level, is to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest favorites for Nobel are South Korean President Moon Jae and North Korean leader Kim Jong, who have already met three times this year and promised to reach a peace agreement between their countries.
Warming between the chores is considerable, since last year the distances were still in vain.
Yet, the reward for Kim, which led to his nuclear weapons and his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and Friday will be the most prominent, or Peace Prize.
If the award is not given to those who have participated in the Korean Peninsula diplomacy, one of the top candidates is the Congolese doctor, Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo has dealt with thousands of women who have been subjected to mass rape and have become a leading expert in the world.
In his work, Mukwege has paid attention to sexual violence, which is a creepy byproduct of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been the UN refugee organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has said that this year, 331 candidates will be awarded the prize.
The names of the candidates are not disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if he had Nobel.
In May, the reporter asked him if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everybody thinks so, but I would never say it myself, Trump said it with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the world, and the President continued to refer to the North Korean negotiations.
However, there are things that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Nobel Committee, which is the award-winning committee of Norway, has often given recognition to people and organisations who represent liberal democracy and a multi-faceted world order - just the kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as an adversary.
In the 21st century, three US politicians have received the prize, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So it would require an ideological translation of the Nobel Committee to reward the Trump.
Fire notice in the tunnel: Drivers behaved like corporals and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos in the 1st Dragon took place on 8 September.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was cut both towards Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that there was a systemic problem, the fire department tried to make transport normal.
However, it did not work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said that it can't be opened because there are drivers in the road to create a shock and they're driving, and the firefighter Pasi Kääriäinen told the new STT at the time.
At that time, the freeway was set off in the wrong direction only after a moment of waiting.
When the first begins to act against traffic rules, some others are often followed, and Tapio Heiskanen, Contact Manager for Transport Security, is amazed.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop for more than a compelling reason.
Road safety points out that in exceptional circumstances, transport cannot be jeopardised by urgent solutions.
Alarm vehicles shall always provide the best possible accessible passage.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the freeway is prohibited, as is making a U-turn and cancelling it.
The same prohibitions apply also in tunnels where the headlamps must also always be switched on.
It is also prohibited to stop for no compelling reason, as is, of course, parking.
Recently there have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity, says Heiskanen in the Transport Safety Bulletin.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party, even though the ship was caught on the bottom of the lake.
The Ilves fans carried by the Inland Watership M/S to Tampere would have liked to stay on the ship to continue the victory party, even though the ship had been caught in the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was in charge at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, which was on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late on Saturday night and was caught on its bow in Vanajavede in Akaa.
Nineteen passengers and five crew members aboard were evacuated at night to the mainland.
No one got hurt in the pals.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their party on the boat until morning, but of course it was more reasonable to send them on a fire station ride home and on a bus, Syrjä said to the STT.
Ilves fans had been to Hämeenlinna to watch Ilves and HPK fight, which ended in the 4-3 victory of Ilves.
According to the Circumstances, Saturday’s buddy was due to the water’s surface on the Old Sea, about a half a meter below normal.
According to Syrja, navigation was also made difficult by the fact that the nearest sign was covered with log waste, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No further impact
The guy took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi shortly after the shipping route had reached the Tampere-Helsingin motorway bridge.
According to Syrja, there was no greater drama, as the ship’s speed at the time of the event was very low and the impact did not give rise to a more marked collision.
According to the Discurbation, the ship has not been leaked or repressed, and the cruises of the ship continue normally.
On Saturday morning, the diver came to check the ship’s condition before the ship was towed.
To be sure, we're still at the shipyard to check that there's been no damage, says Syrjä.
The discrimination believes that the next cruise to Tampere, scheduled for next weekend, can be handled in an agreed manner.
According to him, the cruise period of the ship continues until the day of independence.
No use in ambulances
The rescue unit received an alert on the case on Saturday night shortly after half twelve.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Vyala to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for the ambulances.
In the late evening, the firefighter Matti Willman told me that the conditions for evacuation on the lake were difficult because of the darkness and a rather heavy wind.
After half three days, Pirkanmaa rescue facility announced on Sunday night that all those on board have been evacuated and passengers have been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser built in 1957 has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's referee accused of harassment and drinking may be out of line.
Brett Kavanaugh, a U.S. Supreme Court judge, may well be absent from the post he is seeking, assessing the programme director, Mika Aaltola, from the Institute for Foreign Policy.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct during his studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump can end up putting another person in office.
In the United States, it has happened once in a while that the President’s candidate for the Supreme Court has raised many conflicts.
In this case, the candidate for the court has usually been withdrawn, says Aaltola.
That's how the President has been able to keep his face.
The name would fall into the camp of the Democrats.
The US Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but, at least in Kavanaugh's case, the election of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision is likely to rain into the camp of the Democratic Party in the forthcoming mid-terms of Congress.
It would increase the voting power among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
There is no opportunity for every presidential term, as the Supreme Court judges are appointed in the United States for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at about 70-80 years of age.
Some of the Republicans also hesitate to call it
The U.S. Supreme Court will normally have a background check, says Aaltoa.
Although Trump has only set a deadline of one week for the FBI's further investigation, it can still, according to Aalto, bring out something essential.
Yes, it might.
Rarely there is smoke without fire, says Aaltoa.
According to Aalto, it is at least certain that the suitability or suitability of Kavanaugh for office will be discussed actively before the Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority in the Senate, with 51-49 votes, but at least two women's Republicans are thought to be suspicious of Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the name would be taken to the vote and the Republicans would lose.
A woman identified Salisbury as a suspected military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has informed the BBC that she has identified Salisbury as a Russian military intelligence agent for the poisoning.
Based on the photographs, the woman reported that it was a military intelligence mission at the GRU, Anatoli Tshepiga.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia previously revealed that one of the men suspected of poisoning was Tshepiga.
They said earlier that they had found evidence that men’s present identities are covert.
The BBC group traveled to the Far East to a village near the Russian-China border where Tshepiga grew up.
The woman in the village identified young Chepigan Bellingcat’s photos.
He identified the same man from the British police photos of a man who called himself Ruslan Boschiro today.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok nerve poison in March.
The scripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded, among other things, the Russian hero's medal in 2014.
Russia is still denying the GRU connection of the suspect.
The men suspected of poisoning previously reported that they were tourists at Salisbury in their interview with Russian TV in September.
Old people in throwing bags in sote reform
There is now a live example of what Sipilä's government means in practice to limit the change in the reform of the sote.
The Sote services of my municipality Vaala are provided by the Oulunkaar municipality association, which has been elected as the head of health care services in 2016 by the former regional director of Attendo.
The Heads of the Association shall warn the delegation of the change limiter.
If the sote expenditure rises now, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The city’s central decision-makers were frightened, and most of them were prepared for a major restructuring of the care of the elderly, which would end the hospital care and the small unit for memory diseases at the health centre.
Home health care would be increased, which means long distances in Vala would mean that the elderly in remote villages would be torn from their roots to the health centre for treatment at home.
Attendo trusted that the municipality would pay the customers.
The left of the whale did not absorb bad preparations, but held a good public event, with many family nurses, close nurses and other parties' representatives.
I presented the preparation of the Sote region with dia on how the elderly are already treated at home in the municipality of Valala, the most often in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
Carina West, who had been authorised by the neighbourhood, was also involved.
The local paper made a big story about the occasion, and it raised the Oulunkaari’s preparation for the back leg.
Sote manufacturers do not write in any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Valaa, which is now waiting for empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
Manufacturers only talk about a service bill, but do not tell what level of care it receives or what type of staff structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until they are treated.
Without a nurse?
Namely, the facilities at the health centre will be closed because there is no doctor’s night-care centre.
Attendo will also rely on doctors from the Vala Health Centre.
The example of the whale shows how central officials run the councils with incomplete information and the delegates are pushed against the wall with a change limiter.
This is how the Central Party will empty the people of Vaala, for who will remain there insecurity to live voluntarily if there is a possibility of moving away.
Was there one vote in the centre that the whole country is kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opened a major mosque in Cologne
In Germany, thousands of people in the city of Cologne expressed their opinion when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened the largest mosque in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the Rhine River from the morning.
Erdogan you are not welcome, read on the protesters' signs, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have been organised during the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, and the security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, some 10,000 people were expected to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
In addition, Erdogan’s supporters had gathered in the vicinity of the major mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area from the mosque for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Mr Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and estimated that it strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel swore to rebuild relations between countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
However, Mr Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between countries on issues such as human rights.
Review Surrounding Visit
Both the mayor of Cologne, Henriette Reker, and the Prime Minister of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, withdrew their participation in the opening when the criticism of Erdogan's visit accelerated.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, reported having come to the protest against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice to those who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, anything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the final phase of the German journey to Erdogan, North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is Turkish.
In Slovakia, three people are charged with murdering a journalist.
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the prosecutor told me that three people are being charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancee and other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the connections between politicians and the Italian Mafia.
Police have suspected the murders were connected to Kuciak's investigation.
The case and Kuciak's article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems in the distribution of the herd on Sunday in the dispersal areas
Due to a print failure, also Sunday’s Karjalainen will have to be mailed without an address.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in the dispersal areas where the distribution to the collective boxes is required to be carried out from memory.
The situation was the same for the Saturday magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Posting puts extra paper bouquets in the province.
The newspapers of other Finnish subscribers will not be posted until Monday.
The distribution of these magazines is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Today, editor Arto Nyberg interviews Vesa Heilala, among others, directly in his forthcoming discussion programme.
Vesa is in the studio telling about her future space trip, which she booked from Virgin Galactica as early as 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which was to be paid in the form of a bank loan.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed for a year.
It now seems that after the unfortunate pilot flight, which occurred in 2014, and which also required the death sacrifice, things are in order.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or at the latest next year.
The number of the Vesa flight is 300, which means that his journey is about a year from his first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and is in an unweight state for 5 minutes at 100 km, the Finnish astronaut tells of the future on his website.
At the same address, he also goes back to his longing for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Travel, and I saw the Star Trek series on TV.
The Star Wars have been seen, and that's why the thought of that has come to an end.
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a rude host.
Manchester City continued its harmless journey to Valoliga on Saturday, when it poured Brighton paints 2-0 at its home field.
The sixth winners of the reigning team are Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was allowed to direct the fourth hit of the season to an empty finish, when Leroy Sané found him in the back of Brighton's goal in 30 minutes.
Agüero raised his own score to five when he and Sterling sawed the Brighton defense to pieces in 65th game minutes.
The Argentinian was able to easily place the 2-0 ending points at the penalty point.
With six wins and one draw, the city that started the season will lead Valoliiga with 19 points.
However, one less player in the match is stalking Liverpool only one point away.
Liverpool will meet Chelsea in her seventh round on Saturday night.
Youth clubs selected new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Society selected new decision-makers for its next three-year period 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected Chairman and Vice-President Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme.
40 members and 40 alternate members of the Board of Governors were elected, the Finnish Youth Associations will be informed on Sunday.
The youth club meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for their quality and safety.
Therefore, the Youth Society Conference in Joensuu makes three promises in its three-year operating goals: We keep the doors open for everyone, and we organise a level playing field regardless of their place of residence and background, and we support voluntary activities and people on their own growth paths, the Finnish Youth Society reports in its release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and amazed Ferrari: "To lose a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, the Britishman of Mersu was asked whether he believed that the release of Kimi Räikkösen from Ferrari’s services would help Hamilton during the rest of the year.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver, Sebastian Vettel, with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari told us that Räikkönen would not continue in the stable next season, while Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton does not believe that Räikkönen would put his hands on the counter.
I don't think Kimi's gonna change in the remaining games.
He's an exceptional professional... a fantastic driver.
He will remain one of my favorites, and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has told me before that Räikkönen has been one of his role models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and I dreamt of the first formula, I played the F1 game at PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday at the Russian semi-final.
The race starts at 14 o'clock at the bonfire will take place in the Valter Bottas of Mercedes.
The evening paper follows the moment of the race.
The A-youth Championship for football became a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players.
The highest level of football boys will end on Saturday, when the last round of the season will be played.
The starting point for the championship campaign was clear before 1 p.m.: FC Lahti to the Academy is in practice enough for the first class against Vasa IFK.
In order to reverse the situation in the last round, Ilves, second in the championship, must win an PK-35 and hope for the Lahti defeat.
However, the Lahti Championship was established in practice even before the start week, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one fewer vases, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match from 16-0.
In the break, the Gulfmen led 7-0.
One reason for the loss of players is that the team has partly played the A-youth SM series, the P20 series, and the C-section of men.
Left IFK has played in Second against the fall of the entire season.
In the second round of the finals on Saturday, Vasa IFK will be forced to win the JBK in the guest match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its own guest match against KuFu in Siilinjärvi Toivala.
The car ended up on the roof in Eno. According to the rescue unit, luck was involved.
The passenger car drifted out of the way and ended up on a roof on the Eno on the Chat-Warth Sunday around 9:00 p.m.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, and the rescue unit is reporting.
Good luck, the press release says.
According to the rescue unit, the road was wet after the rain.
Police patrol went to the crash site.
Supo expects new ways of intelligence: Equipment acquisitions and recruitments already made, no skimming from planning abroad.
According to Antti Peltari, Chief of Supo, the intelligence services have been prepared to purchase equipment and train staff.
Upon the entry into force of the intelligence laws, there would be a permanent increase of some EUR 10 million in the budget for soup.
The protective police (supo) facilities located on Ratakatu of Helsinki are already preparing their full heads for the entry into force of the intelligence companies.
Antti Pelttar, Head of Supo's composition, informs the West Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence missions.
Serena Williams startles with a video of her singing in the topless, campaigning for breast cancer awareness.
The superstar of tennis, Serena Williams, is back on track.
Now he is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video in his Instagram account, where he sings only his hands in front of his breasts, says AFP.
The song is Australian The Divinyls’ 1991 hit I Touch Myself.
On the video Williams supports the activities of the Australian breast cancer association.
"I voted with The Divinyls' global hit to remind women to perform their own [breast] checks regularly," Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in the discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women regardless of the colour of the skin around the world.
Early detection is all a and o - it scares many lives.
The second writer of The Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at 53 years old.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," says Williams.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was published early on Sunday morning.
In the comments of the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
The background is in the open US tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams came to the main judge of the match and claimed, among other things, that men were accepted for much more violent behavior than female players.
The Chinese restaurant on the mountain path is not suitable for the horrendous
In addition to traditional Chinese treats, the restaurant serves magnificent landscapes.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the province of Zhejiang in China.
It is literally located on a cliff.
You can look at the forest that spreads under there if you want.
The steep landscapes at the heights make the restaurant visitors breathe their lives in the Longquan Mountains.
To get to the restaurant requires a trip in the middle of the peach trees.
The restaurant opened for migrants on 19.9.2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant's bathroom is located.
A trip to a restaurant requires good basic condition, the place is told.
This is how it ends.
All good things will end in time.
Today, this is what happens to the domestic country drama, the Korpela alley race, which has been quite held.
The third production season has gone as hot stones: last week, 722,000 Finns viewed the episode as a first performance on television.
The peak figures do not in themselves have any practical significance anymore, as Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen will not have any follow-up to the series.
In the final phase, the relationship between the Russian and Mirku will be taken forward again, and I think the American mother will be the first to guess what to expect.
The relationship between Anss and Miisa is warm, in the light of recent events they are quite romantic, but then again Laho appears in the patterns.
The police are also in a position of suspicion over a swan man.
But no one knows what happened to Laho in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, is getting incredible news.
The last will of a distance comes out, which leads a woman to the brink of tears.
In a week's time at Sunday nights, the latest seasons of Sorjonen will continue.
The Korpelan alley race today on TV1 at 21.05.
Is it worth working on a little cold tomorrow?
Here's the facts for and against
The flu season's hot.
Many lotteries will stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether to go infecting others, for the disease may be contagious even if its symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly strike, sometimes they appear in the nipples.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your symptoms are small," says the Prevention release.
So it's worth staying home?
Prevention indicates that the flu is contagious even when the person does not have symptoms.
The virus will be infected for a day before and from five days to a week.
Children may become infected longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough stops and the fever is no longer there, says medical professor Gregory Poland.
You should also avoid training.
Too fast a return to the gym slows the recovery.
Also, wash your hands, put them on your handkerchief, and throw them in the trash.
You're sick, though?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask does not control viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
That's when you don't put your fingers in your nose or your mouth, says Poland.
Sneezings are also limited to the mask.
How, then, can we avoid infections?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
In the United States, for example, average people touch their eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland repeats the Mission tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
The hockey player and the misses are often linked together.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova at 23.
Alina Voronkova, from Pertunmaa, has received the 2018 Miss Suomen kroon.
The beautiful lady now lives in Lahti, where she moved to when she was 15.
Alina's mother is an Inkerin Finn and her father is a Russian.
About the Russian father, Voronkova was bullied at school.
My mother and father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my Russianism.
In Pertunmaa, I had no friends at all, Alina tells me about the publication of Miss Finland's semifinalists.
After high school, Alina decided to start off at a clean table and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the Miss Missyunotar found new friends, and the ark went to roll as desired.
At 15 years of age, he thinks he's an adult, but I wasn't thinking about it afterwards.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurrin, who is familiar with the lines of Pelicans.
After a career in the MS League, the hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team in the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived in almost a year’s distance, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning three and with that I could have a career, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, our trust works well and in a distance is the good thing that it will stay above the spark, Alina smiled in May.
With joy of continuous growth, death on our shoulders
Almost everyone is concerned about the endurance of the earth.
But it's just that you don't want to give up anything.
Sustainable alternatives to continuous growth are sought, but even the theory of a fair economy runs into major problems.
In a few generations, continuous economic growth has led to normal people, especially in the northern hemisphere, to a standard of living that could only be dreamed of.
However, the long-lasting overrun of the earth’s carrying capacity and climate change are causing this rock leg of the market economy to collapse in a dangerous way.
Two men were stabbed on Sunday night in Kannelmä, Sitrator, at four o’clock in the morning.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured by a stab, and another one was born in 1968 less easily.
The older men are already out of the hospital.
The police have captured one person whose possible contribution to the stab will be investigated.
The police are also looking for another suspect involved in the events.
Events are investigated as an attempt to kill and as a gross assault.

We made a lot of mistakes during the opening phase, but fortunately, the Turku goal brought us more into the game.
According to John Allen, head coach of the Inter, the game was under control, but the goal was again painful.
One mistake in our defense took a full spot on us, Allen was sorry.
We were the best again!

The leaf showed its underpower, the place of play is not yet certain
Jori Lehterä's strong underpower game emerged when his NHL club Philadelphia Flyers played his last training match before the beginning of the season.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehtera fed Michael Raffle twice to score.
In the last few days, Lehter has been on the scene because of the drug suspicions.
On Wednesday, MTV reported that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in a drug prison, where he is suspected of using drugs and knows about selling, for example.
The paper has denied to have committed a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the subject, and NHL is investigating the case.
After the match, Sam Carchidi, the editor of the next Philadelphia Inquirer magazine, closely following Flyers, estimates that Lehter is part of a group of six attackers, five of whom will be on the NHL team.
According to Carchid, the Lehterä was excellent in the training match.
In the second round, Lehterä fought the puck with subdued power, pulled the defender over and fed him to Raffli’s open spot in front of the goal.
The second time the twin co-operation brought the goal right at the end of the match.
Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4th with a guest match against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Urho Vakainen is waiting for the team's coaching team to decide whether or not to join the NHL team.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now the coachs will decide if I can play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL, and the Horizontal said in an interview published on Boston's Twitter account.
In the river boys, the horizontal woman who learned her pucking lesson played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.

The latest image shows a change: the strongest man in the world lost tens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the world's strongest man, is undergoing a striking transformation.
The Britishman Eddie Hall hunted the title of the world's strongest man for a long and determined time.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalords a day and, according to the Mirror magazine, weighs up to 200 kilos.
The shirts were 5XL in size.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted to doing harm to his body.
The human body has not been created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted the world's strongest man's victory by all means, and the family man promised to end his career if I got the title.
Hall didn't want her children to grow up without her father.
Hall kept his promise, and he was no longer seen in April 2018 in the strongest male in the world.
In Instagram, Hall recently published an image in which he poses his active career in a much weaker condition.
Hall writes that its current weight is 169,5 kilos.
Hall wrote that he's been training five times a week in aerobics.
The program includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall is doing four exercises a week in the gym.
This year, the world's strongest man was weighed by the Icelandic, Game of Thrones TV series Hafžór Júlíus Björnsson.
The previous Finnish winner of the competition is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant boat M/S Tampere rushed on a karille in Pyhäjärvi - "Stirfully attached to the rock"
Inland waterway M/S Tampere was driving late Friday night in Akaa Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue unit received an alarm on a water traffic accident on Friday night after 6:30 p.m.
The 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has drifted to the track and is firmly attached to its bow on the rock, described by the firefighter Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members aboard.
According to the Rescue Department, personal injury was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they're being transferred by bus to Tampere, told Chief Jari Nieminen STT after 1:00 p.m. by his on-call friend.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viola to receive evacuated passengers.
The ship from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had for some reason drifted off its route to the west of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
The police will find out what happened.
The firefighter Matti Willman told me earlier in the evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult because of the darkness and a rather heavy wind.
According to the Rescue Department, the ship's fate is unclear.
I don't think the ship's leaking.
After the evacuation operation, the divers begin to check the situation at the bottom.
M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is now a restaurant vessel with a maximum authorised number of passengers of 180.
There shall also be a meeting room for private use on board.
According to the ship's website, cruisers have been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers are charging Robert Helenius for unpaid fees.
The boxer Robert Helenius tonight's fight against Erkan Teper is shadowing the money dispute.
In the evening, the boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and Deputy Judge Jussi Kokkila reported today on an application for a challenge, in which Helen's interest is charged a total of over EUR 80 000 for unpaid managers' fees.
According to the application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helen on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've been trying to compromise, but there's no other way.
There has been a clear mandate here, and the work has been done very much, says Kokkila to evening-Sanom.
Markus Sundman, Helen’s current manager, sent an answer to the evening magazine, explaining what happened to the boxer’s view.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the amount required.
According to his reply, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in a financially difficult situation to Helen and promised that they would be able to organise matches and sponsor's revenues for him.
Literally, it was agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay the prizes only as a percentage of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helen did not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they provided.
This is also a normal and only practice for professional athletes to manage.
Wage work has never been agreed and such would have been absurd in Helen’s situation, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to his reply, Heleny would have liked to have agreed on the distribution in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not have the draft until the end of 2014.
He found the proposal to be poor on his own and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Heleny did not fight once while dealing with Kokkila and Helminen.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helen had been assigned a "unidentified but massive" bill on the manager's work.
This year, the same claims have been made.
Helenius considers Helminen and Kokkila’s ex-post activities to be poor, the answer states.
Heleny is faced today with the boxing alliance at the seventh Erkan Teper Stuttgart, on the IBF's heavyweight competition list.
A Hearty Man and a Good Supplier
The entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio drunker and journalist Erkki Pälli for decades.
At the age of 83, Erkki Pälli died of unhealed liver cancer.
The host’s death report was published on Sunday in Helsingin Sanoma.
The report says Pälli died on September 3rd.
Pälli told about the serious illness on his Facebook pages in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was grieved by knowledge of the fate of the familiar.
He used to say goodbye on Facebook, like Ile Vainio says.
The division considers Erkki Päll to be a multi-talented expert who became a great journalist.
He reminds me that Päll was a kept person with fast hossots and funny things.
I got to know Erk as a little boy when I first went to the Finn album when I was 12.
Erk and I met at the time.
At the time, he was an informant of Finn's record and was in a different position, Ile Vainio recalls.
As I went on to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a standard journalist at all the parties doing stories about artists.
He was always competent and saw how great a fire he had for entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got right into the skin of those he was interviewing.
He was a kind man and a good journalist.
For many he became known as the respected Radio Leader of Yle, but he also wrote brilliant newspaper stories.
Erkki interviewed me several times.
He was good at talking, Vainio says.
Over the decades Pälli worked with Toi Kärje, Fazer label company, in addition to the press work.
He was the music producer on the records of Vesa-Matti Loir.
But Päll’s greatest passion was radio work, where he had a unique style.
He was doing radio work since the 1960s, and he became known to numerous audiences in Yle's ether.
He retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Union announced on Saturday that the financial year ended in May showed a profit of approximately EUR 450 000.
The Alliance describes the "full translation" of its economic situation, although the economy is being burdened by the "substantial debt on the balance sheet".
Mika Kulmala, CEO, commends rapid reaction and tight economic discipline.
We reacted as quickly as possible last autumn by taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning and economic management of the operation have been struck through our entire organization, Kulmala explains in the newsletter.
We have also succeeded well in partnering, and in addition, the world cups yield was maximum in the past competition period.
However, in the future, the management of costs must continue to be rigorous and, at the same time, we must continue to look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Tens of bodies lying in the back yard of the hospital, please, in the city of Indonesia, on the island of Sulawes.
Only one building separates them from the area where the injured are collected for assessment of the need for injury and treatment.
Patients are also treated outside due to post-surgical shocks.
One of the people who moved in the hospital area was a 52-year-old man named Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him when he was going to school, Baharuddin told the news agency AFP.
In the yard area of the army hospital in Palu, Dwi Haris was lying, who was injured in his back and arm.
He was at a local hotel with his wife and daughter when the quake began.
The family was invited to Paluu's wedding party.
I was probably hit by a wall that collapsed.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my kid.
I hope they're safe, and Haris told AP the news agency according to the British media.
Small stores are being robbed
At the evacuation center, please, 35-year-old little baby's mother, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm down her hot baby.
He described the moods in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, says Kusuma.
Many of the residents of please have slept outside or in temporary bamboo houses.
Even if the house is somehow upright, possible aftersurgents could destroy it permanently and bury the inhabitants under it.
According to the news agency AP, more than half of the prisoners in prison ran away after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there may be about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Dongala prison have also escaped, says The Jakarta Post.
According to the paper, the prisoners became angry and set the prison on fire after the guards had told them not to go looking for relatives suffering from an earthquake and tsunami.
Please note that the airport has been re-opened mainly for aid flights.
Among the first to arrive was an army C-130 transporter, which brought relief supplies.
Commercial flights Please allow only limited access to the airport.
The pilots will have to land at the airport without the help of air traffic control, as the air traffic control tower was badly damaged in an earthquake.
Rain wipes over Finland at night
A long rainy area spreads across the country on Sunday night, says the Department of Aeroscience.
The rain comes mostly as water, but in the Central and North Child it is expected to run or snow.
The last night’s blankets are not repeated, as under the cloud cover the temperatures remain higher.
The cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures quite effectively under control.
In the west, we can take a moment to the side of the sun, said my friend, meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainfall will pass eastwards along the morning.
In the south and west, there are vermin or half-clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures are moving up to the height of Oulu at 10-13 degrees.
The beginning of the week looks similar in terms of temperature in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather is becoming more unstable.
There are wind and wave warnings in maritime areas.
The actual autumn storms are not expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be varying weather in the typical autumn.
I mean, the fall is starting to get really serious right now, Ilkka said.

This year, there have been particularly many winners of the previous year's Miss Finland.
They are represented by Miss Jonna Ziprus in 1998.
Other representatives of the jury are Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO of Joun Kauppa Minttu Murphy-Kaulinen and News Producer Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping he'd get to college before he went to the Missives.
The Russian Dimitrian father and the Inkerian mother Svetlana believed in their daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
New Miss Alina Voronkova's parents Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova were proud to follow their daughter's first moments at the end of the crown.
They got into the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the finals.
It's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed Erika all the time, but half an hour before we got here, it got nervous, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Inkerian and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks Russian, although she has lived in Finland as a whole.
Svetlana says that when she was a kid, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than her career.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, she should become Miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio drunk.
It wasn't until later that Alina got excited about the beauty contests.
The parents' wish was for Alina to attend the university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
That's what happened, and in the end, Alina wanted to get her degree before the Missives.
We already asked him last year why he wasn't taking part, but he wanted to finish that heel.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because there is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He's got a lot of sports and a healthy meal.
And Alina likes to be on display, I can see it.
Alina's boyfriend, Joonas Hurri, is playing hockey in Japan, and he did not get to Finland to encourage love in the final.
Alina’s parents believe that young people’s relationship lasts for a Missive Year.
Yes, that's the point!
My parents wanted my daughter to be here soon.
Now it's been such a long break in visits because of the Missives.
I miss messages already.

Sari Pippo left his career in Brussels and became a home mother in Finland - thought of the idea of a cartoon: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
At one time, the animal bomb broke out of my husband's act, in which he proposed it as a person to the story I've developed, says Sari Piippo, the comic blogger, the mother of the home and former EU translator.
Sari Pippo reports that he was an EU translator in economic and legal affairs in Brussels until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I've had a really good time as a housewife.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me that what would be done when the smallest child was getting older.
Then 2014 came a comic book.
Piippo tells us that he had never dreamed of making a cartoon, even though he had read Aku Ankka, Tintti, and Asterix from a young age.
I had drawn the last time as a child, but when these manuscripts of the Beast began to be born, the situation changed.
At first I made a few dozen manuscripts in the desk box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled drafter, but I could not attract her until summer 2016 when I donated Viivi with the help of a drawing plate.
His zeal lasted a dozen stripes, and then he was forced to start trying for himself, laughing at Pippi, who says the drawing plate was a great encouragement to him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to make something early.
On paper I didn’t even try to draw, Pippi tells me about her relationship with drawing, which she usually does at night.
The manuscripts are always popping into my mind, but I usually don't make it all at once.
It takes up to several hours for a three-screen strip.
I might make a screen at a time and I'll be happy to play with the colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest, because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Pippo says that he appreciates Scott Adams Dilbert, among other things, from the modern - day series of newspapers.
The characters of the organic shell are a carrot-carroted mother who has a salad softness.
Other people are Man, Piss and Twins.
In the world of the wild, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from your own life and social media.
Sari Pippo doesn't want to preach or offer a coercion, even though he's intruding on the Beast sometimes.
Pippo says he'll read his series with his husband and children.
I mean, it's such a great feeling when you look at the comic book you're drawing and you realize that's what I've done today.
And there's plenty of challenges for my mother!

The Indonesian earthquake: The pilot sacrificed himself - did not leave a cracking tower until he secured hundreds of passengers.
A 21-year-old flight leader, Anthony Gunawan Agung, has become a hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung remained alone in the air traffic control tower until he could safely get hundreds of passenger planes off the island shaken by an earthquake.
The young man was in charge of the air traffic control of Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Please, when the earthquake struck Friday.
As others fled the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave before being piloted from the runway of Batik Air’s passenger plane to the air.
In this way he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian aviation administration told AFP.
Mutira SIS Al-Jufrie Airport Saturday after the earthquake.
The flight control tower was shaking and cracking.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke and he suffered severe internal organ damage.
Agung was sent to a nearby hospital.
He was supposed to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he passed away 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, the aeronautical representative told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to increase after the flight got into the air, and its intensity was finally measured at 7,5 magnetites.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian aviation administration has respected Agung's heroism in social media.
Rehn thought about the end of Europe's trade war: "We must look at the following tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated all over Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
President Olli Rehn said in Yle's first column that even though the tightening tension does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn reflects the investment decisions of companies.
The situation also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
In Rehn's view, Europe is, for the time being, a very good mince.
It has been able to build an intermediate peace with the United States and contributed to calming the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be grinding into the feet of the trade war.
We'll have to look at the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner on the way to Washington, but he said in the interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest national economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most debtor countries in the euro area and in the Western world.
The market reacted harshly yesterday Thursday night to the budget deficit presented by the Italian Government.
Next year's deficit is more than 2.4% of the population's product.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country's loan portfolio is problem loans and more than ten per cent of unsecuritised loans.
In addition, its public finances are in a weak position and the country seems to be once again beyond its commitment to its European partners.
Perhaps it is not worth painting new crises, Mr Rehn replied when he was asked whether Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another issue that is affecting Europe is the difference between Britain and the EU.
Rehn was hoping it would work out.
The difference would have far more negative effects.
Rehn started as Governor of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, Director-General of the European Central Bank (ECB), will withdraw from office in just a year's time.
The debate on his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor, Erkki Liikanen, have been dazzling in speeches.
I'm sure it's okay if Finnish names are involved, Rehn said and added that he's not going to comment further.
The super-popular Black Box performances of HS will continue again next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are for sale
The popular Black Box presentations organised by Helsingin Sanoma will continue again in the beginning of the week.
Other presentations will be seen at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
23 October The Black Box will visit the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets to the National Theatre for sale.
The Tampere show has been sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers on the stage will tell a long-prepared true story, which has not previously been published in any HS tool.
There's something with it that no one's ever heard before.
"There is a strange spy at night in Helsinki, an impressive report on the other side of the world and a conversational story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet the HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has organised the evenings of living journalism for three years.
They have been popular since the beginning and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already visited the room.
The black box was awarded in the Bonnier Gala as a year of journalistic action.
The prize winners thanked the new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
Spring season 2019 The black box will be seen in the National Theatre in March-April.
The performance will also be visited in Tampere and Turku.
The presentation at that time has a different content than in this autumn’s evening.
The missing fungus was found by the "premisesless experiment"
Finnish police drone know-how is the top of the world: "We are being asked about training"
According to the head of the Police College of Applied Sciences, the police may use drones, in addition to missing persons, for example in crime investigation and intelligence.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find the drone that disappeared in Raahe in just a few minutes.
Director Kimmo Himberg of the University of Police College of Applied Sciences referred to the case and mentioned, among other things, that "with unprejudiced experiment and effective training, we are also the world's top priority here".
Drone's a pretty new coup, and he's more recent than that.
There are no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police would be the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been survived, for example, when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported in international events.
There's a lot of interest in that somewhere else, says Himberg.
There would be a great deal of pressure on visitors to see the drone activities of the Finnish police.
We're being asked for training.
More and more
Hemberg points out that it is very important to find a missing person in winter conditions in Finland as soon as possible.
As has been said, in Raahe’s case, a drone was found only in a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg says they're supposed to be trained more.
The use of drones in police duties is already high and their use will become more widespread and increased in the future.
That's what I'd dare say, Himberg tells me.
In addition to searching for missing persons, according to Himberg, the police may use drones in, for example, accident or crime scene investigations and certain types of intelligence activities.
For example, we already need to check some area a little further, where it is possible to fear that violence will be faced there.
Drone can then be used for prior consultation.
Karelian Rugby went to D.O.I.
Karelian Rugby celebrated the victory of the 2nd Division in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuns were still in the middle of the match with 7-12 losses to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a plot in the second period and whispered the southern guests 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew Karelian Rugby's historic rise to the 1-division.
In the past, the club has played in the first place, but at the time the Finnish rugby series was divided into two levels, the MS series and the multi-partial 1-division.
The club is going to take a serial spot, but it knows a lot of work next winter.
The current roster of less than twenty players must be raised to 25.
The 1-division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer game trips, so the fund-raising must also be in line with it.
The Eagle Peninsula starts the season in Montreal, confirms the head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of the Montreal Canadiens at the hockey club NHL, confirmed the company’s Twitter account that the Finnish prodigal Jesper Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super promise in Kotkaniemi, 18th round with a number of three for the summer reservation.
The attacker joined Montreal's training force from the end of the summer and has presented strong extracts in the September training matches.
In his first training game, the Eagleniemi managed to score.
The main coach Julien said that she had taken a major development step after she arrived at the New Year's camp.
The NHL’s regular series starts next week’s Thursday night in Finnish time.
Montreal will meet Toronto Maple Leafs on the opening round.
What's a good leader like?
A lot has been said about leadership this week in Finland.
Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of the Nokian Government, told in an interview with HS of his book Paranod, an optimist in which he illuminates his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but previous Nokia studies have also discussed the inability of leaders to act as a team; fear and incontinence, which in turn caused the collapse of mobile phone business.
The risk-taking capacity and agility of the company's rising phase disappeared.
During the week in Helsinki, the Nordic Business Forum was also held, which drew the Finnish business cream to Messukeskus.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 stars of the business world rose to the stage.
That's enough talking about good leadership.
Gary Hamel, the legend of management doctrines, said that a good leader must have the courage to take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that those who are most emotionally involved in past decisions make decisions.
John Mackey, the founder of a wide range of organic food stores, said that the manager must be able to communicate to the entire staff for the purpose of the company.
And that can't be just making a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about the introverts in the book of success, reported that the most successful leaders have been examined to be humble.
They act calmly, quietly and decisively.
Often they're introverts.
Aswath Damodara, Professor of Finance, recalled that the characteristics of a good manager must be matched by the life cycle of the company.
At the beginning of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the company's future is based.
A mature company needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These are the teachings of the Nordic Business Forum that listened to 7,500 visitors - mostly Finnish leaders.
The danger was that they had an information wave.
A lot is required of a good leader.
That is why leadership is so often wrong, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They used to talk to each other in the scenes.
But they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And it was not easy for an outsider to judge their humility.
Sara Chafak arrived on a fantastic red carpet directly from Los Angeles to spend most of her year abroad.
The model Sara Chafak arrived at the Missive in a wonderful black dress.
In 2012, Miss Finland's spectacular dress also had a lace valley.
A little bit of Jet Law.
I'm back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me what he's been doing.
Chafak tells me he's in Los Angeles for the auditions.
Among other things, he's done ads.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, as he does in Finland.
True, he says that work needs to be done harder, as the model can always be replaced.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors 30,000 Euros live art award in Kuopio
The artist Sonya Lindfors won a prize worth 30 000 euros on Saturday in Kuopio.
Lindfors, who received the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, is working on choreography, social activity and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors's art is vital to her surroundings.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments that they have previously been lacking, the framework described the winner.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were awarded the prize.
The award is awarded annually to a live art artist or group operating in the field.
The Danish police found the big Volvo they were looking for in the operation, "We can't tell you what."
The extensive search for the Danish police has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the bridges of the Jewish Iron and Great Belt.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Själlanni was closed to Sweden, Germany and other Denmark.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached out to the head of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
We've found the car we're looking for.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet. Henry Storm from Copenhagen's police informs Ilta-Sanom.
According to Storm, the black Volvo you're looking for has no direct connection to the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
The Danish, Extra Bladet, told me about the police briefing on Saturday.
Chief of Investigation Jørgen Bergen Skov was a silent operation.
He didn't want to tell me what criminal code was used to investigate the case.
Skov said, however, that this is a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people's lives.
There's been a search for three people in the operation.
The police won't tell us if they've already been arrested.
According to the paper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
Copenhagen Police also watched events with their Twitter account.
The STT reports, however, that according to the police, the general public no longer has cause for concern, as certain people were threatened.
The name of Macedonia has led to a decade of dissociation - now the people are voting on this in the controversial elections.
In the Balkans, Macedonia is currently voting on a proposal for a new name.
According to the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek Governments, the name would be the Republic of North Macedonia.
To date, Greece has, with its veto right, blocked Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonian belongs to its northern province.
The question of referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voters are in favour of Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO by accepting the agreement.
The vote began slowly, at least at the school in the centre of Skopje, the capital.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, wished support for the agreement.
The referendum will mean change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
That means change especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) was officially used as an independent country.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the adoption of the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for the boycott of a referendum.
In addition to the result, it is exciting to see whether there is an increase in the number of votes above the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of the yes vote would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
The amendment of the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The Greek Parliament must also accept the agreement.
The polling stations close at 8:00 p.m. Finnish time.
That's a great victory!
Robert Helenius struck Erkan Teper
On Saturday night Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper's heavy series in a professional boxing match in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finn took a measure of his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, near Stuttgart.
The main match of the evening was the Intercontinental match of the heavy series of the IBF.
Its winners may be given the opportunity to fight harder tasks than they saw on Saturday, whose economic significance is significant.
Heleny solved the match in the eighth round, when he struck Teper with his hard left hand.
Teper couldn't get off the floor anymore.
The "Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent in the third round, when the German nose started to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to fight already in December 2015.
That's when Teper appealed to the injury and withdrew from the match.
After that, it turned out that the German had been loaded twice in a doping test.
Heleny has taken 28 matches and two defeats for her professional career.
Teper, who has gone to the game as a clear favourite, has won 19 professional matches and lost three times.
With Hamilton's stable order to win - the difference I've already lost 50 points
The Formula 1 championship was yet again approaching its assurance, as Mercedes Lewis Hamilton won the Russian gp and stretched its MM-line to Ferrari Sebastian Vettelli to 50 points (306-256).
There's only five more games left.
The Valter Bottas who left the stakeout of the race drove second.
Last year in Sochi, Bottas took his career as an opening winner, held the lead in the middle of the race, but Mercedes told me to get past Botta Hamilton.
Vettel drove third, Ferrari's Kimi Räikköne fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who started from the last line of departure, was the fifth.
The two of them assaulted a man in Joensuu... caught a block away.
Two men assaulted and kicked a 31-year-old Jewish man in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6 p.m.
According to the police, men also picked up the victim's phone.
The police reached out to the suspects, i.e. a 32-year-old male in haywater, and a 39-year-old male in a mermaid, soon after the event.
They were arrested as suspects of robbery, the police will tell us.
The victim was injured, which did not require medical attention.
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company Tesla, leaves his duties as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company.
Musk has agreed with the US authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been ordered to pay a fine of 20 million dollars to ensure that he has financed Tesla's withdrawal from the stock market.
The US Securities Commission, SEC, has accused Muski of security fraud.
Musk will continue as CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay fines of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada Fights Time To Reconciliate with the United States
The time is running out in the middle of the negotiations between the United States and Canada on the free trade agreement with Nafta.
The United States has set the back line for Sunday and the country's negotiators have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's main adviser, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
On the demand of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico started negotiations about a year ago on the reform of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring this agreement into force before the successful Mexican presidential elections, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, takes office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that it is not necessary for Canada to participate in the agreement.
He has previously informed Congress that the plans are to sign a contract at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the Agreement between the United States and Canada should be prepared on Sunday in order to allow sufficient time for the US Congress to assess it.
The neighbor thought the candles were set on fire in Kaakuri, the fire department was alerted.
The candles burned in the apartment building in Kaakkuri in Oulu caused a fire alarm on Sunday night.
A dozen rescue units were alerted because of a possible fire in the apartment building.
There it turned out that candles burned in the sauna of the apartment building had looked like a fire in the opposite house, so the emergency center had been notified.
There was no fire on the target.
The police picked up 11 people after the Honka-HJK match... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Following the Honka-HJK game of the Men's League in Espoo, 11 people were captured by the police on Saturday, and Teemu Värtinen confirmed to the STT by the Police Commissioner of the Western Uusimaa Police Department.
The reason for this was to protect against crime and disorder.
The prisoners were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
Previously on "The Night Sanomat"...
The fight ended between 0 and 0.
After the end of the week, a large number of viewers stormed the field from the scene reserved for HJK’s supporters.
The situation led to push and fist fights between team supporters.
In order to put an end to the situation, it took, among other things, horse police.
In addition to the field, there was a riot in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the arrests also took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw in the pictures was an unpleasant situation, Värtinen referred to the blasphemy in the field.
According to colour, no criminal reports have been made as a result of the events.
The table stone hastened the butterfly spray in the world cup of its SE time, Laukkanen also swims into the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Table Stone have advanced to the finals on the final day of the 3/7 World Cup competitions in the Netherlands.
They're swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
The HSS Tablestone hassled Finland's record at a 50-metre butterfly, where he was the second of the elements in 22.82.
Previously in September, Pöytakivi swims in Helsinki on a trip to the SE-era 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing the Espoo Cetus, was the 24th butterfly in 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatin Laukkanen was at the beginning of a 50-metre breast swim in the sixth time of 30.48 and went to the finals.
In the beginning of the two hundred meters of mixed swimming, Laukkanen was the 15th at 2.14.25.
Students act with rare taste: ancient tragedy - reduced Orestia affects their visuality
Tragedy in ancient history is rare in Finnish scenes.
For example, the National Theatre has recently seen the tragedy of ancient Sophocleen Filoctetes, in 1988.
Now the Academy of Theatre brought to the tour of the National Theatre the only preserved play trilogy, the Orestea of Aishhylos.
In the start of 2015 the Actor Students of Theatre University will work together with the professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
His international premiere was awarded to Orestia in Berlin in April.
Reconciliation from Orestia summarises the story of the end of the blood veneration of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law to twenty minutes, in particular by tightening up the chorus.
The work succeeds in being very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsupus (2003).
The display of dramatic lights and the pages of the theatre space emphasizes a simple and bright sense of scenery.
At its centre is the dynamics between performers who leave the choir alternately and those who play the roles, and the choir.
The presentation uses both double and triple seats for roll-outs.
Actors do not leave the scene at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon, who is returning from the Trojan War, and Kassandra, who are seen on the stage, as was the case in ancient performance tradition.
Of course, the performance does not stress its loyalty to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created in front of the viewer’s eyes, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to get out of the master’s stage as a close group, directly as a single organism, a band of performers.
Especially in choir parts, actors who are very expressive, sculptively inclined to group formations will be able to access their rights on the naked stage, only by decorating the white curtain, on the stage.
That's impressive.
The Orestea performance tour continues at Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures his first hydrogen truck
In particular, the new European cooperation agreement with Hyindai and the Swiss H2 Energy is beginning to show up.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the Hannover IAAA, Hyundai will provide the new model of a thousand cars for the use of the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing on the market the fuel cell truck Hyundai will continue as a hydrogen car manufacturer in Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models.
With this first project in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by following the development of the refuelling network, said In Cheol Lee, Vice President of Hyundai Motor, in the terms of publication of the contract.
The fists whistled several times in Kajaan
A man in his late 30 ’ s assaulted three men at a restaurant in central Kajaan and outside it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit a man inside the restaurant, and as a result he was removed.
Outside, he pushed another man into the ground, and when the third man intervened, the abuser still hit him.
The police picked up the assailant.
At the police station, the man continued to act aggressively and kicked another cop in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to jail to calm down.
Three cases of abuse and violent opposition are being investigated.
In the middle of Kajaan, there was also another incident of abuse on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, about 20-year-old Kajaan man hit the victim.
A little later, another man poured him to the ground, and the man who hit him in the past was still kicking the victim.
The outsiders pulled the attackers away from the victim and the police were called.
But the people who did it had time to leave before the police arrived.
The police are asking the witnesses of the event to contact the Kajaani police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at tutkimus.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Long line radio host Erkki Pälli is dead
Erkki Pälli, well-known as a long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio Leader Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of unhealed liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook pages in March 2018.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Even the doctor has said that, I live a day at a time, he commented on his situation in the evening magazine a month ago.
The safety of aunts and uncles must be guaranteed.
For the first time, I got paid in 1984.
When one of these annual tyres is amazed by something, it is usually the big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and occasionally even somewhat angry.
I also spoke about the issue of Erika Käärä, an environmental expert from the Trade Union for Services (PAM).
He says that crime statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, claim otherwise.
The police are only aware of cases that are clearly serious, and many of the real violent situations remain unreported.
"Of course, companies have an obligation to statistics their close-up situation on the basis of the Safety Act, but these statistics remain internal and do not collect their data anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries don't end up in statistics.
In situations of violence, the problem has always been that they do not always result in physical injury.
Even so, mental traumas can be much more serious than bruising and wounds.
The difference between the situation of violence and the threatening situation is difficult to draw when an aggressive threat of a certain level has to be counted as violence, even if it is not.
Too many people are afraid at work, even though the actual action is not happening.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store's got guards.
Even when the opening hours of the shops were released, there was quite a great deal of steam in the media about its impact on the safety of the sellers.
"At that time, many employers arranged security services for at least night-time hours and to prevent work alone," says Käärää.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When, due to security, the situation of the disturbance remained well under control, there was a feeling that security would be unnecessary.
Now many places are trying to find solutions that could remove expensive security services.
Mild abuse is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that the seller who has been abused does not want to make a request for an investigation into a criminal who usually lives nearby.
However, according to the same point of law as set out in 2011, mild abuse will become subject to the prosecution if it occurs at the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle is being abused, the police should investigate and the prosecution should.
When a court put a few offenders in prison, and a sentence for the harsh end of the penalty scale, the manners would be tidy.
A society where the grocery store must be open in small towns almost nights, must guarantee the safety of workers.
Heidi Sohlberg signed to Miss before the launch of the live broadcast, "Sara, Iiro is married."
Missi's crowning is not seen in the traditional way on TV this year, but is shown on the Viafree website.
The broadcast is run by former Miss Heidi Sohlberg and the host of the NHL and KHL studios of Viasat and Viaplay Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet lead by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host trio told the invited guests and representatives of the media that the broadcast had taken place.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula fresh applause.
Now all the women scream!
Now look at this man-in-law of ours, Sohlberg vehemently cheered up his colleague while the audience was cheering.
Many of the previous years are followed by Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to each other and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg locked up looking at Saras.
The more likely Sohlberg referred to the recently divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, although at first he seemed confused.
This is the first time that the rapper has spoken of his resignation in the newspaper of the weekend of the Evening-Sanomi.
Missikaunotar said that he did not want to open up the reasons for the divorce more precisely in the public, because it is a matter between him and Roope Salminen.
He said that he was not in a hurry to have a new relationship. He was going to focus on himself.
I'm focused on my own stuff, and especially I'm starting to live my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
The status of Harjula’s marriage became apparent at a later stage when Sohlberg was accidentally wrong to call Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The host three laughed at me.
I mean, I was married, wasn't I? How did it go?
Janni Hussi took over.
The Northman tortured his tied wife by cutting, burning and feeding a powerful sauce.
The North County District Court has sentenced a 34-year-old man to three years in prison for numerous crimes against his common-law spouses.
Among other things, the crime weapon was the belt, cable and girdles.
The court ruled that the goods in question were lost to the State.
The most serious charge was the assault of a suspect.
However, the district court rejected this charge.
Four abuses, gross assault, coercion, illegal threat, deprivation of liberty, gross deprivation of liberty and two acts of harm were considered to be the fault of the Kokkolan.
Crimes occurred between 26 March and 24 May last year.
At the end of the last act, the man was captured and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the Northland District Court issued its judgment and ordered the 34-year-old to continue to be held in the prisoners of Vaasa.
No evidence of rape
A 34-year-old was also accused of two gross deprivation of liberty and of gross rape on 22 May.
However, these accusations were rejected by the court as unseen.
The case was dealt with in court behind closed doors.
However, the District Court issued a public statement of the judgment.
According to the district judge, the defendant had directed violence, threats, and coercion against his spouse in situations where he had been bound.
The defendant cut his victim with a knife, smoked with a cigarette, fed a powerful sauce, poured water, and poured coffee on him.
In its judgment, the court ordered the State to lose its means of crime: belt and cable, girdles, bathrobe belt, knife and toilet.
Four Witnesses
According to district law, the parties continued to live together.
It is clear from the judgment that a large part of the most serious acts occurred at the end of the criminal period.
Four witnesses, two women, and two men were heard in court.
The victim’s 34-year-old must pay a total of EUR 5800 for pain, pain, suffering and temporary harm.
He hardly has such money, for the convicted already have debts in the inheritance.
The prison sentence is not the man's first.
The evening paper does not state the name of the convicted person to protect the victim's privacy.
The recent district court ruling is not legally valid when writing this.
Europe led by four points to the Ryder Cup solution
On Saturday, European golf professionals captured their lead in a traditional hole game against the United States.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup on 10-6, which will be played in Paris on Sunday, while twelve games will still be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four ball games that started on Saturday, and in the four games this afternoon the winnings were equal to 2-2.
European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches he played as a pair on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couples had reached the same level.
On Sunday, the two of us will seek more history.
No European player has won five points in the Ryder Cup together, and none of the Americans have reached more than three: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the fierce harassment of its supporters in the Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
On Sunday, HJK, the football betting team, published a release condemning the interference behaviour of its supporters in the FC Honka game on Saturday in Tapiola.
"We apologize for the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the newsletter states.
At the end of the fight, about 50 HJK supporters stormed the field and some seemed to be trying to challenge Honga’s supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organizers did not calm down the situation, but needed police and horsemen.
HJK reports in his release that the team’s players and staff are shocked by what happened.
The events after the fight are not in line with the values of our 111-year-old society.
"We strongly withdraw from any action that endangers the safety of match events", states the press release.
The HJK promises to assist authorities and event organisers in identifying safety threats and eliminating mild phenomena.
Support culture is part of football and important to HJK.
We support in every way positive, joyous and stimulating activities in football.
"Violence is not part of it," says the press release.
A Filipino inventor flies a drone car to avoid traffic congestion.
Mendila is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer, and some kind of pelle fearless.
He is now part of a growing group in the world who swears to have invented a flying car, or at least their own version of it.
As competitors, for example, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendila does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, a man has used a great deal of his assets to build his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he's calling the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he's done the first successful test flight... he's sailed his device at an altitude of over seven metres.
One of his objectives was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope that the device gives rise to positive reactions.
It was just a dream five years ago, and Mendiola said it was British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts that tomorrow's labour struggles will be visible in day care and social and health services for children
In the public and welfare sectors, overtime and exchange bans begin tomorrow, especially in social and health services and day care for children, evaluates Päivi Niemi-Laine, Chairman of JHL.
The effects will be wide and will certainly be visible in such a way that there is not enough staff on the ground.
Everyone's gonna have to think about how to pick up their kids.
It is now up to the employer to ensure that the services play and that no one's life is threatened, says Niemi-Laine to the STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of workers was also visible at the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned from working overtime and exchange due to contractual negotiations.
Through flexibility, employers have made it possible for staff not to be employed, but for workers to be overworked or to change shifts.
This isn't a job struggle yet.
It is quite normal in terms of occupational safety that regular working hours are taken care of and only done for each worker.
JHL is opposed to the government's intention to reduce the protection of small companies' dismissals.
Markku Jalonen, Labour Market Manager of municipal employers, will not make a prior assessment of the impact of overtime and exchange bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may deteriorate.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be made.
The area is so vast, social and health care and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The effects may vary greatly by industry, region and employer, Jalonen said to the STT.
Jalonen says that last week we already had experience of the corresponding three-day activities carried out by, amongst others, Super and the Social and Health Trade Union.
Their effects were rather limited.
JHL's overtime and exchange ban applies, inter alia, to municipal, church, state and private social and health workers.
Family day care providers, for example, are excluded.
At this stage, almost 100 000 JHL members are affected by the fight at work.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL may take a long time.
The Alliance is also prepared for other labour combat activities if the law of dismissal continues to be prepared.
The government should now admit that this is where we run to the wall and hard.
He felt that both the Ay movement and the government had to meet.
What's special here is that the tough ones are already in the pipe, even though the show hasn't been given yet, Jalonen is updating.
A large coral rhinestone is born with the strength of children and adults - in the fitness circles of the show, studying the gestures of the rascal and the sea horse
In other spaces, the Great Coral Rite was premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like previous works of the group, the Great Coral Riut is a work that is built from the beginning to the end with the audience.
However, this time a clearer presentation will also be built, which will refresh and crystallize the observations made in the initial exercises.
There's a lot of fairytale magic in the theatre play for the kids.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparation phase of the work.
However, the Great Coral Reef is not a children’s performance, but a performance performed by adults and children in co-operation.
It provides adults with information and observations on the way in which children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into exercises and joint games also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
The great coral reef is somewhat similar to a fairy ball, a fitness circle and a natural-related information strike, but it is finally tuned around visits in different, non-human conditions.
The large coral reef begins with the introduction of corals and coral reefs.
Among other things, six different fitness districts learn the gestures of rascal and sea horse.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour will be performed where music, lights, and shiny paints and costumes will help you to get to know the life of the coral reef.
There are both divers in the great coral reef who observe the life of the coral reef and the corals that are examined.
In addition, there are organisms that look at corals.
Looks and observations in many directions make the performance dense and full of life.
Whether there is a landscape of an organism, an organism that looks at the landscape, or another organism that looks at the organism, or a landscape, and all at the same time.
It doesn't seem difficult for children.
In other areas, the group aims at the limit of thinking and action, which is challenging when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, Sitrator will hold a silent demonstration on behalf of endangered corals.
Disasters beyond human understanding should not be allowed to harden, even if it could be difficult to understand the significance of exercising one’s compassion in the face of destruction.
In other places, it has built its work in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also through political movement.
There are other generations, there are different kinds of consciousness, other species, and their future generations, for whose wonders and games it clears the space.
Kids grow up too fast. I'm glad I didn't have any smartphones when I was a kid.
Children and young people today are more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time when they are younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess up their lives because of drugs and sex, because others say they do.
I was embarrassed when my friend told me he had to pick up his sister in the fifth grade at the "boy"'s house this weekend.
When she came to get her drunk sister, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
There is no way I could imagine my own sister in the same situation because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that drugs should not be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today’s children will be able to live a decent childhood, and they do not need to grow up because of the group pressure created by friends too early.
I keep seeing girls who are younger and younger in Instagram, who are pictured with makeup in their faces and who are wearing clothes.
Snapchat is used to take and send photos that reveal at night.
It's more difficult for girls to guess what age they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look 18 years old and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't have smart phones when I was a kid.
I had to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what other people thought of me.
YLE: Authorities told the government that the case did not concern national security in the case of Airisto Helmi
According to Ilkka Kanerva, who was interviewed by Ilkka Kanerva, the Defence Police and Defence Forces came to inform the Defence and Foreign Affairs committees earlier this week.
The Finnish state administration has been informed that the investigation by Airisto Helme does not currently have to do with national security, but with organised crime, reports Yle.
The information on anonymous sources was confirmed by Ilkka Kanerva (cok), Chairman of the Defence Committee.
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Defence Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered to be economic crime.
They were quite strict about the fact that they were not speculating that there was anything else here, Kanerva commented in the Yle interview.
According to information, no evidence has so far been found of a link to national security, but the investigation is only under way.
There is no way to know what can be revealed, one of Yle’s interviews says.
A week ago, large-scale search for homes in the Turku archipelago and the mainland has raised the question of whether the investigation is a mere economic crime or a threat to internal security in Finland.
This evening’s paper was produced earlier this week by a case in which claims are examined both in favour and against.
Video: The dream painting saved Liverpool's lost series
The start of Liverpool’s 100% Valioliiga was completed, but it was still a more satisfied team for 1-1 level playing on Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday it will be exactly a year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away to a 1-0 guest victory.
That's when the Pep Guardiola combination sent out a signal to all of Valoliga that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool's manager Järgen Klopp arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Reds had begun Valoliiga with six consecutive victorys.
Liverpool began stronger, and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to control his own field after his own end.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a great tour of Anfield Road on Wednesday.
That's when Eden Handd got up from the exchange bench to solve the match with a great individual performance.
Now, of course, Homer was there right from the beginning.
In 25 minutes, he first played in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally, the Croat saw Haard rush forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
He got a little on the edge of the penalty zone, but he bombed a perfect left foot in the back corner of the bet.
Pool's brassi guard, Alisson, was a little slow in his fight and didn't get his finger on the ball.
Klopp must have felt the position of defeat slightly unfair, since almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger cleared the finish line of Mo Salah’s direction.
In the second episode, Chelsea's Veskar Kepa was able to get to the point.
The Basque guard reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the top to the corner.
At the other end, Alisson zeroed his throw-in through the Haard drive.
The best place for guests came in 72 minutes when James Milner found his focus on Bobby Firmino.
But the Brassi star bull was heading toward David Luiz, a country teammate, who saved the master’s leadership.
It could not take more than 89 minutes to get Daniel Sturridge, the exchanger, free to shoot 25 meters.
Sturridge played with his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it in honor of an irresistable bet on the upper corner.
Liverpool's 100% league was completed with a 1-1 cable, but it's still in the lead, together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also firmly involved in the championship two points behind the tip.
In a clock transfer conversation, the pots are deep
I remember a few decades ago, a magazine asked different Finnish influences, which divides the Finnish people.
Juice Widow's answer was the only thing I remember: the Nen terminal.
Some have a no-no end and some don't.
I mean, there's a lot of divide lines that can be born anywhere, and here's one offer.
In the EU, Finland has led to the abandonment of annual clock movements.
Many agree that the shifting of clocks twice a year has been the work of fools and has caused a wide range of problems.
Finally, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage in the solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The hardest thing is now to solve what time it will end at: the current summer or winter time or another time zone.
This also allows people to express their views on the otakanta.fi page.
The questionnaire has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open until Friday 12 October.
There is a heated debate on coffee tables and social media, and everyone has a word to say.
Those who defend wintertime justify their position by using morning light to protect people's well-being and summertime by the influence of evening light on people's desire for outdoors and thus on well-being.
Both have strong supporters and good arguments.
Even studies show that morning light beats a person's day and gives him a break.
On the other hand, if there is no particular need to wake up in the dark, the light will increase the movement of people outside and give better opportunities, for example, for autumn gardens.
The amount of additional light after the normal working day has already been calculated in its class.
I'd prefer to take both, but unfortunately, we're located in the north of the planet.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many anyway.
It is typical for the debate on the subject to be driven and the views of the other are very strongly opposed.
The arguments of the opponent are hardly heard, because the most important thing is how you feel.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is not in vain to try to turn the other person’s head.
It's burning to waste.
The subject is an extremely easy debate, because it does not require a great deal of attention and there is sufficient evidence to justify it.
In general, similar things are debated more harshly and equally infertile.
I'm sorry if the wrong option gets chosen, but I'm sure you'll adapt to that.
And it always provides a suitable scapegoat if life feels open.
And he fought for the victory of the wreath.
The first guest game in the Salibandy Divar produced three full serial points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left the Seinäjoki River for a joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory with him.
The Nurmo still led the goal at the beginning of the third batch, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In time 50.47 brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5-win goal.
As both teams freezed, decisive minutes were played in the plateau.
Jouso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was fiery anyway, when Teemu Cinderella (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Mika Kosonenski (1+0) also played in the 2nd chain at the time of birth.
After three rounds, he's got six points.
Next, O2-Jyväskylä will meet you in two weeks' time.
At my uncle's church Sunday, 200th anniversary
The 200th anniversary of the Eno Church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday in very sad atmospheres.
A week ago, the arson of the Church of Aggravation was a shock.
Even the uncle’s church was guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, there's still a place for the party today.
Although no one would like that, the Church of Eno is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Congregation.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite the municipal and other associations of all the world.
The family fair starts at the Eno church today at 10:00.
Then we move on to the parish house at the shepherd’s feast table.
There's a lot of stuff in the program all day, both inside and out.
For example, you can find out about the church building under the guidance of Ari Räsänen, who retired for 37 years.
The celebration of the church’s birth also marks the end of one era.
The church house, which was built in 1982, is already in use, will open its doors for the last time today.
Now we're in the outpost in the former municipal building," says Kappa Markku Koistinen.
The parish house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing still for 200 years.
Elon Musk will resign from the position of President of Tesla's government, and the charges of fraud will be settled for $40 million.
Tesla, the electric car manufacturer and Elon Musk, the CEO of the company, have settled their case with the U.S. Securities Regulatory Authority (SEC).
The SEC suspected that Musk had committed a security fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined by the company he had set up.
However, Musk may continue as CEO of Tesla.
On the other hand, Musk is forced to withdraw from the seat of President of the Tesla Government for three years.
The company will have to hire the chairman of an outside government.
The muscle is also subject to tighter control.
According to the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent directors and monitor Musk's communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk both pay $20 million (about EUR 17 million) to reconcile the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market failures and the harm to Tesla shareholders," says Director Steven Peikin of SEC.
The case started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company off the market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding has been secured.
The receipt of the receipt of the receipt of the receipt of a letter of formal notice to the Tesla Group of Experts, the receipt of a letter of formal notice, the receipt of a letter of formal notice from the Commission, the receipt of a letter of formal notice from the
The SEC suspected that Musk was guilty of security fraud.
According to the Agency, the TV was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with any other company's management or potential funders.
In practice, the agency accused Muski of misleading investors.
The SEC announced on Friday that it would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC stated that it claimed that Musk would be fined and that he would no longer be held by listed companies.
The SEC’s challenge frightened investors, and Tesla’s share went into a strong decline.
More than 800 people died in the Indonesian quake and tsunami
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and the subsequent tsunamis has risen to at least 832, reports the country’s Agency for Disaster according to AFP.
The number of deaths is still expected to increase, as destruction is pending.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may rise to thousands.
The Friday earthquake raised the tsunami that attacked the town of Please, on the island of Sulawes.
A warning was given immediately after the quake, but this was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are from Palus at least for the time being.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the region of Dongala near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Even now, a number of people are known to have died.
The ruins of requests for help
The Indonesian army has been alarmed to help rescue workers seek victims.
President Widodon, who arrived in the destruction zone today, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue without wearing out day and night.
One of the centers of the rescue is the hotel in Palu, which is still believed to have between 50 and 60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the Agency for Rescue, said that one person was dug out of the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel, which was popular for business travelers.
We also heard people's requests for help, he told us.
According to Syaug, heavy excavating equipment would be quickly needed in the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their loved ones who are missing.
Help me, you're in and out of town.
My friend's family is still missing, a writer appealed to the Facebook group.
The phone of politicians leaked into the hands of distractions in Britain
Many British politicians were disturbed when their contact information was leaked because of the shortcomings in the application.
Among other things, the troublemakers had access to the ministers’ telephone numbers.
This was an application used at the British Conservative Party Conference in the Government.
For example, Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Development Michael Gove and former Minister for Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson were subject to harassment.
Several Members of the House received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption of the application, the public was able to access the profile of politicians who were in the mobile application of the Conservative Party's annual meeting.
The audience had access to the profiles by using the politicians' email address, which was easily available online.
The profile log was able to view and edit the data stored in the profile.
Someone managed to turn Boris Johnson into a profile picture of porn and title for a moment.
Michael Goven's profile was replaced by a picture of the media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows you to log into other people’s profiles with these email addresses.
Then the login person can view the contact information of the profile person and send messages in its name.
The meeting application made the telephone number of each journalist, politician and participant public, Foster criticised.
The Conservative Party informant apologized to the leak of information.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and that the application is now working safely.
The ICO is supported by the British information authority.
The application was prepared by the Australian Crown Comms company.
The Labour Party in the opposition criticises the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The audience of The Wall Finland has a large number of popular Poles every week
Watchful viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience in The Wall Finland.
The United States format The Wall, which was rapidly spreading around the world, landed on the Finnish version of the Four last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen is filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are carried out.
In the Polish studio, the opportunity to describe was exceptional, as the format’s large 12 metres high gaming wall required space from the farm.
During the start-up period, the social media raised the audience of the programme, which was thought to be Polish.
On Twitter, there would be a debate on whether the Polish people in the studio might understand anything about the game to be played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, head of the four domestic programmes, will illustrate this to the evening magazine.
He says that the studio audience has players who are close, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, and only Polish viewers.
The audience consists of international tapists in Finnish production, just as the audiences of the The Wall episodes described in other countries in the same production space.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who visit the different programme descriptions, and Sormune is behind it.
He recalls that following the game in itself is not so difficult to understand, even if he does not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green falling balls are easy to distinguish.
However, there are interpreters in the studio who carry out the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret events as a simulant interpretation for the studio director.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells us what kind of a laptop is thrown there, for example, and what is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with that of David Hasselhoff in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was present a few years ago in Talent's Finnish descriptions in Finland.
He always had a simulant interpretation in his ear, and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish, the sum of the Ring.
The arthropod in the southern parts of Japan is moving towards the main island - the authorities are warning of landslides and floods
The authorities also warn against possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured by the Taifoon Tram, but the authorities say that large injuries have been avoided and that no information has yet been available on the deaths.
In the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so heavy that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK broadcasting company, people have been evacuated to shelters and electricity has been cut off from over 300 000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and the pilot trains are in place to stop because of the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka in half a day's time.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the path of the storm, but there are also strong winds and rains.
Trains have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to weather scientists, Trami tortures Japan until Monday.
The sky of the aces got even darker
The early season of the Aces has been bad.
The sky was almost darkened, when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) at its home field on Saturday.
The Porians now have five consecutive losses, and there are two points in total for six rounds.
No ace defender or two lower chain players have yet to score.
The pressure is also growing all the time.
Against the sport, the audience was out of control even when almost half of the game was left.
Six games have just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, we need to be worried because we played so weakly.
In particular, the performance of the second batch was shamefully bad, Jarno Kärki, who made the 1+2 performances.
Of course, sport enjoyed victory.
The team had a game under Friday, so I would have thought it would have been visible in action.
Maybe it did, but the Aces didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors to the bread day continued to increase
The bread day’s mother Pirkko Hyärinen marvels at the audience of the event in the big hall.
Somehow, I thought that maybe this year there wouldn't be so many people, Järinen will think about it in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017 and the Bread Day, the tractor candle's SM competitions were held, so perhaps it would be expected that the number of audiences could even fall slightly from the previous year.
However, it was different; the corridors were already tightly blocked before the tenth; the sellers reported that the products had run out; the news drill was sold more than before, with nearly 500 doses; and the number of cars Hährinen heard that there was an increase.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6,000, Hährinen will tell you later this afternoon.
Five hours in the morning and afternoon, especially for families with children, this must have attracted them to a record number of places.
In addition, Hyärinen estimates that the event will reach even further.
The sellers also bend to Lipper every year from a larger area.
This year, the producers of handicrafts, pastries and harvest products had arrived at the baker’s home by almost 100.
The bread day's mother Pirko Hyärinen was admiring the audience from the hall.
The harvest was blessed at the beginning of the bread day.
In the children’s series, Teija Kiviniemi’s beautiful bread won the public vote.
11 different forms of bread arrived at the children’s bread competition.
The winner of the rye bread competition Marjatta Vepsälainen spent the day at the marts pie shop.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - this is where you recognize a good lamp
Wake up the space, create the right atmosphere for the interior and read the book without getting tired of it.
It's worth a while to get a good light.
We gathered three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokinniemi, Sales and Marketing Director of Innolux.
Do your eyes a favor
The importance of lighting is increasing, the more years of age are behind it.
Sufficient light can help many with problems that come with age as the accuracy of vision decreases and more and more glare suffers.
Also, the need for light grows.
Sixty-six needs light three times more than twenty.
Therefore, it is worth noting the effect of light and the characteristics of the lamp for health reasons.
A good luminaire gives enough light, but not dazzling, Jokiniemi tip.
Create Beauty Around You
The beautiful interior can only be found with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of this moment can afford to choose.
The popular is a Japanese style that combines elephant and Scandinavianism and Japaneseism.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retrotyl with strong colours, different shades of metal or ice cream colours has also been inspired by the 70s.
The authenticity is just as fascinating as it is in other home decorations.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Show Your Personality
On the other hand, more is being invested in the home now than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a tailor-made, bold lighting that has a story to tell.
People clearly apply for Finnish and Nordic products, the origin and designer of which are known.
So let's be very design-conscious, Jokiniemi says.
The home does not necessarily have the latest trend light, but is a timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain timeless, jewelryy and elegant classics keep their surface from year to year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you, and goodbye!
KokoKoo showed the door to the Canadian scoundrel after three games
Kooko and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell's roads are breaking apart.
The Canadian batter played a total of three league matches in the orange black, KokoKoo reports in his release.
O'Donnell moved to KooKooh in August with a one-year agreement, including a trial period until the end of September.
Last season, a 26-year-old attacker played in KHL at Kunlund Red Star and at KHL farm in VHL at KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no record of O'Donnell's new company yet.
The player wants to set an example in recycling - things go to the world in recycling boxes, plastic switched to paper
In addition to the games, the game special shop Gamer is currently recycling packaging materials.
The products of the stone leg trading customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
The products ordered from the online shop are packaged, for example, in packages imported from importers.
All the packages coming to us are for re-use.
We may use the boxes dozens of times, as long as the package is in order to be able to use it, says Ville Purula of Oulu Game Man.
As a soft metal material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycling materials.
Dome plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are also going to move to recycling material in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others, too.
Surrounding is not, according to Purula, an extra effort.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be economic savings when, for example, re-use of cardboard packaging.
Recycling works naturally, as the main product range of the store, along with new products, includes, among other things, the games and equipment used.
Acquisition of each fashionable: The same shirt works in every outfit
Classical clothes work from season to season in a dress like that.
With their multifunctionality, they create the basis for a good wardrobe, as it is easy to gather different costumes around high-quality classics at an affordable cost.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knitted fabrics.
This category also includes a black pole.
Black knitted or crocheted fabrics made of natural materials, of a kind used for the packing of goods, of a kind used for the packing of goods, of a kind used for the packing of goods
The clothing can be combined with direct trousers, bored muscles, and jeans, and around it you can create both a controlled outfit and a smooth style.
The hemisphere is suitable for both a young modern dresser and a classic, sophisticated style designer.
This is how you create style.
The autumn trend look is made of gold browns and wide-angled blinds, black hemisphere and grey ankles.
The classic hemisphere together with other classics, the blue-green Scottish box and the wine-red Loifers form a female and sophisticated outfit.
Bring a uniform to the black hemisphere by combining it with loose, trendy pieces of clothing: jeans skirt, high boots, and tights.
Young and elegant!
The sabotage operation of Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to believe that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet Union, so-called DRG groups specialised in sabotage activity.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvalnaya group: sabotage and intelligence group.
The representatives of the Soviet Security Service in the Western KGB prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites," says Vasili Mitroh, the archivist who cut the KGB west (1922-2004).
His records were published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s.
The sites included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB acquired for DRG groups uniforms and accessories for covert operations for Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and certain persons.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riots, set up inspection stations for those leading from the peninsula to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from their mother country.
During the Cold War, agents hid for sabotage groups packaged with mines, explosives, lighters, and media.

True story on TV today: The climber was left to die twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on the man's own experience.
Tonight's movie is based on them.
Everest gets his premiere on Finnish TV.
In May 1996 a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers at Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur's 2015 guidance tells of the survival struggle, which has been treated with cereals.
Tragedy has been made into movies and documents... before.
Real events are also going through in this case.
The highest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced leaders of expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It's just that Hall was working as Weathers' guide.
The life of Weathers could be saved by an eye surgery performed before going to Nepal.
As a result of that and the pressure on the air, he lost sight, so the conquest of the top had to be missed.
Rob Hall kept going and never came back.
However, Weathers’ struggle for life and death had just begun.
As the storm rose, he got lost and never found his way back to camp.
When they came looking for a man, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn't believe in survival.
They left Weathers to die.
But it's like a miracle he still got on his feet and found the others.
Badly cold Weathers were still thought to be dying and once again he was left behind for his own happiness.
Clearly, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even the climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given help.
In the movie Beck Weathers, it's Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
A 200-year-old Eno church has been celebrated today.
Uncle's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today in church mountain.
The church was dedicated on October 4, 1818, and for the anniversary of the year the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The festival began at Eno’s church, at 10 a.m., at the family fair, after which there has been the offering of the herder’s feast table at Eno’s parish house.
The church was full.
517 persons attended the family fair.
Uncle’s church lord Armi Rautavuori was glad that so many people had come to church.
It is a great joy for a long time and gives strength to the work, says Mount Rauta (in the picture).
The fire of the Church of Insurance has touched many, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Church of Eno.
The Church of Eno is now the oldest church in Joensuu’s evangelical Lutheran parishes after the destruction of the Church of Infantry in a fire.
The wooden church was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a harlot was held in the heat of the fire, in which the church destroyed was silenced and remembered.
Pictures and videos: The medic flashed his power in Greece - The Sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane - type autumn storm raged from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medic, is called Zorba.
The Greek Department of Aeroscience has issued a red warning to the regions of Attica, Peloponnes, the Ionian Islands, Kyclads and Crete.
The images taken from the area show plenty of floods around Greece.
The video published on Twitter shows how the river, instead of the street, has suddenly appeared between the houses in the city of Kiato in the territory of Corinth due to floods.
The second video shows how the car has been carried by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnes peninsula, the heavy wind caused intense shipping.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens instructs people on their Facebook pages to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The delegation calls for the monitoring of weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medic, brings with it heavy rains and even flood danger.
According to CNN, according to a survey published in 2011, only once or twice a year occurs worldwide, typically around September-October, when the sea temperature is still high.
The storm that is now blowing left floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey to the north and towards Europe.
A concern in Greece has also been caused by refugee camps in the islands, such as in Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to decent protection.
The storm also leaves the areas destroyed by the terrains in the surroundings of Athens in the summer.
In Greece, too, the medic also grumbled last November.
We must not go to sea now, but the flights are still on schedule in the island of Greece, threatened by a autumn storm, are currently on holiday for thousands of Finns.
Trips to the sea are cancelled and while walking, it is advisable to be careful not to fly branches or other bulk goods on top of the storm.
Such instructions have been given by guides to a fair 3 500 people in Greece during the Finnish weekend on sun trips.
The instructions are needed, for even a storm of Zorbas, which has reached its horrors, has been predicted to beat up the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, the wind speed may rise in the bushes to up to 45 meters per second.
It's the heavy rains that increase weather's wretchedness.
All travelers from Finland to Greece through the Sun Trips and Tui, who have reported their telephone numbers, have been warned about the harsh winds by SMS, according to the tour operators.
But there's still sun and heat in the air.
According to Inka Ikosen, an expert in the communication of solar trips, the worst resorts have been avoided by the beginning of Saturday night.
For example, flights have landed and climbed according to normal schedule.
Of course, we keep track of the situation all the time.
Security ahead.
I supported media caller Antonia Schroderus tells me that their flights have also been scheduled.
We are constantly in contact with our staff at the target.
At least Crete had still calm, he told me about the early evening on Saturday.
At present, the most popular of the Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete, have a total of 1 500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos should reach Sunday morning.
On Saturday afternoon, even the sun had been mocked by the sun, and the temperature was set to 27 degrees, says the icon of the Sun Trips.
It is estimated that Zorbasen will become Turkey's next nuisance, though slightly relieved.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and we have, for example, checked the number of Finns flying to Antalya Tui, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvis and Janni Huss with perfectly identical evening suits at the Missifinal - this is how they react to the situation
The media person and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in open-back evening dress.
Hussi says he got a dress from Messlew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a really great suit for tonight, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress had also been chosen by the host, Shirley Karvinen.
The two also noticed similar costumes and reacted to the situation laughing.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanom he was in a hurry to get ready, and he had to get on the plane.
Hussi works as a backstage and red-carpet drinker at the Missi-final, and he's talking to the front row stars coming in.
Huss has a fresh move behind her because she moved from Kamp to Jäkäsaari on Friday.
I'm going to stay there for now. Let's see what happens.
The important thing is that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi thought.
Before he moved, Hussi was alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was only at the hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When the stress broke out, I got the flu, but otherwise the vacation was really successful, Hussi tells me.
Shirly Karvisen's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention to gather curious views from pensioners.
The host and Miss Suomi Shirly Karvinen reported on Miss Suomi's final in red carpet that she had enough to do with radio drinks and Love Island's Finnish illustrations.
The hurry has been sufficient even to the extent that Karvinen arrived at the finale directly from Finnair’s flight.
I made makeup and put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
At home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says he pulled his makeup out among the pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was fun, at least in the minds of the others.
She flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen tells us that he enjoyed his laundry in Love Island, Finland’s host.
He also describes his experience as stopping so far.
Karvinen says he went to see the singles of the program on Friday.
It's kind of rough.
They're people's real feelings, and Karvinen describes the feelings of the singles of the program.
How do I put on my over-the-counter boots?
Three perfect styles
Classical clothes are garments that work from season to season in a dress other than in a costume.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes even the most modern individuals.
A few years ago, the over-generation boots that turned into spring and winter were not gone anywhere.
Under their name, the boots above the knee are repeated in style from year to year and from season to season.
The visible boots share the views of the users, but a bold model should be tried, well... bravely.
Indeed, overgeneration boots are suitable for any outfit.
Whether it's tail, lace, tart or tricos, the simple skin or artificial skin surface of the boots works.
The long boots look good in both the festivities and the sheets.
Black upper-generation boots are also suitable for hemmed outfits.
They suitably balance the womanhood of a pink, flowery plying skirt and a thin, clumsy knitted stitch.
A fresh but autumn-style everyday costume for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-spirited outfit comes from a long copper-brown velvet dress, overgenerational boots, spectacular earrings and a staple bag.
Even though there is a certain degree of delicacy in the overgeneration boots, they are also perfectly suited for a relaxing everyday mouth with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy hat.
It's so easy and yet so elegant!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They operate for the rest of the year and take passengers on board, the City of Espoo informs.
Otaniemi’s robotic cars play a role as a bus simulator, as next spring in the region is expected to start traffic on a robotic bus.
The project develops and pilots a year-round robotic vehicle traffic and tests the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
The experiment will find out how robotic cars can handle the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robotic bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, traffic manager.
For the first time, robotic cars travel completely automatically between other transport modes without special transport arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of the passenger on board.
The vehicles constantly sense their environment with several sensors and assess whether the freeway is available.
If this is not the case, they will interpret whether a vehicle, bicycle or snowflake has been detected, for example, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4 responsible for the development of robotic traffic.
Robot cars run all autumn on three days a week: Tuesdays 13-15:30, Wednesdays 10-15 and Thursdays 10-15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
Robot-car stops can identify from the stop markings.
The bus is most likely to be boarded at the Ottakára station number 1.
The Mokoma band bassist fell off the stage in the middle of a gig and got hurt.
The Mokoma group informs us of the surprising situation on its Facebook pages at Tampere Pakkahuone's concert.
The Mokoma group’s gig in Tampere’s Packroom got a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band bass player Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage in the middle of the performance.
The situation happened when the band was pulling the last song of the night.
A spider's wrist broke.
The band informs about this on their Facebook pages.
"We're in the spirit!"
Last night, Santtu tripped off the stage in the last song and broke her wrist.
Let's hope for a quick recovery for the metal brother!
The rest of the tour will take care of the rest of the gigs with backup, and the pages will read.
Mokoman's fans respond with concern to a photo update where the bassist-Santtu lies with a cast in his hand on the bed.
This news has been expected, it was a pretty serious concern how bad it was.
The relief is great. Fortunately, the bones heal over time.
A quick and quick recovery for Santu and a good follow-up for the rest of the band plus a tourer!
And thanks for last night's great job, but do you promise to leave such a strong drama out of the end of the gigs in the future?
Police were watching the hunt in North Karelia and Savo.
The Finnish Police Department of Eastern Finland carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish hunting centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, the police forces reported on Saturday in social media.
The main focus of the surveillance was on the legality and authorisation of hunting.
Each hunter was inspected for a hunting card and for a hunting permit on the state’s land.
In addition, a check was carried out on the possession of hunting weapons and on the permitted quantities of self-loading weapons used in the canal.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was met during the surveillance, who was missing the required hunting permit.
The hunter was granted 12 daily fines for unauthorised fishing.
In addition, 133 drivers were blown by the police, and two of them are suspected of driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in the fine procedure, police order.
In conclusion, hunters are very well-mannered with the permission of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter stated that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years, and this was the first time someone checked the permits."
The Finnish police department in Eastern Finland will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
The mute goes to Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of Home Affairs Kai Mykkänen (see) travels to Turkey in the next few days to follow the selection of quota refugees to Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees to Finland this year from the Turkish refugee camps.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the Police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The United Nations Refugee Organisation (UNHCR) first selects people with a particularly vulnerable background.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered particularly vulnerable to refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are selected for the group to come to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some people are not arriving for different reasons.
It is also difficult to meet the non-governmental organisations operating at the borders of Turkey's Minister of the Interior, Süleyman Soylu and Syria.
Ilkka Salmi, head of the Office of the Ministry of the Interior, is also on the way.
I'm talking about raising a quota.
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1,050 per year for a couple of years, but no agreement has been reached in the government since then.
The assembly has supported the increase of the quota, but the project has last fallen against the blues.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) recently proposed a gradual increase of the quota to 1 500-2 000 people per year.
During this period of government, a silent visit is the first made by the Minister of the Interior to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Home Ministers Petteri Orpo (see) and Paula Risikko (see) were able to take up their new duties before the visits could be organised.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now, let's go to the hacks... no more knowing whether to cry or laugh.
Last Saturday, Karjan reported on a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article gave the impression that the draft law essentially prohibits all animals from being kept as farm animals, pets or otherwise in connection with business activities which are not specifically permitted by the regulations of the ministries.
So everything else is basically prohibited except the animals mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends up in law, it must mean that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits action that jeopardises the security of society or the good practice.
In principle, a ban is being introduced on all activities which are not expressly authorised by law or regulation.
This change causes nothing new to be tested in, for example, business activities, and nothing else to do before a law or regulation has been adopted.
The government has generally been weak in the preparation of legislation.
If we now go on the road that everything is prohibited in Finland as a matter of principle, which is not permitted separately, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt the Animal Protection Act would require an update.
But a law project in this direction is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it will accept such a ' everything is prohibited' procedure, which is not permitted by law or regulation.
I hope there's a reasonable minister here who's gonna stop this kind of legislative project.
Meti Forssell tip: 4 trendiest skirts in autumn

Turkey calls for mobile phones to be loaded in case of a storm
The Zorba storm in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, meteorologists warned, in particular, the seamen, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country, about the storm in Greece, by CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reported to be moving along the coast from south to north during the day.
On Saturday night, disaster and emergency authorities called on citizens to download their mobile phones before the storm and ensure the functionality of the Internet so that people can get timely updates of the situation,” says Anadolu Ajansi, a local news agency.
People have been told to stay home and away from windows and, for example, move garden furniture away from the wind.
Turkey is expected to have heavy rain and the wind is expected to blow in 28-33 meters per second.
In Greece, red weather warning
On Saturday, the Greek Aeronautics Service issued a red warning to the areas of Attica, Peloponnesus, Ionian islands, Kyklad and Crete in southern Greece.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and travel agencies for Greece warned the Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travelers were invited to follow weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
A little while ago, when I got in touch, there was a lot of wind and a lot of rain.
People were very calm, and Laura Aaltonen, Communication Manager from the Tui Travel Agency, told the STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By the end of the evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any messages from the Finns in distress.
In several ports in Greece, ships did not operate on Saturday, reported the local news agency Amna.
The boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, told about travel agencies to the STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and shipping were expected.
Finnair was told on Saturday that the weather was actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen crystallized the cause of Mercedes' superiority compared to Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen admitted that the worst competitor, Mercedes, was too hard a piece in the times of Russia's gp.
However, there is no reason to sink into the panic in the Ferrari camp, an experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but it's not a big deal.
Our car was best at times throughout the weekend for now, but they were just too fast, driving for the fourth, and Räikkönen, who was clearly left with Sebastian Vettelli about the speed of Mercedes, said.
Ferrari was already having a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
They asked him what the sudden fall of Mercedes was about.
They seem to be going faster than we do - so simple it is.
If I knew why, we'd probably go as fast as they did.
But I don't know more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
A rare treat was seen at times for the future stable of Räikkönen, Saber.
In the next season of Räikkösen, Charles Leclerc, a replacement for the Ferrari, was the seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final time drive.
For Swedish drivers, the tenth is best placed for more than three years.
And even though five drivers failed to drive completely in the second driving operation, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging to Räikkos in view of the coming?
Yes, if you compare them to where they were from the early days, then the step forward has been great.
There's a different story next year, so let's see.
It was there - Robert Helenius knocked Erkan Teper out: "Robbe is back"
The game between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper at Stuttgart's evening went on even.
The German was a more initiativeal party in the ring, but he did not get a good shot.
Clearly, Helenius controlled the match with his hard series, which found a good place.
The Finnish person was also in clearly better physical condition than Teper.
Finally, the solution came in the eighth round when Helenius struck Teper with his left straight.
The hit was so hard that the cracker in front of the home crowd didn't even try to get out of the carpet.
When the victory was confirmed, Helenius was moderately ventilated.
At the interview, he first praised the good atmosphere and opponents created by the audience.
Then he changed Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish fans.
We took the belt with us today.
Heleny was happy right after the fight.
It was a very big victory for Helen's career.
Perhaps it would be possible to get into the World Cup, Heleny commented on the evening magazine before the match.
Instead, the loss could have ended the whole boxing career.
Of course it's crossed my mind.
This is not getting any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper encounter.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster can multiply
According to The Guardian magazine, the vice president of the country is calling for a clear rise in the number of victims.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims may rise to thousands.
Severe circumstances
Rescuers are looking for the trapped as well as the dead in the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: I ask the port city and its neighbouring district, Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palus; the situation in Dongala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are badly injured.
There are still people in the congested buildings that the saviors have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
The saviors report that they have heard the screams of the people trapped in the ruins, but the lack of grubbing-up equipment has delayed the beginning of salvation.
The Indonesian President Widodo has ordered the army to rescue and deportation.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and communications in the disaster area are in many places broken down.
Fuel reserves are also running out.
The questionable response and long reflection of Miss Finland's finalist led to a sense of laughter
Billnas Ruuk is currently choosing a new Miss Finland.
During the interview, a question was asked to each of the Missifinalists.
The finalists asked me about the glass bowl on the stage.
In particular, the finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, a questionable answer caused the audience present to have sweet but well-intentioned laughters.
The question to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what was the latest book that was read by the misifinalist.
Anttikoski thought about his answer right before he began to hesitate.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is... Anttikoski said with a mind.
A pause in public thought of laughing until Anttikoski continued his answer:
The last book I've ever read is...
I've read books in school!
Something to do with economics, I'm sure.
So the last book I've read is the economics of someone, Anttikoski answered.
After his reply, Anttikoski received a lot of applause from the public, with laughter.
In the past, Anttikoski attracted attention on a tour because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 21:00, when Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm will give up last year's crown.
Sikke apple pear cake takes the tongue with it
This recipe is for you who have good, acidic apples from your own side, because the domestic apple is at shocking prices in the shop.
A pear may have to be bought, even though quite a few people may already have the pear tree growing.
This cake can only be made from apples if you do not want to buy pears.
Of course, the taste is more diverse if the cake is also filled with its pear.
Peel apples and pears and remove seed houses.
Slicing.
You can melt in the boiler.
Turn the eggs and sugar into foam and then add the corn flour and the molten butter to the foam.
Connect the corn starch, or corn, as well as the bread powder and add it to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Roast the bakery with bakery paper, spread 2 tablespoons of sugar to the bottom of the falcon and spread pear slices over the sugar.
Slept half the dough on the pear slices and the apple blocks on the dough.
Slept the rest of the dough on the apple blocks.
Bake in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Let's cool down in the vulture and then cancel out on the waiter.
Just cut the cake cold.
The cake is fragile in its structure and is easily crushed because of the fact that the dough contains almond and maize flour, which does not contain gluten.
Ruka will organise an international crime literature event in January
For the first time in January, Ruka Kuusamo will hold an international literature festival focusing on Nordic crime literature.
The Nordic Noir programme consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary programme numbers and jazz music.

In addition to Swedish names, guests from Iceland, Norway and Finland are also seen.
The Finnish writers are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the organisers of the festival, the northern location, nature, dark season and the unique environment of Kuusamo provide a framework for a unique written experience.
Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts of popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admirable?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two different types of "coolness": generally charming coolness and, in that regard, opposite dissident coolity.
According to researchers, charmingly cool people had many features that were considered socially desirable: they were outward, friendly, harmonious, and competent.
The dissidents, on the other hand, were characterised by distance, independence, rebellion, and line.
They thirsted for experiences and cared little about external estimates.
Both types were combined with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of hard-core is not longer than cool: a high status in adolescence does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what the US survey published in 2014 in Child Development reports.
Young people who dated early, partyed, applied for good - looking groups and sought favor with others had an increased risk of drug abuse and crime when they were young.
In their relationships, they did less well than they once did with their less noticed peers.
A lock that sends high status signals, badges or bells don't make a person cool, or at least a genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the majority of people were more prepared to become friends with their regular market shirts than with those wearing their shirts, despite the fact that most of them chose a badge when they were familiar with the situation.
If you're on the Greek holiday island, watch out!
There's a storm going on in there, a weather warning screaming at the red one.
During the weekend, in southern Greece, there can be as much water as in Finland over an average period of six months.
The Zorbas storm will strike Greece during the weekend.
Be prepared if you are in the area of Peloponnes, Ionian islands, Kykalate or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy of Athens reports it on its Facebook pages.
According to the embassy, the Greek Aeronautics Service has issued a red warning to the regions.
The approaching storm is also reported in Foreca’s blog.
According to it, the toughest hips of the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
Due to the comparison, the Kuisma storm hit Finland from the beginning of the week and blew its hardest at 31 meters per second.
According to the blog, however, the main concern of the Zorbas storm is not wind, but heavy rains.
At the end of the week, more than 300 millimeters of water may come in southern Greece.
It accounts for about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video about the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused floods in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize Love Island Finland -Anku, dead by men?
Appears with confusing YouTube videos
In the Love Island Finland series, the beautiful Anku by several men is also featured in strange YouTube videos published in 2010.
In the videos Anku advises ascarers, among other things, to make blueberry out of an old economic paper roll.
The anchor also shows how you can get into your tights with a silk with the right spikes.
Now we're gonna make Easter grass grow, but we're gonna do it a little surprisingly, Anku's hinting and introducing sawdust, pantyhose, and the seeds of the raccoon that he's turning into silo.
You can watch videos from below or from Anku YouTube.
Governor Bottas vibrates and bursts of adrenaline in Sochi. Is he going to be a helper of Hamilton on Sunday?
Governor Bottas was shaking a little more than ten minutes after his trip to Russia's gp stakeout while he was in front of the media.
The great tour left the first star of Mercedes, Lewis Hamilton, and it must have been an important mental criticism for the Finnish driver who collected this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the round.
Feels good, I'm still shaking a little bit, Bottas figured it out.
I've only been on a stake once this year in Austria (in the middle of the year), so it's been quite a while.
This track has been good for me before, and I've had good rounds again.
It is not easy to pass the Sochi track, so the departure is particularly important.
And, of course, Bottas was given the opportunity to answer the question of whether he's going to win tomorrow or whether or not he's going to be standing in front of the Jesus Christ of the MM-title.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I try to win.
There can be no other goal when you leave the stake, Bottas.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis' lead in Sebastian Vettelli is pretty big and the difference between me is very big, so keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas did.
Hamilton was really happy about Bottaksen’s success after the race, and Mercedes’ stable boss Toto Wolff also enjoyed what he saw.
Lewis had a plan to win the Valter, but he couldn't make it.
The governor knows he'll have to rip everything off to win Lewis.
And he was so loaded up that the adrenaline was bursting out of his ears, Wolff was glowing.
The question is whether the stable lets Bottaks and Hamilton drive honestly, Wolff answered in a way.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kiteleinen Erno Kinnunen won the Finnish Championship
The SM series of racing ended rarely.
Hardly ever before, the brothers have ended up being Finnish masters at the same time.
This was now done in the final rally in Turku and Salo’s surroundings by the Tusulites Eerik and Henrik St. Petersburgen, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 categories.
Erno Kinnunen, a Kiteist, secured the best result in his career, when the third place in the final race sealed him from the SM4 category of two-wheeled cars in the Finnish championship.
In Honda Civic, Kinnunen and the map reader Ville Mäkelä started the competition with a slow start, because the starting points were clear: the investment in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the dark of Friday night, the twin had to provide a leveling when some of the additional lights failed with another special test.
That's a pretty blind spot for the third one.
In a situation like that, you don't have to be silly.
On Saturday only the speed of Jussi Tepo in the second series was followed, Kinnunen said.
Syria demands the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister urges the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
He said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and that the war against terrorists is, according to him, "almost over".
In his UN speech Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their country of origin.
But there is no end to the seven years of war.
More than 360 000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Merkel told us on Friday in Germany that a meeting with the Presidents of France, Russia and Turkey is planned to take place in October.
Not quite Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court's judge drama on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, received an exceptional number of people on the squares.
In the United States, the full - power Supreme Court judge’s appointment drama attracted at least 20 million people to their televisions on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Californian professor Blasey Ford, accused of harassment, were in front of the Senate's Justice Committee to tell his story.
According to the preliminary findings, a total of 20,4 million viewers were followed by six main channels, i.e. ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition, several million more followed online consultations.
NBC reported that 6,8 million people followed the livetrums and CNN reported that they had made a record of 8.2 million livetables a year ago.
CNN's figure is going to rise to over 10 million when you count those who follow you through YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital was also able to launch 8.0 million.
Digital launches are channel-specific, TV audiences come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final readings on Monday, but they are, in any case, dizzy.
Less than 20 million
Over 20 million viewers in the United States usually only receive sports matches, as well as the great Oscar and Grammy gala of the entertainment world, as well as random political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
Of course, there's a trip to Super Bowl to the US's most viewed program, the finals of the American football league NFL.
This year, Super Bowl gathered some 103 million people at the NBC channel at the squares.
Last year, according to Nielsen, Trump’s first speech to Congress was attended by a total of nearly 48 million people and by a total of 30 million people who took office.
A Highly Important Thing
The Supreme Court's appointment is an extremely important case in the United States, since the posts are life-long.
Trump was already able to appoint a new judge when Anton's Scalia passed away from early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent then President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
The second place opened up when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by the President of the Republic, Ronald Reagan, but on a number of issues he was a so-called scale language whose voice could solve the position of the nine-person court.
He was a supporter of abortion law and the rights of sexual minorities and, for example, in 2015 he resolved in his voice that those of the same sex received the right of marriage throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative than his strains.
His choice to the Supreme Court may be to lock the court of conservative supremacy for decades.
Children have the right to know their parents
Parents of children under 10 years of age only see the health data of their children from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's weird.
The situation of the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health data or recipes of minors.
A temporary correction was made in autumn 2016 for persons under 10 years of age.
Since then, it has been promised to correct the practices, but it has taken an amazing amount of time to correct them.
Now the repair is promised - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a clash.
Then the understanding of the model is about pressing the button: now that the strap is held, let's open it.
Of course, a child can show his or her information to his or her parents if he has bank IDs or an official ID card.
But how many ten-year-olds have it?
The ID card is paid, and you can't even get bank cards from a 10-year-old.
Thus, the fourth grade information of the secondary school is virtually impossible to see except by asking for it printed.
It is not so much about parents' rights as about children's rights.
It is extremely important that parents can be involved in the care of the child.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be ensured.
Minors too may have family situations where not all things are freely discussed.
Often they relate to sexual health, of which free care is a deeply important human right.
In the United States, the FBI has begun to press charges against Kavanaugh.
According to the U.S. media, the FBI is investigating at least two women's harassment charges.
One of the women was before the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied the accusations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges at the request of the Senate's Legal Affairs Committee.
The report shall not take longer than one week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a criminal investigation into a more limited investigation, and it may not become public.
He threatened to kill cops at the police station in Kajaan.
Even at the chamber, the attached rapper continued to bullize.
The police say they put a man in a police prison "to calm down."
The police were threatened by a suspected assailant on a Saturday night in Kajaan.
The official will inform you of the incident that started when a fair 30-year-old man challenged the argument in the central restaurant.
The man first assaulted another client inside the nutrition store.
This resulted in the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by pouring him on the ground.
When the third party tried to interrupt, the man still hit him.
Triangular assault led to a police call.
Patrol picked him up and took Kajaan to the police station, the police will tell us.
The suspect was still aggressive at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
The police say they sent a man to a police prison to relax.
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition by an officer.
Donation organizations are preparing to start work on Indonesian Sulowes - "Clean water is the most urgent one"
UN Children’s Organization Unicef and other international aid organisations are ready to help Indonesia on Sulawes Island, says Kirsi Haru, Head of Information at Unicef Finland.
Local authorities are leading rescue operations, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef works in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal activity, Unicef always has full emergency response, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in ruins, both survivors and dead.
I would ask the city of Sulawes to have rescue measures in place, but the situation in the region of Dongala is somewhat less clear.
There are still places where connections do not work.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
Sulawes often has light structures, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors are found, they need protection at first, for example, tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in times of crisis.
For the first time in humans, it is often possible to offer water cleaning pills, which Unicef also has in storage.
Water systems are being repaired as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is first transported by trucks, for example.
In times of crisis, many children get rid of their parents.
The search for family members and the integration of families are part of Unicef's field of work.
Food aid is organised, among other things, by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN.
In the initial phase, the funds previously collected for emergency aid will be used.
Among other things, however, Unicef has already begun to raise money to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk, as Chairman of the Tesla Government, will end the $20 million fines for tweets.
The founder of companies that manufacture space rockets and electric cars, Elon Musk, avoids fraud charges under a contract with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will end his mission as Chairman of the Tesla government of the electric car company and agree to a fine of $20 million.
Musk will be excluded as part of the contract he entered into with the US Securities Regulatory Authority.
By agreeing with Musk to avoid fraud charges.
The U.S. Securities Commission, SEC, threatened Muski for security fraud because of the tweets he sent out in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw the electric car company Tesla from the stock market, which led to a rapid increase in the company’s share rate.
According to the agreement, Musk must not preside over the Tesla Government for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its government and take two "independent directors" into its management group.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor the communication of Musk.
Musk is still allowed to continue as CEO of Tesla.
In addition to the personal fines of $20 million in Musk, the company Tesla also has to pay the corresponding fines of 20 million to the financial controller.
The Twists led investors astray
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets led investors and Tesla's shareholders into a diversion.
Musk claimed that he would have secured financing to buy Tesla back on the stock exchange as a private limited company.
According to the billionaire tweets, the company would've been bought off the stock market for $420 apiece.
The share price in Tesla rose by more than 10 per cent per day after the tweets, but it decreased later.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims had no basis at all.
According to the overseer, he had not actually negotiated his alleged funding.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal of the stock exchange with the other management group or the company’s board of directors.
On Friday this week, the rate fell by 14 per cent when SEC announced fraud.
The new agreement is expected to re-establish the company's course.
The last sentence is not the reason
Of course, the clocks of the church do not ring when the wise ones do not move.
It's a technical problem.
The tower of the Helsinki Court has stopped.
The wise guys show up at 12 o'clock.
It's like an average horror movie: even though the church crypt was part of the exorcism, the organ would be on its own.
Of course this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for technical reasons: it has been broken.
It's been watched by a repairer, but some parts are broken and there's a new part waiting for it, Suntio Evelina Jamsen says.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact that the twitter account has already mentioned.
The account states that the last sentence is not a reason to stop the clock.
Jamsen tells me that church bells don't ring because of a flaw.
