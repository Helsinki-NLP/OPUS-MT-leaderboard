Four members of the Kemerovo Group were arrested in Estonia and Spain
According to the postman, the police in Spain arrested Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the underworld of Estonia, who is known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky.
Gulevitch, arrested in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects in Estonia.
It is suspected that it is members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal community aged 27 to 57, who mainly commit drug offences.
In the province of Malaga, in the province of Mijas, Spain, the alleged leader of the criminal community was detained.
Three men were arrested in Estonia as suspects, one of which, according to the data collected, is the leading figure of the criminal community, and two are members of the criminal community.
The data collected suggest that the criminal offence in the Community was clearly divided into tasks and roles.
The purpose of the criminal community's action was to commit drug offences and thereby earn proceeds," commented the head of the pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case, Public Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out the increase in the number of suspects in this criminal case," added the prosecutor.
These are people who have also been in law enforcement detention, and some of them have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of the cooperation," commented Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Department, said that detention was preceded by a preliminary investigation for nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work was realised and at the same time we held suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
He added that the officials of the Central Criminal Police were helpful in their detention in Spain.
For years we have had a good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the civilian guard.
These detentions are another message to criminals that we can catch them from the other side of Europe," said Leis.
The information collected so far clearly indicates that, while in prison, suspected men may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecution requested their arrest and accepted it by the court.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting his surrender to Estonia.
Real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation in the context of this criminal case.
The pre-trial proceedings in criminal matters are conducted by the Office for Organised Crimes of the Central Criminal Police and managed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court sentenced Slava Gulevich to extortion and punished him with a five-year imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered to be the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, emerged in the underworld of Estonia in the early 1990s when he began to blackmail in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and charged businessmen a monthly roof tax.
International joint operations, confiscations of proceeds and judgments in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the last nine convictions, the so-called Dikayev criminal community, the eight accused persons from whom the proceeds of crime were confiscated, or the nine convictions against the fact that Igor Aleynikov established in 2006 a criminal association aimed at the illicit trafficking of secret cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to trafficking in human beings in Eastern Estonia and South Estonia.
The amount of the seized criminal proceeds is approximately EUR 71 500.
The success of these criminal cases has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and, if necessary, work together in any of the countries of the European Union.
The Civil Rights Group warns of travelling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against state discrimination policies and racist attacks.
The statement of the group states: "The NAACP travel note issued for the State of Missouri, valid until 28 August 2017, invites all African-American passengers, visitors and Missouri to be particularly careful and extremely careful when moving around throughout the state, given the suspicious racial events of the entire race that have recently taken place over the state and have been presented here."
According to NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning by both the recent Missouri Act, which makes winning cases of discrimination more difficult, and the fact that the State's law enforcement officers are targetting minorities to an unequal extent.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are drawn to the roadside because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP Missouri branch, to The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had complaints so tightly before."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization for the US state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults towards black students at Missouri University and the death of a 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year in suspicious circumstances after he ran out of gas while driving through the state, and Missouri police arrested him without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the remark refers to a recent report by Missouri's Attorney General, which shows that black drivers are likely to be stopped in the state by 75% more likely than white drivers.
"The note is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be ready, whether it means taking bail money or informing relatives that they are passing through the state."
On the basis of the latest information from the FBI's hate crime reporting programme, 100 hate crime offences were documented in Missouri in 2015, which will place the state in a 16th place in the state for similar violations.
The travel warning is also the answer to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for a company to sue for discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after these states adopted immigration laws which required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because, according to ACLU, this increases racial profiling.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs usually issued travel warnings for other countries, but recently stakeholders have started using this measure as a counter-measure to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: What would anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, can be caused by five different viruses called hepatitis A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C, which may develop into cirrhosis of the liver and liver, is at low cost.
Health Department’s epidemiology advisor Kutsar says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of hepatitis - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grey stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The latter is also associated with a common name for inflammation of the liver called jaundice.
In children, hepatitis can occur without signs or symptoms of disease.
Various types of inflammation of the liver can only be determined from laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can be converted into chronic hepatitis and run for decades without signs of disease, which means that you may not know anything about your dangerous liver disease.
Kutsar of Kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in detail.
Hepatitis viruses spread from a sick person to an infected person and infect us by eating or drinking contaminated food, by sex, from the stools of the infected person to and from food, surfaces, objects, mouth, and drug use.
The risk groups for hepatitis infection include family members and carers of the affected, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with the infected, men having sex with men, drug addicts, passengers visiting countries with high spread of hepatitis A.
Inoculation can be prevented in vaccines, in particular vaccination is recommended for people who travel a lot and who are at risk for hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to comply with the daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruit and vegetables before you eat them.
hepatitis B viruses are transmitted by contact with the patient’s blood, drug injection, tattooing, Augusting, using blood-contaminated olympics (tooth brushes, shaves), donor blood, person suspected of having hepatitis, and from mother to foetus/next to newborn.
B The risk category of hepatitis infection includes injecting drug users, infected human sex partners, men having sex with men, newborns of infected mothers, family members and carers of the patient, healthcare professionals, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, and travelers visiting countries with high hepatitis B disease.
In particular, it is recommended that people at risk and those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes be vaccinated.
Other preventive measures to prevent hepatitis B include: prevention of the use, tattooing and Augusting of foreign hygiene and manicure tools, other sharps and needles and the use of condoms in the event of infectious sex or the prevention of sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan in Estonia and free of charge for children.
hepatitis C viruses are transmitted by contact with the patient’s blood, by injecting drugs, tattooing, Augusting, using blood contaminated shoulder cells, by donor blood, by having sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and by the hepatitis patient from the mother to the foetus/ newborn.
The risk category for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, infected human sex partners, men having sex with men, newborns of infected mothers, family members and carers of the patient, healthcare professionals, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, HIV infected persons and travelers from countries with high hepatitis C disease.
The preventive measure for hepatitis C is: prevention of the use, tattooing and Augusting of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharps and needles and the use of condoms in the case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
D Hepatitis viruses are transmitted by contact with blood and other body fluids, contaminated syringe needles, sexual contact and rarely infected mother to the foetus.
D The risk group for hepatitis is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and non-hepatitis B immunocompromised people.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
E hepatitis viruses are transmitted by fecal oral route with drinking water and food, including low-cooked meat, fish and marine shellfish, donor blood, co-administered syringes and infected mother to the foetus.
Passengers may be infected with hepatitis E in countries with high disease.
The preventive measures to prevent hepatitis E are: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and after eating, after taking care of the patient.
Fruit and vegetables should be washed before consumption, a low level of heat-treated meat, fish and seafood should be avoided, drinking only safe drinking water and avoiding drug use.
Although on the last round the competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic winners off the track, the 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final line and won 26.49.51 in time.
Farah did not think long after the finish, drawing his husband Tania and children along with him.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told the journalists.
Farah is targeting the fifth title race in London for 5,000 and 10,000 metres of gold duel.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Dam in Gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait extraordinary story" is much deeper than the story of the art of the late 19th and early 20th century Vienna's cultural life.
But even more profoundly into history.
A fear - inspiring set of information could have been used, or harder in a fly axe, a narrower theme would have allowed the extraordinary story of the portrait allowed in the title to be more influenced.
There are currently two books between one cover: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, pictured by Gustav Klimt and his painting "Daam in Gold", and a much more extensive and comprehensive history of respected Jewish families and German occupation with its consequences in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the cultural life of Vienna in the middle of the pulsating world, and who has become Austrian capital, can hardly imagine how more than a hundred years ago life was around Ringstrasse, or how everyone turned their heads at the Central Café when Klimt walked in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe’s richest cities, and you feel more like a gram more culturally.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a city where incurs unreparable syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, as if nothing was added to development.
Or perhaps, however, any pair-worded brush tie adds colors to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews had exploded in Vienna, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost every ten people in Vienna were Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married to Ferdinand Bloch, the Czech sugar magnate, twice, and Klimt was posed for his famous paintings, his father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele's whole glamorous life that she belonged to didn't drag.
When you look at "Dam's Gold," it's hard to believe that the great lady of socialism was infected towards the end of her life and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his wife from Klimt, he was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt’s order was then paid 4 000 kroons, a quarter of the price of a well-placed farm.
The fact that some portraits were suspected of having a master's love story model did not discourage the sugar magnate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only certain fact is that the model developed during the work and the close relationship of the artist continued for the rest of their lives.
Anne-Marie O'Connor, "Daam darling.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait extraordinary story", Varrak 2016, translated by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before the start of the work with Adele, Klimt had been to Ravennas San Vitale in the Basilica, and researchers think that the brilliant mosaics seen there from Empress Theodora gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaig.
Klimt presented his "Dam gold" in Vienna in 1908 and at about the same time (from 1907 to 1908) another golden painting "Sudulus" was born.
Art historians did not miss the similarity of two women.
What about Hitler?
"I think I owe him money to make his handiwork available to the public in memory of my friend Klimt," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Museum of Belvedere and wished their family to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had a second portrait of Adele.
In his will (Adele left in February 1925), he also asked his husband to leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscape paintings at the Austrian Gallery.
His jewels were passed to Mary and Luis, his nieces.
A year after Klimt had graduated from "Austria Mona Lisa", he had tried to get to the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, a 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but failed at the drawing exam.
Although Hitler’s later anti-Semitism is sometimes considered to be the cause of the Jewish professors’ failure to accept him to the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the assignment of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in the Maria Testament, had become noticeable by 1939: the rich collections of Jewish art in Vienna had become important for the Nazi Party.
Hitler's personal art assets also fit some of Adele's work at home, but not Klimt's.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year trial began between the Austrian government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauer.
It should be noted here that if the "Swallow" is seen in Belvedere Castle in Vienna, then Adele Bloch-Bauer's "Dam's Gold" must be seen to the New York Neue Galerie.
And before driving to Vienna, read the above book.
Even if you went to see Klimt's work, it wasn't going to be a plan, because at least after closing the book, my emotions turned around more of a Nazi and Jewish theme than a $135 million painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
Thus, not so much a portrait as a story of the fate of the family — and a very touching story.
The Bauer family tree that was introduced at the beginning of the book greatly facilitated the orientation of events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In the premise, Gold was 2.16.62 swimming very close to its own personal record of 200 m of back swimming.
The topmark dates back to the 17-year-old maid from a week ago, when the Canadian Junior Championships won 2.16.58, Priit relays the Ghost Swimming Blog.
Gold was the last to get to the A-final in the tenth grade.
At the final, he passed the distance in 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful top mark.
Alina Kendzior's record (2.15.13) left Gold a bit more than half a second apart.
Gold was the third in the ranking of all times in Estonia, and its fresh personal top mark is the fifth result of all times in Estonia.
A young hope for the future is still at 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in free-wind and 200 m and 400 m in complex swimming in the Canadian adult championships.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships took place in Toronto and Gold took successful initiatives there too.
He won 200 meters of free space with a silver medal time of 2.03,22.
This distance was last flooded by the Estonian woman in 2008.
Elina Partõka, the only record woman in Estonia, has been swimming this distance in Estonia faster than Gold.
The Estonian woman living in Canada won a bronze medal at 100 m in her free space with an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season's top mark of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older, has been swimming this distance only a century faster.
Upon receiving a letter of 1.03.69 of the time in the opening session, he arrived at the personal top mark at 100 m in the back swimming.
On a half-long distance, he only achieved the seventh position while swimming in the finals 2.17.31.
Gold is currently running the Estonian season ranking on four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen teeth
The time for vacations is now, which also means relaxation for President Donald Trump of the United States.
However, since Trump has so far been one of the presidents who took the most days off, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to the U.S. Today and CNN, the President's plan is to spend 17 days in a golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the President's leave began yesterday, the opponents of Trump have already spoken about the issue of leave for a week.
They're giving Trump too much rest.
It is the President’s custom to spend weekends in his villa in Florida, Virginia, and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 term of office.
For example, George W. Bush had already been on leave for 67 days, while Barack Obama had half as much as Trump, only 21 days.
But Trump tends to forget things quickly.
The days after he became president, Trump said on the show "60 minutes" that there will be no time for long holidays during his adopter, because there is a great deal to be done.
He also expressed a grudge three years ago on Barack Obama's holiday.
The current president then wrote on Twitter: "As Obama is on holiday, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS journalists are cutting off their heads".
According to White House officials, a 17-day golf club visit is not exactly a relaxation.
It is officially called a work leave, during which Trump does not have time to read or to engage in other recreational activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for taking a job.
In the West Wing of the White House, the system of air conditioning will be replaced, which is why all personnel had to leave.
The Western wing also includes Ovalkabinet and other Presidential premises.
"I don't think any of you would want to be on the west wing in August, if it's 38 degrees and no air conditioner," said Lindsay Walters, the White House speaker, who stressed that the president would continue working on his leave.
From where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you'll get a clue on the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook do not apply to the state office unless you tolerate the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew a lot about bad media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to cut him short for everything from domestic politics to political principles.
She was upset by the criticism, of course.
But he didn't make his critics shut up.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "free speech may be taken away from us and, in a dark and quiet manner, we may be led to slaughters like sheep."
This will bring me to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who will have to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan subjects have blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who made their views public on his official Facebook page.
And towards the beginning of the week he was sued by the American Civil Liberty Union (ACLU).
The governor's office stamped the action void, and the web comments were full of counter-reactions in the style "Who cares?".
"It's just Facebook," said many.
But it does matter.
And that matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is an amazingly popular Republican governor in a predominantly democratic state.
His acceptance percentage is at the top of the 50 governors of the state.
Hogan isn't an unthinking responsive butthead.
He has led the state with a firm hand and remained firm on his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool for communicating with his constituents, for example, by showing his bald head after chemotherapy for the first time.
Thus, the governor's paper, which is a public forum with an official label, is managed by the blocking of visitors to taxpayers' dollars, and ultimately dangerous.
Amelia Chase Chase, Hogan's spokesperson, defended the governor's behavior in the interview with The Washington Post, claiming that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of online trolls, spam mailers, or people full of hatred.
The Post spoke to a number of real people Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they are, real people who communicate with their elected leaders. Teacher, corporate owner and pastor, not Internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not dirty.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post under pressure from Hogan Catholicism.
A lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, Lakshmi, Sarma Raman, did not encourage anger, but he did hate crimes.
"I said politely that I was disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in The Post's Commentary.
"I also do not like the idea that the number of people who comment on the same subject is calling it an immediate, arbitrary collective effort, rather than admit that it is a great deal of concern for citizens."
What the governor's office called a "directed spam attack" would probably be called a "public support".
The Facebook age allows messages to be easily matched by simply blocking the criticism or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the old days when workers had to be sent out to collect and burn and keep quiet the newspapers with critical guides.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for taking away Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who are blocked from his Twitter stream.
One of the first judgments with a significant meaning was made on this subject last week in Virginia.
In Alexandria, U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris decided that the chairman of the Loudoun County Supervisory Board violated the first amendment to the Constitution when he blocked the voters from his Facebook page.
Kentuckys also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for the use of ACLU Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar effect to the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous writers cut off his direction.
And even then, Washington had to put an anonymous troll in the chest.
People wrote letters to newspapers from pseudonyms like Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, making Washington’s decisions to the ground.
According to the historical documents collected in the framework of the web-based George Washington Letter Collection project, his office was buried in petitions which criticised his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't make them keep quiet.
Freedom of expression, differences of opinion and discussions are the cornerstones of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European first number Ronan Rafferty hopes for comfort in the home territory within the next three days when 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place at the golf courses of the East Lothian Renaissance Club.
The Northern Irishman, who was in charge of the last round of the Archerfield Links tracks in the neighborhood last year before Paul Eales descended, is attached to the new venue and performs the role of a tournament ambassador instead of Jerry Sarvad, the founder and CEO of the club.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built, and now we see how the club will shine with this event in full glory," said Rafferty.
"Players see the track in its best form, it's in a brilliant state.
Jerry has done an excellent job building this place.
He's an enthusiastic supporter of the golf game, and he's proud of what he's done here.
This will allow the track to be presented in an excellent way."
An Englishman, Everes, looks forward to defending the championship for the first time, even though he has won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a very special feeling," said a player in Southport.
"I couldn't protect my Extremedura Open title because it was taken off my winning race calendar a year later.
It's magic to come back to this place.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember last year's memories. For me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always bear in our hearts."
Gary Orr, who joined the European tour of seniors at the beginning of this year when he received 50, will return to the competition again.
It is his first event in Scotland following his participation in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"The home to play is always a little more meaningful," said Helensburgh's man, Orr.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel extra tension.
I've enjoyed playing again and I've shown you a pretty decent golf game.
I'm happy with the way things have been going so far."
Ian Woosnam, former winner of the Masters tournament and Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty will join the Trio.
Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scottishs in the race fire, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge, and parking a car costs GBP 5 for a car with one passenger and GBP 10 for a car with two or more passengers.

Poverty and Death Indonesia’s Golden Land
If Bardina Degei prepares dinner, she won't use the stove.
He doesn't even use a pot.
In a wooden cabin in Enarota, the Panaua region of Indonesia’s impertinent province, the housewife places a sweet sweet sweet sweet in the local language of the house directly at the fire station.
In half an hour, the charred tuber is taken from the fire and the unwashed hands are vehemently applied to the skin.
Degei sits on the mud floor with no furniture, and there she does her daily chores, such as washing laundry with cloudy water from nearby sex.
The role of the toilet is played by a spider in a room without roof.
Since she is the youngest of four wives in her husband’s life, she has not been assigned to care for any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
However, working late may be dangerous for most of the men in the village, and many of them drink hard, and there are soldiers.
"No one dares walk around after 5:00 a.m.," he says.
This is a rare look at life in the mountainous region of Papua. It is the former Dutch colony, which was added to Indonesia in 1969 after the polemics, in which only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote in the eyes of the occupation forces.
The move of the Dutch to free themselves from the power of the Dutch towards their rage quickly against the Jakarta government, which continues to keep the region under its strong control, avoiding foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papuane and Western Papuane, leaving the eastern part of the island to the independent Papuanea.
Enarotal is also a remote and deserted place. To get here, you must fly 90 minutes from the province capital Jayapura to Nabire and then pass a five-hour journey that makes you nauseous by car.
There's no public transport.
A city of about 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered with waved iron roofs, the rusts of which have turned the various shades of yellow brown.
Very few Indonesians have made their way here, not to mention journalists, and there have been almost no foreigners.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, Pope Mee Pago worshiped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing such clothes," says Degei, referring to his colour-thirty hand-woven turban, dark blouse and bright skirt.
"Before that, we wore only leaves of plants on the body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are one of the worst in Asia.
But it's also a gold-rich land in Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province of about 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey, the world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined around USD 3.1 billion of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be proud of consumable timber, estimated at USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of the suffering of the popes, as they result in the suffocating presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study of The New York Times showed that between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid around USD 20 million to local military and military units, including up to USD 150 000 to one officer.
The Pope’s efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden han, and they go around mercilessly.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 popes have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Committee on Human Rights, the mass killing in the mountainous countries of the Papuane tribes in the 1970s was the measure of genocide.
Last year alone, over 3,900 peaceful protesters arrested in the Indonesian police area.
The 2016 Birsbane archbishop's report "We All Lose" contains evidence of the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (one report says that rape and electric shocks are particularly common) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"The number of victims is difficult to count because such incidents take place every week," says Andreas Harsono, researcher of Human Rights Watch Indonesia.
The screws are even stronger because the natural resources of Papua have caused the influx of newcomers from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demography is changing because Muslim economic migrants from the countries of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes are coming from the Indonesian people.
The Jaava family food stores sell crispy chicken and mixed vegetables gado-gado served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"The migrants started selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local paparazzi," explains Abeth You, born in Pania, who moved to Jayapura, the province capital for work.
"Bapsauces of oil are therefore losing their market share in the papaya Mama-Mama."
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, who is known among the people as Jokowi, promised to deal with these inequalities and violations of human rights in Papua in his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter won his way to Jakarta Presidential Palace from the 29 constituencys of Papua 27 including Pania.
But in Papua, very little has changed, and the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted in favour of Jokowi in the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," says You.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi took office in October, Pania was in a low position.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotali sang Christmas songs by the fire when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on the motorcycle from the darkness.
The kids who hit them told them to turn on the headlights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses said that drunk soldiers chased children and beat them with their gun handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot the kids.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yimo, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby electoral committee building was set on fire, and the next day things increased further.
Some 1,000 young men, women, and children from Papua gathered for justice in the football field in front of the local police station and military command center.
They wore ceremonial yachts and performed the waita dance of the Papua mee pago tribe, during which they ran around and imitated the bird song.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police and the military.
"If the crowd is more than three times resistant, shoot them," said Time magazine according to an official document, but which has not been issued to local media publications.
The oldest in Yeremias Kayame (56) in Kego Koto, the city of Enarotal, felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he said to the magazine TIME in his bright colors on the tree house porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says that the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, a lot of shots," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw got hit three times by a cousin who saw him shoot.
"I ran to him and searched his body to make sure it was him," said TIME from the dark of Yohanes, who uses only one name like many Indonesians.
"I saw him dead... kissing him."
Chief Inspector Yotje Mende of the Papua Police told the reporters that he was only responsible for the security of his station because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when we are threatened to be killed," said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistayo, the press representative of the Papua police in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many were injured.
The news of the killings came to Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi made a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed compassion to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses in Papua.
"I want to solve this case right away, so it will never happen again in the future," he said.
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an extra-judicial mechanism for the resolution of crimes against human rights.
But there were excuses almost immediately.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes," he said.
However, when speaking to Time magazine on June 5, Jakartas, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying that he had no intention of establishing a mechanism to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All will be resolved by law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of the death of more than 1000 people in the framework of the 1999 bloody independence referendum in East Timor for crimes against human rights, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Papua, including those in Pania.
The families of the victims of Pania accepted such claims with dark dissent.
"I've been questioned four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed that the people of Pania were afraid to dispel this incident.
He said he was beaten by the army after he helped bury four victims.
"After burying the bodies, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot village residents in the Pania neighbourhood in Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, when they had a struggle between the village residents and the construction company manager who refused to transport a unconscious man to a hospital.
This male, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, drowned in the nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the police, and the others responded with warning shots.
But according to the locals, the mobile Brigade (the Indonesian military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in a panic, we are afraid of revenge," said Time 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the entry of the injured.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the police to be held accountable and for the police to withdraw the mobile Brigade from the region.
Pania has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the tribes of honey, many, Dani and Damal living in the glare of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papuan Movement (VPL), an army of rebels that, according to him, defends the rights of the popes by random attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL leaders come from Pania, including Tadius Yog and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the military has, on the pretext of protecting the sovereignty of the state, arrested in Pania over the past few years and deliberately detained thousands of people.
Some of them never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Pania is known as "the tragic forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarota is too expensive to buy for the locals.
The bread is just as unavailable.
People grow all their food themselves mainly sweet potatoes, plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farm sacrifice is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvests to the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between the indigenous paparazzi and the new migrants, who have arrived a great deal since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport, has increased.
These few jobs that exist go to better educated and more prosperous migrants.
The popes themselves often lack capital or the skills needed to conduct a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying here because there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai tribe council.
Independence keeps the world's eyes away from the Pope.
In addition, there are strict restrictions on foreign media.
Towards the beginning of this year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua because "they did not follow the relevant practices", although they had been given a rare authorisation to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of the Asian Department of Human Rights Watch, the electoral promises of Jokow have not been implemented to remove restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development.
"In Indonesia, journalists trying to report on the most troubled provinces of Papua and Western Papua are threatened by the rejection of a visa and the blacklisting of new threats," he said in his statement.
The lack of a look at the press cage means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries were encouraged by Tonga, Nauru, Belarus, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands to investigate "a wide range of crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Pania.
The same countries have also historically supported the VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a press representative of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, dismissed the group's accusations, saying to the journalists Jakarta: "In Indonesia, democratic order and freedom of the press are still in place, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of anti-human rights cases."
Local people want more attention to be paid to foreign governments.
When the Dutch official delegation headed by the country's Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Bari visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people interrupted their presence at the meeting, but the source who wished to remain anonymous said that their silence was silent, asking: "We want freedom."
New presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019, but the popes do not believe that they will vote again in favour of Jokow.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Pania," says Hobai, Chairman of the tribe council.
He wants Jokowi to understand that, in addition to the constant threat posed by the Paniian people, they suffer from poor education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Pania, like the other popes, consider their voice to be a debt to Jokow.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of Pania’s shooting victims were still able to cope with the last symbolic rebellion, burying one of the victims in a country opposite the police station and military base.
Knowing that justice may never be set on foot, at least those responsible will not let them forget their crimes.
"One of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Fire swallowed up the Dubai Torr skyscraper for the second time
On Friday, the fire crashed through one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of people to escape from this 337-metre building and 79-storey building.
It's the second fire that's been destroying a tall building for only two years, which happens to be called the Torch, or the Tower of the Tar.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up on the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down the 50th floor," said Reuters, a resident who called himself George.
According to Dubai Civil Protection Officers, firefighters extinguished the flame about 4 a.m. in the morning at local time 00:00 GMT and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the external surface of high-voltage materials around the world.
In the course of the investigation carried out after the 2015 fire in the Torch Board, it was found that the most damage was suffered by decorative panels and insulation on the outside surface of the façade.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the Grenfall Tower and the façade panels in London could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
See: these phones will probably become sales hit in the fall
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because then telephone manufacturers will release their new top models.
In the spring Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came for sale, new hit-phones are also expected for the store in autumn.
According to TV2’s marketing and sales director Kristjan Seema, these years are characterised by innovative design of the flagship, an eye-to-eye scanner, a 4K resolution screen and an ultra-fast processor.
In the technology world Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the front of the sales list for Estonian smartphones, was a big thrill.
In the autumn, smart fans will be allowed even faster charging, a more durable battery, a more high-quality camera and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that according to the rumors, it is already possible to make assumptions and predict four top models that are likely to conquer the sales charts this year.
These four high-end smart phones will reach the poets in the fall of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the shops already in mid-September.
Word is, what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it is spreading a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences next to iPhone 6s, it is expected that the new model will be fully distinguished from the previous one on Apple's tenth birthday.
Four colors have been mentioned: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is lost, and the fingerprint is built inside the screen.
JonyIve, Apple's designer, demands that a new iPhone model looks like a smooth glass.
The ceramic version of iPhone has also been discussed.
In addition to the eye-wipe scanner, wireless charging and even more high-quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
I'm sure it's one of the smart phones we've been waiting for.
The pre-ordering of the brand new Galaxy Note 8 model will start on 23 August.
There have been a lot of rumors about what new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It has been reported that even more is intended for the business user and that S Pen allows even more functionality.
There should be two cameras on the phone, one of which is a wide angle and the other a narrower field of view.
Now, no one knows what two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test, which is certainly comparable to iPhone 8.
But we look forward to August 23rd.
Although Nokia has been selling three smart phones at the top of Nokia 6 this year, their flagship - Nokia 8 – is still missing, which will be presented on 16 August.
We expect a screen from Nokia 5.3 inches to the edge and an ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminium envelope and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras produced by Zeiss.
If Sony's specific flagship has so far been XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future, with even more innovative features.
We're waiting for a smartphone that's a little bit more modest than XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
Sony's new model has been speculated to have a screen of at least six inches.
What the reality is, we can see soon enough, because traditionally, Sony has released his autumn flagship at the international technology fair IFA, which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year.
According to leaked telephone calls, Trump forced Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post published the telephone transcripts between Donald Trump, President of the United States of America, and the Mexican and Australian Heads of State.
On January 27, Trump made a phone call to the Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, to stop the public declaration that he is not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States broke the wall with him for his public condemnation, saying, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump set up his presidential campaign on the promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore to make Mexico pay for this project.
Transcripts of his first speech to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, exposing an intense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States of America would take on refugees heading for Australia was "magic", "nosy" and "wrong". He claimed that the agreement that was made during the Obama government would make him look like "a leader" because he had proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees into the United States.
Trump ended the call by informing Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not bring an appeal against OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in the case where the City of Tartu rejected their offer for the purchase of bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a decree rejecting the offer of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in Tartu’s bus procurement, as the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Abihtin, Head of the City Law Service of Tartu.
This is a public bus service in Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The MRP City Lines appealed to the Supreme Court about the decision of the Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court did not take this action.
Although many in social media complain that the noise from the Weekend festival is disturbing their nights and the entire city is full of drunk parties, there are many who have no bad words to say about the festival that lasts on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the store was so polite!
I didn't see any fuzzyness or rudeness.
I even saw kindness," says the monkey Laine.
"It's good that they come, be, and enjoy Pärnu, which is winter like winter sleep," he adds with joy.
I don't care about a rainy wave of sleep coming out of the beach.
When he was living in the city center, he still heard music being played on the beach, now the music has not reached his homecoming.
"But I hope I can hear him," he says with joy.
Agnes, who has also spoken to the evening paper, says that the big festival is more good for Pärnu - it is a good thing for local traders.
In addition, he rejoices that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.
Even though I'm no longer on the beach, I'm glad the beach is alive.
And I'm glad the people are moving and it's been like this three times," she says.
It must have been a little worse the first time.
"Then perhaps there were complaints," he meditates.
Yet, he said that the noise on the beach is common for the summer chiefs.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town," says Harri, who is in the park.
No. No. No. No.
What for?
We should all stick together.
To think about how this interethnic communication would be better.
A loud music man doesn't get crushed.
It doesn't bother me, though I live right there.
"Good people can stick together and there's no trouble," he says.
According to him, visitors to Pärnu are polite.
"With the bottles, of course, they have exaggerated a little, but the young are young and the Lord God - let go, but be people and we can do it!" he says.
Coastal residents have traveled somewhere by then, either to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this noise," says Tiina, who walked with children.
His family’s dream music does not bother you either, although last year it went even further than this year.
Last summer was the other way around the stage, we heard more.
We live outside of the city ourselves, that it actually sounds pretty good on the river of Pärnu," he says.
Pearson cuts another 3000 jobs and reduces dividends to revitalize business
On Friday, the British educational company Pearson said that there would be a reduction of 3 000 jobs and a reduction of 72% in its intermediate income, thereby launching another restructuring programme to address the threat of business.
According to John Fallon, the jobs to be lost, which are likely to be brought together at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will be added to the 4000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another GBP 300 million ($ 394 million) under the third cost reduction programme in order to try to reinvigorate the business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House last month to its partner company Bertelsmann, said that their expectations regarding the year have not changed since the 1 % increase in sales revenue was announced to GBP 2,05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convoying in Kabul: A suicide attack killed a NATO soldier
According to officials, the suicide bomber attacked military convos in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and hurting several others.
The NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in Herat's mosque attack.
On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO statement said that a Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "man-made explosive".
According to the statement, everything is damaged in a stable state and is being treated at the US Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondents, the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) are a serious source of concern for the forces in Qarabagh, NATO Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, some 20% of them in the capital city.
At the end of July, at least 30 people were killed by a car bomb in Kabul.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people were killed by a large bomb attack in the city centre - this has led to the most deaths in the country since the US-led forces rejected the Taliban in 2001.
This violence underlines the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while the President of the United States, Donald Trump, is considering whether to increase the number of US troops and police forces.
According to the correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public trust crisis against the government, its policies, and especially President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA annulled the decision to postpone the Regulation
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annulled the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama-time regulation, which obliges States to limit the emission of fog-related gases, one day after 15 States brought the Agency before the Court of Justice on account of this move.
EPA announced its decision to continue with the '2015 Ozone concentration measurement operations' on Wednesday, saying that it showed the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe that we need to have a dialogue and listen to them with partners from our states," said EPA Director Scott Pruitt in his statement.
Pruitt had announced in June that EPA was intending to postpone the determination of ozone levels, which would measure sudu pollution in different parts of the country, in order to determine where it should be further reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to comply with a more stringent air quality standard.
The 15 mainly democratic states, together with the Columbian community, brought an action on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to withdraw a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama.
But these efforts have led to counter-reactions among Democrats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website says that inhaling ozone-containing air "may reduce lung function and increase the risk of respiratory disease" such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
German pigs and cattle can have a party, as strong rains threaten the harvest of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, according to Bloomberg.
This year, it may be that the rain attacks that have lasted weeks before harvest may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry is only suitable for animal feed.
"The quality of the wheat is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Agravis Raiffeisen analyst Bernhard Chilla.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat for animal feed, which is double the usual, was predicted by Agravis.
German farmers, like their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First, winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by a hot wave in June.
In July Germany was hit by rain attacks, which has continued in August.
Many have turned their eyes to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five percent of the wheat has been harvested.
In most regions the harvest has not even begun, the local harvester in Ceravis reported.
"It's a pretty complicated day," said Frank Deckert, Cheravis' senior dealer from Rendsburg.
Consistency in everything, or Finnish interior design, the clever swings
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the messi homes, as large windows reach the magnificent views of Saimaa shores in many (life) rooms.
At every step, our northern neighbours’ efforts to create both rough and perfect (energy-efficient) homes will begin.
The Finnish people’s use of wood as construction and finishing materials, furniture and beauty products deserve to be admired and respected.
Exciting techniques and smart solutions can be found in fair houses by both the builder and the (home) designer.
There it is evident that black, white, and grey shades, if supplemented by wooden tones and maids, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week because the fair will last until August 13.
Appetizers and pots suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
At night, the line was drawn down to the Weekend Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix made every effort to remember the latter as a performer.
The crowd had really turned around during the Garrix performance - singing, flute, dancing with a dream.
When Garrix finished, a common mass was spread from Pärnu Beach to the city.
We'll bring you a gallery with all the pictures our photographer took on the Weekly in three days.
I'm sure you're one of them, too, find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible confrontations.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be at the collision rate to face up to 66,7 kg of weight, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN's office in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeatable World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, walked across the hall to welcome the Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's featherweight Champion.
After the victory of Garcia's unanimous decision over the former four-time world champion Adrian Broner on Saturday at the Showtime, both fighters will be the first in the ranking.
Garcia handed his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you luck."
Lomachenko protects his belt against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 7 p.m. in ESPN.
When a couple posed for the photographs, the manager of Lomachenko in Egis Klimas stated that the possible conflict between the fighters would be "perfect measurement".
"I'm a former featherweight," said Garcia.
"I moved up for the Broner [63.5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm 63.5 kg small.
I want to move down the lightweight.
And he has to move up the light weight [61,2 kg] and then we can fight.
That's what fans have wanted.
Let us offer them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The world of hell needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid to watch it. It is part of his strategy to have Lomachenko debuted towards the end of this year in the 61.2 kg class in order to make it possible for next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 nokuut), who also has an interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's match after their lightweight title round Forum on 23 September.
"Looking at this fight could be paid because the fans have wanted this opposition," Garcia said later, saying that it is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We're the main performers.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia says she thinks Lomachenko is a great fighter and she can go see his Saturday fight.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praise of Garcia, saying that he thought the three division masters from Riverside looked like "very slow; I'm sorry, Mikey... you wanted it to go off."
Garcia said the goal was to show the force of impact and then fight.
Both confirmed that they felt an increase in tension for the prosperity test between them.
"It's a struggle that awaits realization.
No other contrast produces so much attention and buzz.
I'm more than willing to work for it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey's just the one.
It'll be a good fight."
Which corners of the world are they moving to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Agency (PPA) issued a record of more than 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia for work, study or family.
For example, if last year it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6702 foreigners, this number was 4928.
Authorities cannot tell how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be carried out at the Ministry of the Interior.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ten years ago, in recent years this figure will be close to 2000.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased dramatically during the Ukraine crisis - in 2014, 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, a year earlier 675.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is increasing most in Estonia – last year 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than they left.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and due to difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought in a country where the community and many of the family are already ahead," said Kristin Rammus, Press Representative of the Ministry of the Interior.
The number of Ukrainians who received a temporary residence permit last year and in the soil was higher than the number of Russian citizens, although the total number of temporary residence permits issued for the last ten years has been highest.
If the Ukrainians come here to work mostly, then Russian citizens for family migration.
"In view of this historical Russian community, they are most likely to have the biggest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, migration researcher at the Academy of Internal Defence.
"If you look at where Russian citizens have moved to live, then after Harjumaa, Ida-Virumaa," he added and pointed out that about 40 per cent of them have married to a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians wishing to extend their residence permit decreased.
"Hype is due to the fact that a new residence permit has been applied for permanently to move to Estonia instead of extending the residence permit," explained Rammus, Press Representative of the Ministry of the Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years.
A new residence permit for permanent admission to Estonia can be applied for by foreigners who have lived here for at least three years from the previous year.
Its aim is to encourage the stay of adapted people.
However, a long-term resident's residence permit requires, for example, five years.
Due to the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased.
For example, last year 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Now the Ukrainians can switch jobs and the Estonian state will no longer be able to see if the salary criterion has been met.
This residence permit became very popular - last year the holders of the grey passport (1029), the Russians (487), the Indians (54) and the Nigerians (36).
In total, 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese received a residence permit for the purpose of moving to Estonia in 1968.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has been surprisingly a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for the Estonian residence permit.
When three residence permits were issued to the Nigerians in 2007, 200 last year.
They're coming from Nigeria to study at these universities.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among, for example, Georgians, Chinese and Turkishs.
The number of citizens in India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely due to the migration of students.
They are also subject to the rule that where the community has emerged, there will be more easily others," Rammus added.
In ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia, for example from North Korea, from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit per year, it is about 0.46% of the total population.
Even if you think about the citizens of the European Union, migration will remain at around 1%," Maasing commented that the figures are actually small.
According to the Statistical Office, 14 822 people travelled to Estonia last year, but 13 792 out of here.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration.
The majority of immigrants are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among those who leave.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was negatively affected by 2000 people last year.

For Maria Tammeorg, however, the bottomless time of ideas is history - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream in a museum for hours and admire old sleeves and collars.
If you do something with passion, you'll study and learn more about it every day.
It's a pleasure to discover!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem to some strangers, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much shine there is in your life!
I've got a friend who's got a whole sauna full of the haute couture dresses I've created.
Because it's not his fault that he doesn't live in Hollywood and he doesn't go on a red carpet every day, and he wants to wear those most beautiful dresses, and he does!
You can live your own life special!
The fashion designer doesn't recognize the gap between the bright events and the gray day.
It was this thinking that led to the plan to take the high fashion in Estonia to rural areas, between forests and fields, to people who often do not get the fashion.
Mammu’s collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu’s fashion centre, where the 45-model Royal Defilee filled the entire street.
In Tallinn they are often taken in the hang, nodded with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere - they are crying bravo, they are standing up, they want to thank you by hand.
A lot of the audience came to reform, but now they're Mammu Couture fans.
If you go beyond people's expectations, they'll be thrilled!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer tour with my method.
We had a 50-metre-long red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, and they didn't seem to end!
Maria does not admit the fashionable fact that the work must be presented to a supersaline supermodel, she is happy to bring to the stage ordinary women.
I often invite my own clients on the stage - they have always been happy to come.
It's such a wonderful experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry I've never seen my show myself, I've always been behind the stage to give the last touch of things as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve wouldn't let me look at the hall.
Maria is the type of waymaker who wants to play not only the role of representation but also to be in everything.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection I do myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you discover.
I'm never far from my creation, and I'm not afraid of work.
It's not about design, it's about stylistics, logistics, organisation, organization, everything has to fit into the day of a woman in a temperament.
These hours of work are still huge for fanatics.
I can't tell you when my work day ends, it's just a day full of joy for me!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an endless chain of happiness: I'm doing something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and, in turn, compliments.
How many times has it been said that my dresses have magic - they make themselves feel like princesses.
Abounded feudous satires that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained Mammu Couture's signature until today.
Martin Müürsepp U18 of boys: The weapon of the Estonian sub-group tournament was now turned against us
Too bad the fairy tale's over.
The first thing I saw was we couldn't get our desk.
And when such a big difference comes in, there is nothing to do," commented Martin Müürsepp, our only basketball player, BC Kalev/Cramo, who played in the NBA to the UK.
Opponents took 28 balls from the attack table and received so many more attacks.
We weren't ready to defend them aggressively or attack, either, it created.
Many British attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build a defense.
In defense, however, they were able to keep their hands between them, and we could not combine.
It knocked the crew out of the way.
The work of the opponents was better done.
According to the mythologist, Estonia would have had to make more tactical mistakes in order to take down the attacks on the opponents.
In the last quarter, we had a zero error, but the opponents have already received several quick baskets.
Athleticism and the intense assault that was our weapon in the sub-group tournament now turned against us all.
Today, we had no power against their aggression.
The wallsmith was satisfied with his care in Kalevi, Matthias Tass.
In general, good words about the entire team can be said at the tournament; until now, a uniform blow has been made.
It's a shame you've met such an aggressive adversary before.
The cup has always been confident and played out today, but it seemed that he was tired - he's been carrying quite a burden.
But he made some pretty moves I've seen in practice before," he added.
Horrible numbers: In the girls' basketball team, the EM tournament threw less than 10 points in three quarters...
In the U18 age class, only the Emi B-division basketball tournament in Tallinn for young men, the girls started last night in Dublin.
And Estonia’s game with Poland unfortunately hit the field of anti-registers.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter the position was 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes took the opponents off the gas pedal, and that period remained on the tie 16:16.
In both the first and the second quarter, Estonia threw 4, at the third point...
In the beginning, Estonians hit two of the first four shots in two minutes, and then 25 in the game, then one in three, and then 21 in the shot...
Maybe in almost half an hour, one of 47 shots was caught.
In addition, two out of four free throws came.
There were a reasonable number of ball losses during this time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland had a drop-off rate of 33 per cent and Estonia had 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has begun with two losses, on the day of the opening, it had to be recognised that Portugal was 83:56.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to complete supplies
Today, NATO's 1st permanent mine control group arrived in Tallinn for a scheduled port visit to complete the ship's supplies and prepare for the next exercises.
During the visit, ships will prepare for return to the sea, while giving crew members the opportunity to take a couple of days’ leave.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out several exercises and be ready for future historical explosive search operations.
"The participation of the Estonians in the NATO unit and their cooperative training in local waters are a good example of our integration with the Allied Forces," said Major-General Arto Reinmaa of the Operations and Planning Department in the role of Commander of the Navy.
Since 29 June, NATO will lead the 1st permanent mine control group, led by Latvian Marine Lieutenant General Gvido Laudups, who took over the group commander's duties at the ceremony in Riga from the Estonian Navy Officer, Lieutenant Johan-Elias, from Seljamaa.
The group's flagship is designated as a Latvian marine support vessel in LVNS Virsait, which is also operated by the group's command post.
This semester, the Estonian Navy Mining Hunter Sakala is also part of the international unit.
One of the four groups of vessels under the NATO Marine Command is NATO’s 1st standing mine control team, one of the primary rapid responders, which the Alliance can send to various locations in the world within five days.
Until August 4-13, the ancient ruins of Pirita's monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, which was launched 13 years ago by Maestro Eri Klas, will be held.
According to Risto Joosti (36), the artistic director of Tallinn Philharmonic, this year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The classics of the opera world include "Travita" and "Tosca", the ballerinas from the enchanting "Bolerost" to the fun "Karlsson", and there is also no lack of own production from the scheme, which is this time the performance by the same international creative team of Joseph Haydn's wonderful orarium, who brought to the stage the second film "Creation" by Pirital Haydn in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre performances.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It's a festival whose charm takes control and never let go again.
Because the experience of the listener in this sublime and mysterious environment makes the human souls sound and touches the human senses in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the first year of the Birgitta Festival.
Didn't the maestro Eri Klas' shoes seem a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it's been very helpful.
He led me through my entire student career and supported me at the beginning of my career as a director.
Maybe that's why it makes it easier for me to continue his work.
The Special Class has injected such a great deal of goodness into the Birgitta Festival team, and of course it will all be transferred to me.
It was great to join a team who knows exactly how things work.
It was Eri Klas’ big heart that gave me the strength to move on with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am now, and I can do it!
What could excite the audience this year at the festival, what is your special offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, as a surprise, the first ballet written on Astrid Lindgren's story will be presented.
It's "Karlsson flies."
And one criminal nuance about this is that the composer of this ballet is Juris Karlsons, the composer of Latvia, who himself expressed a desire to write this work.
Apparently, he's had Karlsson's character since he was a kid.
Risto, how can you handle all this?
Thanks to my supportive life mate, I'm sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have it.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions aren't as dependent on other people as I may be on myself, how I'm going to deal with every new day.
And such conscious keeping a tone, keeping positive and actually smiling at yourself in the morning mirror, significantly increased my luck percentage.
Especially this week, when there are the most important samples, I have been particularly busy practicing it and it works.
Smiling at yourself activates the brain and increases tone.
It's not just a word.
I don't think people know half the things about their bodies that the universe offers them, but they're all about to discover it.
Now, it's an important moment.
Do you have any rituals before you enter the conductor's remote?
Yes, we do. We need to change for the more comfortable ones.
It's this little moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest before the big show or take a nap.
In fact, I even like to talk to people actively, even before they enter the conductor's remote.
But all of you, come to the Birgitta Festival, here's something to discover for a friend of not a very large opera and ballet!
Watch the moody video with Risto Joost!
New results of the assessment tests of the age of Swedish acyl seekers were published
In Sweden, a test was carried out to assess their age with an innovative approach. The latest results of the test show that more than 80 percent of those tested were assessed older than 18 but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Judicial Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing towards the beginning of this year.
The tests were set up for a more accurate assessment of age in the process of applying for azyl after the Swedish Migrationsverket was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly minors.
To date, 6880 cases have been sent to the test by Migrationsverket and a total of 2,481 tests have been issued by the Institute of Justice between mid-March 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 years old or older, and in 25 other cases, the Institute of Justice assessed that the test could be "may be 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is "presumably younger than 18".
The tests shall be used only if the age of the person is questionable.
According to Johan Göransson, working at the Institute of forensics, the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"We don't see a big difference from last month's statistics, the numbers are quite consistent," he said to The Local.
The fact that the majority of cases were considered older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asyl seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued 581 tests in May and said that in 442 cases, "there are indications that the person under investigation is 18 years of age or older".
But when Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that 243 cases were directly claimed by man to be 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, which involves X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee joints, is then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the sceptics is the endocrinologist of the Karolinska Institute Claude Marcus, whose duties include the assessment of human biological maturity in order to determine whether they passed the puberty sooner or later.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the method currently used should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he said to the Metro newspaper.
But Johan Göransson, from the Institute of Criminal Medicine, protected the accuracy of the tests: "In general it can be said that the risk of imprecise adultisation of the child is low.
The greatest risk, perhaps at about 10%, is when a person is a little less than 18."

20-year-old hammer thrower Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut in London MM, getting a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was the youngest female hammerer of MM, and a joyful woman confirmed that she was hoping to fight for the medals in the future.
The race went well and I got a good experience.
The first test (64.80) immediately produced my average result, the second (62.80) I risked too much and the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," said Orel after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm really glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's M.M. Debut ended in a good 18th place.
The rainfall didn't interfere with the Orel because he's training through the TUT stadium in winter.
"I'm scratched," he said with a little bitch.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house of people, did Orel sense people around him or could turn himself off?
I got it, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it gives more - that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he would be satisfied with the M.M. Debut and that he would still have a lot of good competitions: "I came here this year with the 32nd or last result, I finished in 18.
This is a very good result.
I'm 20 years old and MM. It's the only thing that matters.
I'm taking on a good experience, and I want to compete for the medals some day.
Governor of West Virginia announced a party change
Western Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced at a meeting with President Trump on Thursday night that he was changing parties.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I say to you, having prayed and thought about it a great deal... today I say to you, the West Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
At the gathering, the cry of joy broke out.
"This will make me Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a trainer, I'd tell you it's time to play another game."
Trump had previously promised a great announcement at the meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and that he inherited coal from his father.
His value is about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, on Thursday evening, the National Committee of the Republicans (RNC) announced that "the exchange of Governor Justice is another blow to the democratic parties, which would prevent the country from being made better than to work for it".
"From the 15 governors and the control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent rejection of parties that have been run from end to end and cannot find a positive and connecting message," said Ronna McDaniel, President of RNC in a statement to CBS News.
Not surprisingly, there are many people who are injured.
Urmet, in the weekly medical tent, told the evening paper yesterday that they had to share quite a lot of patches.
The forks and grapples are fundamental, out of twists and light falls.
Of course, the headaches, back and foot.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes, and that's how the problems come.
Medics have also had to help a couple of more injured visitors - there have been some panic attacks and also a fracture in the leg.
We have also sewn when a person has broken a hand or finger.
Smaller stitches are done here, bigger ones are sent to the hospital.
Check the video to see if the festive doctors ask for a painkiller to treat the hangover.
Coe said the Russians were really sorry about the doping canal.
According to him, the international noseman of the force, Sebastian Coe, approved the "Russia's honest Thursday apology" for the doping canal, but he repeated that this is not the time to allow the country back to sport.
The Russian noseman Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAF Congress that the ban on competition imposed on his country was correct and that he had a certain aim of fighting doping.
He apologized to "all the lightweights who've had gold and silver medals at the competitions."
In spite of his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban on competition introduced in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to journalists.
"The Health Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Alliance itself also admitted that they had quite a difficult time and that they were doing everything possible to restructure the Union."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted its restoration criteria.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place, but Congress supports the Group's proposal that this is not the time to withdraw Russia," said Coe.
"We need to do everything we can in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always been based on the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from a corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian lightweights who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF will compete as neutral athletes in the world championships starting on Friday in London.
Rune Andersen, Head of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia is not yet meeting several recovery criteria.
After a presentation to the IAF Council, he told the journalists in London that doping control is still inadequate and that banned trainers are still operating freely.
The revolution of electric cars makes a significant difference in the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
Not only does the revolution of electric cars significantly change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, but it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining gigs like Glencore can say that they win and lose from one place, smaller mining companies are not helped.
Glencore is currently serving coal and oil, but in the future, in the era of electric cars, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will increase.
This year, the United Kingdom, France and Norway have made contributions to the spread of electric cars, allowing the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades.
Therefore, Volvo has already known that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine and that Tesla will bring a cheaper Model 3 electric car to the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that more electric cars are being sold for two decades than cars using oil-produced fuels.
"With regard to some metals, this changes everything," said the raw materials analyst for Capital Economics to Simona Gambrani Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cave and lithium, the demand for which has increased for years.
Electric cars have about three times more copper than conventional cars, reported Glencore.
More copper is needed at loading stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that it will increase copper demand by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in the demand for electric car batteries means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glencore receives revenue from the growing trend of electric cars from the copper price increase and the fact that it is the world's largest cobalt producer, estimated by the Jefferies Group.
According to this broker company, the other winners of the race for electric cars are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, 70 percent of the cave on the London Metal Exchange has become expensive.
Last year's price increase was 37 percent.
Copper has also increased by 14% this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's stock increased by 20 percent in London, overcoming the price rise in Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billitoni and Anglo America.
On the loser side, lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine have to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of lead is the power-driven batteries for the starter of petrol and diesel-powered cars.
Electric cars use lithium ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to the plinting, unless it is found to be for other purposes that could overcome the fall in demand," said Michael Widmer, the head of the metal market in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The price movement of lead has not yet seen the effect of a breaking-down trend.
Lead has increased by 17 percent this year, which is the best metal in London, among the main industrial metals.
Investors will only see problems with metal in the far future.
"I'm not sure that lead is so bad, because cheap oil keeps regular cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager of Triland Metals.
If the demand for lead falls, it will happen slowly.
Maybe that's what's gonna happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, stricter exhaust standards mean that demand for hybrid cars will increase, depending on the lead-based batteries developed in the frequent start-up of engines, will be assessed by the international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel, as a lighter car can drive further with less electricity.
This explains the additional aluminium demand of 1,6 million tonnes until 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 percent of the world's total production of aluminium.
This trend is likely to get worse, said Widmer.
Aluminium has increased by 13 per cent this year, as increasing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is cooperating with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce light car shells.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to resist aluminium.
"Advanced steel should be the answer to this development," said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal was used as catalysts for diesel-powered cars, reported metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"Many of the raw materials currently in high demand, such as oil and platinum, may not have high demand in the future," said Natixis' raw materials analyst Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that the raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe that the demand for diesel hybrid cars will continue.
The Uncore leader, Marc Grynberg, said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold from full electric cars.
In the 10-year term, the high hope of platinum manufacturers is for cars based on hydrogen elements developed by the Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motors, which depend on platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
So far, however, this technology has not yet commercially justified itself.
"Disel seems to have a clear loser on his way to electric cars," said Exane BNP of Paribas, Brunet.
German car manufacturers suffered a major setback in July, as the Stuttgart Court banned the use of diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football financial rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's world-class record transition from the Spanish football club to the Paris-Saint Germain club in Barcelona.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that rules the European game and which has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, are still ahead of Paris Saint-Germain.
The UEFA financial rules for fair play (FFP) established in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar’s transition was financed without huge losses.
EUR 222 million (EUR 262 million) was paid to Barcelona to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar's salary will reach tens of millions of dollars per year.
Here are some financial aspects of the transfer of Neymar to the French club.
The PSG will undoubtedly be able to issue such money to recruit Neymar and add it to its starry line, given that the team is funded by a family of Katari's energy rich family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot on recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out with their own football players.
FFP was set up after Michel Platinum was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into large debts in their search of success would actually deal with fraud and risk ruining if banks or owners had to give up their support.
As of 2011, FFP will focus on monitoring these losses rather than on the debts of the clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich used first in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and then to spend a lot of money on making the team better and creating a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
FFP may bear losses of up to EUR 30 million during the current three-year assessment period, which runs until 2018.
And despite Platinum's disgraceful rejection of the Presidential Office in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Cefer, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," said Andrea Traverso to the Associated Press last week, who is the supervisor of FFP at UEFA.
While the PSG paid for the Neymar takeover clause as a single total payment, it is possible for them to divide this amount into instalments for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract and therefore it is possible to show the transitional fee in the next five years as an amount of EUR 44,4 million per year.
In the case of the first wave of FFP sanctions, in 2014, PSG, together with Abu Dhabi’s Manchester City, received the most severe penalties.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million (at present USD 82 million), which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to limit the Masters League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to plan over regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their income through companies related to the owners of the club.
Although the company may sponsor PSG, if the sponsorship value is considered to be above the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the support for Qatar Tourism Authority PSG had been uplifted.
It has been said that some of Neymar’s PSG’s services can come from Katar through the payments of the 2022 World Championships Management Committee.
However, PSG and Katar 2022 deny that Neymar could become the ambassador of the World Championships and argue that UEFA regulators could easily reveal such manoeuvre.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in any attempt to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not discussed the transition with PSG to Neymar proactively.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is ensured because they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest reports show that PSG made a profit of more than EUR 10 million during the 2015-2016 season at a turnover of around EUR 542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship transactions, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase of at least 30 % in turnover in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the largest football stars, sought to prevent Neymar from moving, claiming that PSG was in breach of FFP.
"This is a clear "monetary doping" case with the club and the state," said La League President Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG belongs mainly to Katar.
Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal Manager, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga’s view that the State finances the club.
"This is the consequence of property rights and has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of an honest game because the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a great player."
Norwegian low-cost airline Norwegian has a nice tradition of putting images of those who have moved borders in their own field and been inspired by others, writes trip.ee
Along with the expansion of Norwegian operational geography, the circle of people who have earned a seat on the plane swing has also expanded.
The selected persons include Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (on the picture) and Miguel de Cervantes.
In the near future, however, a plane will be decorated with the portrait of Queen’s legendary singer Freddie Mercury.
Today 50 years ago: a storm of hurricane size in Estonia, which ripped the roofs and windows from the houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which caused major damage to the West, Harjumaa and Raplamaa in particular on 6 and 7 August.
In the north-west of Estonia, the wind was over 30 m/s during these days.
My old man ran from one curved tree to another in the garden and touched them with his hands to support them.
It was dark and radical, like the end of the world.
The roofs were already flying from the houses, and in 2002, old lady Linda Kurova reminded of Haapsalus magazine in an interview with Estonian Nature.
Linda's husband saw the garden she planted collapse.
But what do you keep supporting the trees with your hands where you can fight a storm like this?
The sea came under the window, from the windows sprayed in the water," said Mrs. Linda, who lived on Kalda Street at the time.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station platform had flown 20-30 meters away, Linda saw most of the Haapsalus just like the next morning.
According to locals, trees behind Paralepa were down, some completely down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went through a war with beautiful old trees like a rag and a crack.
Western-Virumaa did not suffer particularly hard in August 1967, compared to West Estonia, but the damage was also great there, wrote the Virumaa Journal in 2007.
The Castle Park of Haapsalu and Padis Park were wiped out of the ground, but the parks in our area were also severely affected.
In Tallinn, the wind was measured at a speed of up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
On the evening of August 6th in Tallinn, a little girl called out: "Mom, Mom!
The chickens are in the air and can't get down anymore," wrote the Virumaa Journal.
The Põll Manor building, located in Viljandi, was destroyed during the storm, so that it was later decided to be demolished.
The construction of the Türi ski jump mountain, which was no longer restored later, could not withstand the August storm.
On August 12, 1967, the newspaper Red Star wrote that the cleaning of cities and settlements from fallen trees and their branches would progress slowly, and that the residents would be able to contribute to the cleaning work.
In the storm, crop fields were also severely affected, and the newspaper stated that "the organization of parties must be incentivised and directed by both the repair and the harvest".
Hurricanes can be discussed if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of the low wind in Estonia lasts from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul was measured at 48 m/s.
The measuring instrument broke down on the island of Onlydloo, so the wind speed measured could not be accurately recorded.
Secret of clean beaches: night-time cleaning and poor beach weather
Colder summer worlds also mean a smaller harvest in Tallinn's bathing areas.
"If it's the weather, people are on the beach, and if it isn't, there's no people," says the beach cleaner.
The seagulls are screaming at the beach of Strom in North Tallinn.
They are offered a melodic competition with a low-speed tractor that plows stripes off the platter.
In fact, the last screens through the sand at a depth of six inches [7 cm], picking out the scrap of the sea and the scrap of people left behind: bottle caps, cigarettes, and so forth.
People are still coming to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If it's a beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if it's not, there's no people," says Alexander Usov, Head of the Law Office of the Haabersti Beach.
It's 6:30 p.m., and there's a bitter cleaning job on the beach, because at 8:00, the place has to be fine for people.
Usov's on the job by 4:00.
In addition to Strom, he will keep an eye on the shores of Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe, and Paljasari Pikakar.
Landfills have decreased.
Years ago, it was much more.
People can now appreciate what is being done for them," says Usov, who has been cleaning the beaches for 15 years.
It used to be that when something new got up, it was broken the next day.
They're already keeping what's on the beach.
Price of the clean beach
One of the biggest works on the shores of Estonia is the cleaning of the sea waste, or apron, washed to the shore.
For example, 400 000 tons of it must be transported to the beach on the coast of Pirita.
"This is an incredible amount," notes Usov.
Another major category is municipal waste, or all that people leave behind.
There are eight large garbage containers on the one - and - a - half - mile - long - mile - long Strom coastline that need to be emptied three times a week.
So much garbage.
However, colder summer worlds have meant that the garbage is one fifth less than otherwise.
The third category consists of abandoned goods.
These are mostly children's lives.
As this harvest, Usov's got a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They'll be waiting for the owners to take the beach to the woods.
"They usually come out more, but it's a normal catch." Usov already knows that soon he'll find them back in the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them again in the sand.
Disperse the trash
Erika Scholler, representative of Haaberst’s administrative services, admits that the tractor’s screening work is disrupted by local residents.
The noise that lasts from the hours of the night to the morning interferes with the sleep of the people living in the neighborhood.
But it's impossible in the day.
In one month, the beach has to be screened twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," says Scholler.
However, the aim is, like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu, to get the beach of Strom under the international quality mark of blue flag.
"There is much more work in Estonia than Europe to ensure that the beaches are maintained," says Scholler.
We've got more adrifts and stones, and it's harder to screen the sand.
However, there are fewer garbage on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Hearing that there is talk of garbage on the beach, Martin, who lives near the beach of Strom, is bound to enter the conversation circle between the journalist and the cleaning workers, highlighting the current bottlenecks of the beach.
There's a gross picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle collectors who've pulled the garbage bags up," says Martin.
While it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour so far, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about the garbage cans and, for example, put on covers to prevent at least birds from reforming there.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of the Beach of Strom.
It's obvious that the city will take care of it.
With children’s fields, illuminated and freshly asphalted teas, it has become more pleasant.
Once upon a time, there was only one way to drive on roller skates," notes Martin.
Treasurer’s findings in Strom: coins, only coins
The 40-year-old Dimitri, who, as a treasurer, is combing the edge with a metal detector, has come to take advantage of the morning.
He doesn't think he'll find anything valuable today or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough for this.
"I've been dealing with this for a year, and so far I've found nothing of value," says Dmitri.
As a hoiaardecüt, Dmitri’s treasure bag has some euro coins, bottle caps, and also dangerous nails that will later throw into the trash.
Usually, there's still coins.
"Darling, no rings or anything like that," states the treasure hat.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to be notified that interest rates will remain at the same level as before, as insatiable economic growth and inflation relief have softened speculation as a result of the increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to deteriorate, as households' tight incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The policy makers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of keeping the rates at 6:2 at 0.25%, and fewer members call for an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its growth forecast by 1.7% in 2017 and by 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on households' incomes will remain, as inflation is still expected to rise by 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank also indicated that the increase in rates will be necessary to contain inflation due to Brexit over the next few years and that a higher increase in credit costs than expected on the financial markets may be necessary.
The members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package, which was launched as a result of Brexit a year ago.
In February, the Bank will close the fixed-term financing scheme, which will offer low-cost financing to banks, although it said that it is now expected that 15 billion pounds will be tendered to GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says: "In the medium-term forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) will be incapable in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household income will continue to have an impact on consumption."
With regard to the rates, it has been repeated that, in order to mitigate inflation, it is necessary to "twitch some of the tensions of monetary policy" and to "a little greater" than is expected on the markets.
The stock exchange is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any jumps were gradual and limited.
The bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and the following year are comparable to May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast of 1.8% growth in 2018 remained stable.
After this news, the pound exchange rate for the dollar and the euro fell.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators, which have silenced the growing expectations of an increase in GDP in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will start to grow slightly.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to cheer up households suffering from rising inflation and a miserable wage rise, saying that the situation is getting a little worse before recovery.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent a hit on income in the next few years, but a marked recovery in wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weakness of the pound, the growing demand for British production will also stimulate the economy, partly reimbursing lower costs for consumers.
The decision will come one year after rates were taken last August 0.25% after the shocking EU referendum, leading to a sudden decline in the pound.
According to the Bank, it is likely that it will take four years to fully inhale prices and the economy.
Before the last decision was taken, there was a growing demand for higher rates, as inflation had increased pressure on households in distress; in July, three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell by 2.6% last month compared to 2.9% in June, although it was expected to rise again in the coming months, in the words of the bank.
The bank said that the excessive increase compared with the 2-percent target was due to a totally weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco's mortgage brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming increasingly competitive again, as lenders want to work and hope to finish the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are going to be concluded, as refinancing, often non-service and low rates, has become increasingly popular."
NHS is about to prescribe an HIV medicine for 10,000 people.
From September onwards, patients will have access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after the battle in the Supreme Court on whether NHS should finance the medicine.
NHS England reported that public health now makes an estimated 10,000 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) tablets available to humans during the initial three-year clinical trial, which have shown a reduction of the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk people.
The NHS agreed to finance the clinical trial after the Appellate Tribunal supported the Supreme Court’s decision last year to be able to pay for PrEP, despite the Authority’s own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities instead.
Simon Stevens, Executive Director of NHS England, welcomed this move announced on Thursday as a "new comprehensive intervention", while the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as a "reversible moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October there will be more clinics before the programme is implemented everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medicines that is taken before a relationship to reduce the risk of infection with HIV.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual activity means that there are sufficient amounts of certain medicines in the human body that prevent infection with HIV.
Such medicines can be taken every day or not later than two hours before your sexual activity.
The treatment candidates include homosexual or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment.
The clinics identify suitable people who are willing to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgenders and those whose HIV partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor can also register their wish to participate in the local sexual health clinic participating in the program.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to get the drugs this week after the international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of who the medicinal product is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new comprehensive intervention should complement and amplify the widespread and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in the struggle for more than three decades with one of mankind's greatest health problems."
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT, said: "This is a turning moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is properly targeted at those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to change the British HIV epidemic.
Since September, people at high risk of HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool, which is individually manageable and does not depend on negotiations with a partner, through this clinical trial funded by NHS, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "Now it is essential to ensure that clinical trials over the country are rapidly rejected and that no members of the HIV risk group are excluded.
Now that the clinical trial drug for PrEP has been acquired, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of being infected with HIV.
The shadow minister of public health, Sharon Hodgson, said: "The beginning of the clinical trial at PrEP is very welcome and very late after months of delays and the drag of the government's feet.
Evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring about in order to stop HIV prevention and its life-changing infection.
This clinical trial will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the advantages of the PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial be conducted as soon as possible across the country to protect people with HIV contact and to bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
The price of electricity increased by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania the price of electricity fell.
In July, the difference in the price of electricity for the next day's stock exchange between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros this June, said Elering.
The main reason for the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
The average exchange price of electricity in Estonia was EUR 34,33 per megawatt-hour last month and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, prices fell by five per cent from EUR 36,27 per megawatt hour.
The price in Finland was EUR 34,17 and the Nord Pool system price was EUR 26,37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and 7 per cent, respectively.
Electricity between Estonia and Finland moved 75 per cent of the hours of the previous month towards Estonia and 16 per cent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not take place the following day.
Electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved 99 per cent of the time from Estonia to Latvia, and 73 per cent of the hours had full transmission capacity.
According to the transactions on the last trading day of July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the electricity exchange price in August can be around EUR 34 and in September 37 per megawatt-hour.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the production price of electricity increased last month and transactions were made at a price of EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
Living a life - half-storey and smart design tips have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leone, a former banker who is a passionate real estate refurbisher, replaced his large Knightsbridge home in 2014 with Earls Court's apartment.
It's on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and resold her apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with a former life partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
They showed me this Earls Court apartment, and it had the same high charges.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a complete innovation.
In the beginning it was a single bedroom and a complex apartment - to reach the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half floor to use high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands," he said.
He hired Duck & Shed, an architectural and design studio in Erfan Azadi Notting Hill, to use the ceilings of 3.8 m high and to create a home that would not just be a developmental object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a half floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
"Metal construction is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to reorganise the rooms so they would be on top of each other without having to bend.
It wasn't just the construction of the platform, but we used the steel structure so that the height of both the upper and lower spaces would be correct."
This setting allowed Erfan to create two rooms with full height on top of each other with a lot of dramatic elements.
From the half floor, the old-fashioned, copper-lighted retrouvisius window opens to a glamourous living space under the view.
The golden furniture, silver details and the retro-flashing Serge Mouille lighting emphasizing the space style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in increasing theatrical, spatial and brightness.
There are mirrors attached to both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror makes the back wall look like a window opening in another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage place for all Joanne’s cutlery and glassware.
The living room has a chance to close the kitchen if it is not used, creating an image of a more glamorous room.
Convenient kitchens are nothing new.
At this kitchen, however, is a unique fact that it is a garage type lift door.
"It took a little bit of planning to do that," Erfan explains from a dedicated MDF door with steel strength.
"It's got a counterweight, which is why it slides very easily when it's pushed up."
Due to the smart use of the room and storage room, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"At the end of the day, the floor is what you sell - or what gives value to the property," says Erfan.
"The real estate broker enters an out-of-date room and makes calculations based on the surface area."
Here they have been able to increase the floor surface by using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"The materials are the ones you touch and thereby help to create an emotional bond with your home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the heart ring."
This shows that good design and enhanced area help make a fairly normal apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may actually cause a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a bounty hunter in the Chicago skyscraper who is competing with a colleague for promotion.
All that matters is the amount of money you earn, and you forget all about ethics.
A man sees his wife and three children only early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I get the idea that it's a version of the business world of the Card House - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech manager are similar.
As the film goes on, the less the frame house element remains, and the moralizing intention of the filmmakers is becoming increasingly apparent.
A life-changing experience is the cancer of the main character’s son.
Now we have to make a choice between working and family life.
A son dreaming of architectural office makes his father walk to the big buildings of Chicago to think about things that are really important, such as faith, goodness, love... not even the disaster of the twin towers.
After the third scene where the son opens his father’s eyes, it is felt that the filmmakers are determined to make the audience cry for sure, because even the toughest one in the heart cannot hold back tears in the face of the suffering of a dear cancer - sick boy.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, his father finally understands the immorality of his work and does good work for the old man seeking work.
Now I'm betting on myself - if the film has a happy self, I'll reward my insight after the movie with coffee, but if I'm wrong, the screenwriter can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a suspicion I'm gonna be missing coffee when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and he's running slow down the hall to the room.
Yet, the son is wonderfully healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it will prove to be positive, for now is the time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can predict the end of American drama quite well already!
When giving the truth honor, the film is well-designed, all the elements necessary for it exist.
Can cry, can laugh, actors are good and moral beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure this movie will bring it in well.
Trump's new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can handle it.
In that case, he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trumpin, including news, in the hope that it will keep the Chief in a smoother water.
Here's a break from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior officials on his first working day, he highlighted the key problem at President Donald Trump's White House, which he was planning to solve in the hands of the President.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to pass through him, whether on paper or at meetings, because the President would make better decisions if he had been given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it, and they've failed to control Trump by monitoring her media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV viewing habits have not gone anywhere.
"If the candidate Trump was upset about the unfair media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also honestly reflected in the affected publications," said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "six former campaign workers said that the key to managing Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a stable singing of praise".
All right.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits have ever been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know that Trump's twigs would have been even more triggering without their intervention.
We'll probably never find out about the tweaks Trump didn't mail.
If his assistants could save him even a few times from trouble, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to keep Trump from constantly creating no-minds.
Part of the problem is that people in the White House, consisting of competing clicks, are trying to promote their own interests without exception by providing Trump with material that supports their world views, but may not always be reliable.
In May, Politico, which reflects the whole story, wrote advice about the tendency of advisors to feed the president with strategically questionable information.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"The present and former Trump subordinates say that Trump can react to negative press, particularly harmful information leaks, explosively, by obsessing about their source.
This was also the case at the end of February when someone was happy to give the President a printed copy of the article of Charles C. Johnson's website, GotNews.com, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being a "source of multiple leaks" of the White House.
It doesn't matter if Johnson's been permanently blocked from Twitter as a result of mutilation, or if he didn't offer any concrete evidence, or if he's made false accusations in the past and withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, and Head of the White House's Office, Rob Porter, "have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents available to Trump."
How'd it work out?
Kelly's trying to do exactly the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader of Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad don't get permission to perform.
There are many foreigners playing in Tallinn city centre.
Those with whom the Evening Journal spoke admitted that they were playing in the Old Town without the city’s permission.
The first thing we found was three street musicians near the gates of Viru who had taken the same number of dogs with them.
It was clear that musicians with rascals and broken clothes were backpack travelers who could use a shower.
Despite his appearance, the only woman in the company played a story with a fun rhythm on the accordion, while one man next to him played with three balls and invited passers closer.
The third man had sat next to them on a backpack and the peace of heart smoked itself into a twisted joint.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing crowd.
Bob, who played the accordion with Noem and the balls, said they were playing on the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the society’s performance was to collect ticket money for a ship travelling to Finland on the evening of the same day.
The question is, did they ask the city for permission to play in the old town, shake Noem and Bob's head?
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or two, and mostly permits will be granted for a month or something like that.
There's no point in paying for that," explained Bob.
When we got back to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were at the musicians' house and drove them away.
The society moved with backpacks and dogs to the Viru Center intersection to try luck.
There were also three Polish young men on Viru Street, one of whom played violin, the other clarinet, and the other one had brought the electronic piano.
"We are here to give people entertainment to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and housing," explained the trio pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware of the need for city government permission to perform.
"Of course we don't have it," he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we'll go somewhere else, but we'll have to try," he added.
Eesti Pank purchased EUR 149 million of bonds under the public sector asset purchase programme of the euro area central banks in July, and the bank's bond portfolio increased to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank shall not disclose any more detailed information on purchases.
The Governor of Eesti Pank Hardo Hansson has previously explained that the Eurosystem central banks' asset purchase plan covers three different purchase programmes: covered bonds, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and PSPP.
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Purchases will lead to a fall in the return on lower-risk assets, which will motivate investors to take higher risks.
As a general rule, in the framework of the public bond purchase programme, each central bank buys the bonds of its national government, and other national bonds are not purchased.
Since the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank will make so-called replacement purchases within the limits of the volume allocated to them.
Substituting purchases are also carried out by central banks in countries where the offer of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank usually buys bonds from the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank will purchase bonds under the asset purchase programme as of March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering's bonds were also purchased, but since June 2016, Eesti Pank no longer buys Elering's bonds.
As of June, both Elering and Eesti Energia will purchase bonds from the central bank of Finland on behalf of the central banks of the euro area.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to the "Millionaire Division"
Some of the richest homeowners in the West Midlands have once again been confronted with fierce opposition from determined travelers who have ignored the ditch dug by the council to win back the field away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 trailer resorts in the field for a wealthy "millionaire district" near Solihull Street.
They have returned with the army of horses, children, and trucks since they were kicked out of there in May, without having to get mixed up in the ditch that was dug up by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak spot within the protection limits by squeezing their vehicles through an uninhibited part of the road that had been left on the road.
The angry people have been cursing the Solihull Council, saying that the council is "unusual to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after their deportation from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers.
The Council must be ashamed that they will act because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back again.
There were more of them last night, probably even more today."
He added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to the protection of its parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook and I'm not happy that I have to continue paying the commission if the council can't even stop such a thing."
A local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said: "This is ridiculous. We just saw the last of these travelers leave, and there is already a new attack.
This time, the number has increased and even the horse has been seen in the grassland.
The representative of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that in a country near the Streetsbrook road there is an unacceptable camp site and we are cooperating with the Solihull police. We are taking the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
The collection of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling number 101.
This will help create an image of the situation for the court if we present the case to them."
The Weekend festival is also visited by Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, among others, who is pleased that the real world's top names have been brought to Estonia.
The question why the Weekend festival is so important for Estonians is answered by Saar, that it should be asked by all those who enjoy the three-day talk of the festival in full.
Yet, he acknowledges that real people have arrived in Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that has been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute titles of this musical genre will be delivered home - this is not often the case in our community," says the Minister of Culture.
What artists perform at the festival, however, speak most of the island itself?
I think I'm a relatively old man, and for old people like me, there's definitely one of the most experienced artists, Armin van Buuren, who got up last night.
According to his record, we've all been on our own at some point," he says.
But he'll bring out a number of other names, like Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonians too: starting with NO.o.p. and being read a whole series of them.
In fact, this well-known concentration of names is very high," he says.
Take a closer look at the evening paper video!
Audi renews up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of the criticism of car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would offer software supplementation for more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to BMW's chairman, the company believes that "there are more intelligent alternatives than travel restrictions", referring to European cities, including BMW's hometown, Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce the emissions of diesel engines.
No company described these operations as recall.
European car manufacturers have been eager to promote the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide from diesel engines is considered to be a carcinogen and may cause asthma.
The cost of equipment installed to neutralise exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles for automotive companies will also increase, making it difficult to keep car prices competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under in-depth investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of spoiling the powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's errors, which silenced the use of so-called deceiving devices, which allowed the exhaust gas reading to be adapted to the regulations while the car was tested, but withdrew under normal driving conditions.
Several heads of Volkswagen have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics sub-unit of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zachheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may go to trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was dragged to the criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when the authorities accused the audit of installing the system to circumvent the requirements of European emissions of gases, thereby extending the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of the audit in the investigation can be a major blow to Volkswagen’s luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionately large proportion of Volkswagen’s profits.
For 20 000 euros, European Union flags will be purchased for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
A total of 105x158 cm will receive 570 educational institutions of the European Union flag.
The flags are intended to be displayed in indoor spaces, they must be carried out in high-quality printing equipment in indoor spaces with tunnel fasteners, and the ERR news portal is transmitted.
The label of the flagpole contains the text: "A certificate for Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of the 570 tickets is EUR 20 000, or one ticket costs EUR 35.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing danger in Mexico
The Riodoce employees usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But today they are gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They're told it's important to change their routines.
Two senior writers discuss which one seems safer: either bring the children to the office, which was the target of the grenade attack in 2009, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard at the top of the room: "Peaces", "neutrals", "Allies".
They ask reporters to provide names in each column to provide no evidence, enough impressions and inner feelings.
The government's or cartel's wages suspect drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists a whole list of bad guys who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
There are no break in the spirit of violence, and the more bodies gather across the country, the majority of them being reported by journalists by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists as being at least 25,589 journalists after attacks and threats in December 2012 and, during this year, at least seven journalists in seven states have been killed.
The latter include their editor and source of inspiration, the co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence gives a deep feeling, although his presence can be perceived anywhere in the Riodoce building, with a large picture of the average finger-showing Valdez with the letter "Justice" and two 30-year-old reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts with his smiled face or his typical Colony hat.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters will discuss common trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate public prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, only two cases have been held liable according to the Journalists’ Protection Committee.
As with most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, which reach thousands, journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodoce continues to reflect violence in Sinalo, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, a meeting on security without the records of murderers and justice is of little use.
"It's very stupid to waste your time at this meeting," he says.
"As long as there's no reason to know, you're going to confide in everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the capital of the state, on 15 May.
He only managed to drive a couple of blocks before two men stopped him from red Toyota Corola, forced to leave the car and shot him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which translates into the "Twelfth River".
An armed man drove away in Valdez's car and crashed near it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left behind by a woman and two grown-up children.
Rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez’s subject basically only has silence.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the execution of the United States in January, Mustalu has been one of the most bloody battle fields in the country, because rival clicks are fighting to fill the power vacuum.
No matter how many people, or even many, are shot every day in the streets of Sinaloa, or how the cemetery is filled with two - folded mausoleums of drug kings that are larger than the homes of many living.
Let us forget for a moment that peacetime refers to the fact that there is only one cartel running a state along the sea with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers involved in his work, the co-founder and director of Riodoce, Ismail Bojorquez (60), felt enormous sympathy that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to the killing.
The first of them was the publication in February of an interview with the noseman Damaso Lopez, who was competing with the sons of Guzman and a war-footed cartel.
This copy may have upset the boys as soon as they reached the newspaper booths, all copies of the publications were purchased by suspected gang members.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid in another newspaper that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing was seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been alive for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always exist.
He worked as a veteran reporter for the newspaper Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that in Sinaloa, "it was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem."
In time, the paper gained a reputation with its bold and honest reflections and increased sales and advertising.
The reporters enjoyed publishing intense studies without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication that allowed them to read stories that no one else dared to read.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for her Latin American reflections.
In the same year, the Valdez Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) won the International Freedom of the Press Prize for its courage to follow the Mexican history of drugs wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said when he received the AKK award.
Last October, he told the television channel Rompevieto TV in an interview that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to assume the task that the Journalist Board has to carry out is to play a fool.
I don't want to be asked what I did when I faced so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on."
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, a joker who was rocking like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared embassies and counsel, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went across the street from the office to the El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love became fatal to him.
His death has also led them to doubt how best to do their job and to stay alive.
"They don't like it when you mess with their women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things were not to be touched," said Bojorquez.
Even in the best times, the result is strong self - control and self - control.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, said that the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules in Sinaloa are no longer in force, just as they do not apply to Tamaulipass, Krakow, Guerrero and other states, which are home to a toxic association of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt public officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce’s employees met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that only government-selling spyware had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two policemen were looking for relief from 40 degrees of heat in the tree's shadow.
The government appointed them to guard Riodoce's office, located in a four-storey building in the middle-class neighbourhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered if these police officers were one of the 50 percent police officers whose governor himself has labeled untrustworthy.
Several months have passed since reporters have traveled to mountainous lands where control is de facto held by drug gangs.
Riodoce’s edition of this week covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinalo.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor’s hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the DA's office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution had to be taken when it was time to write what all the restaurants in the city knew was a place for drug traffickers and public authorities.
The reporter learned from the public documents that the restaurant was registered as a politician belonging to the IRP, which dominated all levels of politics throughout the last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in cases of widespread reflection.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about the previous incidents in the same place, including how El Chapo's son, Guzman, was named after him.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched the Valdez column to get information about kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have already known what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose sticky bodybuilding has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all the channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for tags and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, and the staff of the editorship has become something they never expected for the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of tags and went to the local prosecutor’s office the next morning for a further press release.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
The body's been found on fire, and officials say it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal and criticise the phrase "SOS press" as an organised protest against pedestrians and buildings.
On this day, President Bojorquez will be in Washington, trying to raise international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death, when he met the Governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked to be diverted from the government's coverage of its activities, worrying that his anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are "limited" by organised crime, co-indicate public officials and indifferent society.
In his last book "Drug Journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by the orders of politicians and security forces who are in the middle of organized crime.
Last year, more than half of the journalists' attacks on police and civil servants were attributed by the Media Channel Monitoring Group Articulo 19.
"You're gonna die in Mexico because they want to keep you quiet," said Ramirez.
Murders obviously have a blood-staining effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in Tamaulipass, northern border state six years ago.
His body was found with a letter probably signed by a cartel in Los Zeta, "I'm here for my reports."
The computer keyboard and the earphones were lying next to his cut head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after their correspondent, Miroslava Breach, was killed in March.
Others continue to do what the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did for their leader's murder in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Cudad Juarez spoke with a public front cover guide to drug cartels entitled "What do you want from us?".
Some journalists have left their home state or even their country.
It's a case of nervous cancer.
It's hard to find a job in Exile, and they still have to hide out the streets in order to avoid danger.
And sometimes they're being pursued, as probably happened to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in 2015 in a Mexican apartment three months after he was deported.
Those who stay still and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that reflecting on the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico's on his way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
On a recent Friday night, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodoce’s editors sat in front of the office on the sidewalk and drank beer when all of a sudden everyone’s phones started vibrating.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people had died in the fires between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as many of the cartels found in the area promised.
From the same side of the walkway, reporters put news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
The next day's forearm needed a change.
The sirens swung down another fire in the area.
Bojorquez was staring at the police on the watch to see if they were on the watch.
Even if they were afraid, they didn't show it at all.
Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, on which his average finger is visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's employees were carrying him in his footsteps.
"How can I even think about closing," said Bojorquez, "if the same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him to the streets to report?"
Dinosaurus used protective paint to prevent enemies
At first glance, it seems like a statue, though rather frightening.
Scientists have now revealed the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros size found by the Canadian miner, which have been so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that its skin covered with scales was reddish-brown and its past had been somewhat "complicated".
The report published in Current Biology described being as "the best preserved armoured dinosaur that has ever been found" and "one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
Fossil is a new species of nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of a critical era 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation of open scientists who describe it as "truely significant".
This armored vegetarian is according to the National Geographic magazine, the best preserved of this type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in North Albert, Canada.
He hit something that did not resemble the surrounding stone and decided to study closely.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, the animal was designed to be dug out of a piece of land of 2 500 pounds (1100 kg).
After all this hard work, the outcome is now finally ready to be presented to the public.
"If you have a bit of eyes, you can almost believe he's sleeping," said the leading author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes into scientific history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
As he studied his skin, scientists found that this vegetarian, although covered with scales and resembled walking tanks, was likely significantly threatened by meat - fed dinosaurs.
This rich scale dinosaur used red and white to hide from predators, and applied a cloaking technique called counter-stamping, which is also used by many modern - day animals.
According to experts, this allowed the dinosaur to blend better in and avoid enemies, since the larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him.
This 110-million-year-old Nodosaurus family has reached the news for the first time in May and is now visiting the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory at the Borealopella Markmitchell Museum, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to expose the animal.
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of the individual, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the scales on the animal's body.
They discovered a method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top half of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although the resistance has spread, the findings come as a surprise, since Boreaope is far greater than the animals living with the resistance today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was sufficiently actively hunted by other carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution preferred protection instead of opposition as a survival act.
However, most of the animals using modern anti-circumvention - e.g. deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable as a prey, suggesting that the nodosaurus had to work really hard to survive.
"The strong hunting of the hugely large and rich scale-coated dinosaur shows how dangerous it may have been for the critical dinosaurs to be," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the scales also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal to get clues on its life, including the preserved contents of its intestine, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river in death, thereby reaching the current sea, where he sank in front of the ocean floor.
At that time Alberta was as warm as currently in South Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to extend much further inland than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved armory skin, while it remains three-dimensional, preserving the animal's original shape," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal looks almost the same today as in the Crete era.
You don't have to use a lot of imagination to rebuild it - it's enough just to scream at your eyes and it feels like she's asleep."
The Crying Age was a time when the huge two - footed meat - eating dinosaurs were roving around the earth.
Although all of their king Tyrannosaurus Rex lived millions of years later than Borealopella, some of his fearsome predecessors could hunt down this armored dinosaur.
These include the Acracanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 metres) long and six tons.
Researchers recently published in Current Biology believe that Borealopella was washed into the sea after death and that mummification mud.
The creature was discovered on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined a Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in North Albert, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and it is a complete conical to the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five metres) long and weighed up to £3,000 (1300 kg).
Two 20 - inch - long squirrels broke out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this armoured vegetarian traveled through the present Western Canada until the flooded river washed into its open sea.
However, the sea burial site of the dinosaur helped to maintain its scales in excellent detail.
The stoned remains of this particular specimen have been preserved so well that the remains of the skin continue to be covered by the musketeers along the dinosaur skulls.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic : "This degree of preservation is as rare as the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
Stoned skin remains continue to cover the mythical scales on the skull of the animal.
The right front foot lies next to him and five toes are stretched upwards.
I can count the scales on his stable."
How did one of the activists find the answer to the question "Who's Street?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was completely shocked.
Just the day after the trip to New York, it sat on the bed with Airbnb, a resident of St. Louis, on the phone on Facebook.
He ended up in the post of his former schoolmate.
It said, "Policei just killed an 18-year-old kid, and he's still on the street."
He was confused why no one else had posted this information in his stream, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The extension of @TheePharoah user posts was repeatedly shared in his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis area broadcast a real-time broadcast on Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white cop in Missouri, Ferguson.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He hung up on his phone, but later this evening he saw a reschedule that reported a crowd on Canfield Drive this time.
Photos were shared of the police tape and the screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept the tag "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched real-time currents where a cop stood with a barking dog in front of a group of protesters.
In the second video, another cop said, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
Ferrelli remembers how he caught himself thinking, "It's unusual."
"It's not the kind of murder we're used to and what we could call typical."
I felt a lot of fear at the moment.
I was angry and cried."
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., he went to his father to pick up his six - year - old daughter and decided that the next morning they were going alone, Ferguson.
What happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson in the next three years is the central theme of the new documentary "Whose Street?", which will be premiered in cinemas on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and hardship from the perspective of those who live in this community and who fulfilled the answers in demanding streets.
When Ferrell and his daughter, wearing a flower dress and headed for Ferguson, spoke again about the black experience and living conditions that they had had repeatedly discussed before this morning.
"Do you remember when I taught you how a black community was supposed to fight for its rights?" she reminds herself to ask.
"We're driving to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't take him with me," Ferrell said later.
"What's happening right now is... the culmination of what's happened in the past.
He needs to know and see and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activistism and the organisation and at the same time feel the different layers of black experience and living conditions and what we must do to be free and free.
Even if I succeed in raising her so that she doesn't experience a person of insolent racism, she's not different from another black girl.
I feel like I'd be making him a bear if I were to protect him from this world."
The first stop they made when they arrived at Ferguson was on South Florissant's way - from the police station across the road, which had become a camp site of a certain nature, where activists were waiting for news of police officer Darren Wilson, who was finally not charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with the local business owner who prepared lunch meals.
They put together food bags and helped to distribute them to protesters.
For Ferrelli, a new type of activity slowly began to take shape.
"My activityism changed completely after 9 August," he said, pointing out that when she was a student at the University of Louis, she was president of the Association of Lesser Nursing Students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organisational experience.
It all worked out."
Weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell met a co-director of the film Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and the film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was going on.
Ferrelli thought, "Are you trying to document what's going on or find a story that can be used?"
Such scepticism was due to an innumerable number of cases where people - often white - come into the community and try to profit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We have heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson will not be heard and we wanted to do so differently."
Folayan had already struck hands with co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the region who was known for his activity in connection with sentenced prisoners.
His involvement made the project fascinating for Ferrelli and six other locals, who were watched by the crew after Brown was shot.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, but we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
"It was important to me how these people are pictured, because so am I."
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrelli's experience - to show that the movement was not a "rescue guide, but a community reunion", as Folayan said - he became the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Street?" is surprisingly documented by the surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw the linen.
"But I realized that this work and the humanization of black people must be accompanied by certain vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrelli's story emphasizes and refocuss the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators who thought of the theme reference #BlackLifesMatter after killing a black teenager, Trayvon Martin, in the social media in 2012 are homosexual.
"The leading role of black homosexual women has been to maintain the movement in general," said Ferrell, "and that is precisely because we have to fight on several fronts constantly.
Black homosexual women must bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed, stating that "black women really keep the movement alive and many of them are black homosexual women".
At the same time, he claims that "this is not about any kind of equal opportunities creation" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the centre of the film because of his identity.
"He was the person who blew up the right energy," he said.
"But it's not a coincidence that he was right on the front line because as a black, homosexual woman, living in these nodules is much at stake.
His energy can be perceived through the screen."
At the same time, news cameras from Ferguson have long disappeared, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The probation penalty imposed on Ferrelli for blocking the road during the demonstration will continue for another 2.5 years.
He describes the social-political atmosphere in the area he calls home, just a "float".
Still, he still attaches great importance to the mantra he has ate in memory since he went to Ferguson’s streets three years ago.
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
7 tips on how to get over the hangover after the Weekend party
Some of the toughest male boys will find it helpful after a close party.
Or they're going to say "outward hangover, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable delay and a good health problem.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning and get over the hangover as painless as possible after today and tomorrow’s Weekly Trall or other party?
Drink water.
Alcohol down and after, after a big party in the morning... or, if possible, instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid when drinking alcohol, it must somehow be recovered.
Minerals are also washed out of the body along with water, and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often upset after drinking, it is especially good when it is bubble-free or just slightly agitated.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure you wouldn't have to go to Grandma's with a hangover to break the trees. It could be a fatal mistake.
But an easy walk helps the body to remember what it feels like to be alive again.
Lying in a tent and lying out of a hangar is a more time-consuming way of healing.
Give the body back energy slowly and carefully.
If you're about to throw up yesterday's overdose, you certainly shouldn't try to load a big, fat steak.
Start with, for example, fresh juice containing fruit sugars that move your body quietly.
If health is already suffering around lunch, you could try a broth, for example.
And a little later on, on the back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will release your body from the final water.
As I've already said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you are taking a painkiller to prevent a hangover in the evening, your liver must also deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen, in addition to alcohol, and thus lose performance.
That way, you're ruining your liver even more, and in the future, the hangovers will be worse.
In addition, the painkiller does not last much longer in the body.
If you're taking a painkiller in the morning, don't do it on an empty stomach - it'll upset your already dirty stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you'll get along with yourself.
It works about the same way as walking, but when walking, you don't get orgasms.
However, avoid too active aggravating and crazy positivity, physical effort should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding me.
Talk stupid to your friends and associates, do simple stupid things, and laugh friendlyly about yourself and others (suffering).
A joke and a laugh may not make a hangover, but I'm sure it's more fun to put up with the consequences.
Once in a while, I'm gonna go over the top anyway!
Professor Northwestern and employee of Oxford University are wanted for murder as suspects.
According to the police, a nationwide search is being made for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who has become a suspect after finding a dead body of men with deadly stab wounds in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
According to Cook County's court documents, on Monday, warrants were issued for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren, accused of first-degree murder because of their alleged connection to the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the records, the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabilization.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
The police got a phone call and found a victim with multiple puncture holes on his body when he arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment building.
According to the officials, the Cornell-Duranleau scene was declared dead and investigators consider stabs as murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Since 2007, Lathem has worked as a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwestern.
In his e-mail statement, Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of the University of Public Relations, said that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from office and is prohibited from entering the cities of Northwestern University.
"It is now a criminal matter under investigation by the competent authorities, and the University of Northwestern is working with the investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior massist in the financial department of Oxford University.
A representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist the U.S. investigating authorities in any way possible."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give himself up.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the Chicago Police Department's communications department, urges suspects to turn themselves in to the authorities.
"Police has a clue where they're staying, but we're working on defining the exact location more and more intensively," said Guglimelmi.
According to Guglimel, suspects are helped by local, regional and national authorities.
Guglimelmi said that the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building who had just received a cryptic hint that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to the police, it was a magical sight.
According to Guglimel, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's presence in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," added Guglimelmi.
The Grand Plaza Management sent a letter to the residents: "Police is currently working on the chronology of events and the background of the victim, and is investigating various motives, including the possibility that it was a family conflict."
Start-up companies that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees in her e-commerce start-up company, but the polls were useless.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some workers did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs the e-commerce company Madison Reed, which sells 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called for help from outside persons.
New types of human resources start-ups are becoming more important, helping companies to find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software that is designed to measure the involvement of workers, they allow companies to conduct sudden interviews, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hot line of complaints and, in some cases, allow language carriers to pass C-level managers and contact the board directly.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, the co-founder and CEO of Redwood City's start-up company, Glint, whose software analysis tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
According to Errett, he has received much better insight into what his employees think and feel during the three years he has used Glint.
In addition to sudden surveys and specific teams, it offers a company's thermal map, which provides an overview of the most complaints in which departments and the lowest support for which leaders are involved, enabling them to identify the reasons.
Businesses have come to realize that they must keep up to date with their work culture to avoid becoming the next Uber that has been wrapped up in scandals since the former employee published a blog post describing a distressing environment where those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
The global field of governance, regulation and compliance can be worth more than $181.7 billion by 2020 according to the data from the Financial Technology Statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
A start-up company in Denver Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, observed interest and increased activity in the background of Uber's suspicious reputation this year.
Convertcent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glintki, Convertcent allows companies to send customized impulse surveys, collect real-time confidential answers and view thermal maps from problematic areas.
It also provides an anonymous message line allowing workers to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when the CEO is involved, the complaints go straight to the board.
"The public opinion has been seized by the regulatory authorities," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of the Convercent.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees badly or to be immoral, it may face serious consequences, such as boycotts from consumers, workers' departures and cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25 000 employees in 500 establishments, has used Konvercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and operations and to provide an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the company’s headquarters’s phone number or email address, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a distressing and uncomfortable process, said General Adviser James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no good way to monitor workers' complaints.
However, now that the company is using Convercent, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices, which have not previously reached the leaders who were active in offices in other cities or states, can be identified and dealt with more quickly.
"I can get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of employees," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, i.e. after the fall of audit firm Arthur Andersen in connection with the Enron scandal.
But only when "social media has matured", the companies realized that they can't stop their black laundry from being washed on the web in public.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
In February, the Convercent was financed by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the value of the capital raised to 47 million dollars.
In November, Glinti invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company’s total budget to $60 million.
Such investments will not come as a surprise given the relationship between companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the stakes on the table.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy in the company, they feel that they are being listened to and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, who is Vice-President LinkedIn of the Labour Experience Department, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third party analytical tools allow employees to increase their commitment and involvement, it is no wonder that they find support.
Data on employee involvement are, according to experts in the work culture, important.
But these data are useless if the company's supervisors don't do anything with them.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can be expected that changes will be expected.
And if changes do not take place quickly enough or not at all, this can lead to disappointment and a reduction in employee involvement.
"If you ask 4000 proposals, you must be ready for 4000 conversations," said Kotter International President Russell Raath, the consulting and business management company, who has seen how companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
'Cause if things don't end, the workers think, 'Did you actually hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly surveys among workers, has been able to take measures on the same day as the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from workers disappointed in the speed of decision making and quality of communication, he was able to restructure several teams in the company and provide communication training to address the problems.
However, Ruby Tuesdays collects new data on workers and hopes that in the long term it will lead to a longer-term commitment of workers to the industry, which is known for its high labour turnover.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies."
The bright star of the euro area is the Baltic: income is growing rapidly
Although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes referring to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the central bank, the total economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations since 1999.
The success is due to low debt, rapidly improving institutions and business and free market-friendly policies.
"Baltic countries, together with Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries with a real GDP per capita close to the EU average", said the central bank.
Although the aim is to ensure that total economic output per capita is equal to the richest Western Europe, in 2015, the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was only 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries belonging to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle.
Low wages have led the Baltics to look for a better salary abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, the local people are not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, it was slightly less than half of those surveyed on the economies of their countries.
The NSAA's decision to cancel twice a day's training will make Bruins' days long.
It's almost 23, when the UCLA football team stops to talk at the edge of a new training field in the campus of the team.
Some of them have peeled off their shirts, exposing their sweaty backs from the first day of the training camp.
For a large part of the team, these power supplies offer a midday break.
The players participating in the summer courses will return after three hours of training to study for the final exams in the dorm before returning to the Wasserman Football Centre at 6.30 p.m. the following morning.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," said Bruins Coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NSAA's decision to cancel the exercise twice a day to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer - at least until they get on Friday with the final exams.
For this reason, UCLA had scheduled the first three trainings to start at 19.15 to match the players’ already tight schedule.
The transition from two trainings per day means more than one exercise per day - the start of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season, and for the first time in the six Westwood seasons in Mora, during summer courses.
They will have 18 training sessions until 20 August before formal preparation for the opening game in September against Texas A&M.
According to Mora, he is in favour of a change in the NSAA rules, although it adds another item to the players' tight schedules.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they will break themselves through this trial; they will exert themselves, they will be fine young.
I believe that when Saturday arrives and we have more time, it will be really nice."
Once the camp is completed, UCLA’s training will be closed, which is not an easy task, given a clear view of the parking lot and the adjacent Luskin centre, of a higher-class hotel already hit by football that has passed the gate-post network.
Since this weekend, Bruins’ players have been occupying the hotel, but Mora admitted that problems may arise with free rooms during the season.
"Implement security measures," said Mora.
"This is a real concern and it is not exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film training from there.
If you have a record of your training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we'll use a security team at the 8th parking lot.
We'll do our best to make use of what we have.
I'm trying not to worry about it.
We have a plan in place."
The Savisaare-Ivanova Electoral Union, Kristiina Ojuland, who was expelled from the Reform Party, was born to the Centre Party for revenge, and Our Tallinn-Parties were forced to join Maria Kaljuste's forces to show at least as much as the political parties are participating in the local elections this year.
However, chicks will be considered in the autumn, and the key question will be whether they all have enough disappointed voters.
Who's staying with Savisaari?
If Edgar Savisaari's support group has been reduced to a small extent, he may be aware of the events organised in honor of his electoral union.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and present central parties and many unknown faces - is this going to be the composition of the electoral union?
And is there a reason why some loyal followers and friends of the Savisaari avoid running in Tallinn to find out that the “Savisaari List” of kidnappers, led by corruptants and suspected of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
The music video filmed on the roof of the city government for a Russian-speaking pop song with the senior in Lasnamäe City district; and in all respects, the primitive computer game in which the main character, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, has to avoid runoffs and squirrels - is this the first time the Central Party has tried the votes of the 16- and 17-year-old voters to be admitted to the electoral boxes?
We look forward to the idea of a youth-like election campaign for other parties.
If a channel 2 or TV3 viewer is looking at a black square instead of entertainment shows from the beginning of August, there are two options: to accept that in the future, only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English 24 channels will be seen in free circulation, or to hand over tens to some TV operators each month.
There are probably also those who, at first, enjoy advertising-free television experience publicly, but in the end, they pay for television and advertising, though reluctantly.
The ostentatious music, the loud crowd and the garbage left on the streets are the unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don't want to be a part of the noise yourself, you should go home instead of getting a headache, and leave your place to the festival guests for the amount of a little sleep.
Washington changes the rules of the green card
Media publications quote President Donald Trump, who says that a new U.S. immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction of the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The bill goes to Congress in two chambers.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars for taxpayers' money, as it changes the way in which the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and will replace the current programme.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that benefit our economy," Trump said in the United States media publications.
The children of the Siberian Seto move into the city, the pensioners return to the country.
Evseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous set of gold miners along the ancient Maina River.
He works as a driver in a gold fork near the additional river Kuwait, 140 kilometers from home.
It's hard work: two months in a row without rest days, 12 hours of work and then only ten days at home and back again.
During the three years worked at the Artellis, Anatol has only seen gold once.
"It's a tough time: when you go in there, you'll be thoroughly checked not to bring the vodka, and when you go out so you don't bring the gold," Anatoli says.
Mare Piho is talking to a local Seto Jaan in the village of Haida, who has told her a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The scarctic culture of the Siberian sete will also affect home-setos, because it is simply so amazing, thinks the most profoundly distant setes examined by Piho Mare.
It's been 30 years since his first study trip to Siberia.
During that time, he's been there 14 times and lived there for one year.
How much trouble did it take to leave for Siberia at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries to land here?
That's an unsolved question.
I say 8,000.
I've calculated it from the reports of the Siberian Seto men who've been thinking about it.
It's hard to say, because at the time, up to 30 people could come in one group, but the passport was only given to the man.
Pass was given only one, but with him were children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look how big this territory was here!
It was several times larger than the historical Setomaa.
It had to be educated, managed in some way.
The Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (rearing), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Petersburg many setos later went to work in the classified city of Krasnojarsk-45 (where the Soviet power built the uranium debauchery plant - J.P.) when it was formed.
Did the Setos make up a majority of the population in this region at that time?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, a long tradition of marriage and multiple childhood survived.
Seven or eight children in the family were normal.
How much culture of Siberian Setos was different and different from that of the Motherland Setos?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of folk clothes.
They did so themselves (the peoples), but they always made a distinction between what had been brought and what had been done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional outfits of Setos, because it's colder here.
Food changed.
In Setomaa, for example, the meat was salted, but it was just frozen here.
Where are the villages of the Siberian Setots and what lives live there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The link with the motherland was spiritually strong, which was considered to be very important.
Now it seems to me that Setumaa is going to give it back there, and it's going to affect them.
Those girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho means the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to visit Haiti at the beginning of July for Seto’s day and lived for four days at home - J.P.
What's left here is amazing.
"It is extremely easy to come and go because the city has a great location: at the railway hub and at the intersection of the roads," says the operaist Reigo Tamm from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have lots of nature, sports and cultural sites, and pizza can be found in every corner.
Kill is the tip-top city!
There are small islands along the White River that run through the city where the killers usually have a Christmas party.
"This beautiful place doesn't look like a train window", Reigo is muttering.
Whoever is not afraid of cold water can swim in the river, for the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, you can do it!
You can have a picnic and just make romance on the river's side - you can look at the flow of the river and think about life in front and back.
I've been there with my girlfriends for a walk.
The operaisolic Tamm has also visited the riverside between the three bridges to practice his aria: "That this place is on the edge of the city, perhaps no one will resist when their stories come up."
"There is a wonderful view of Tapa, but there are also health lines where you can run, ski winters, and now play discgolf, for example - the golf course is made, disks can be rented from the sports center," directed by Reigo.
I mean, old professionals go there with their disks, of course, but I haven't been able to play there yet.
It is probably necessary to invite my colleague Rasmus Kull to visit Tapa because he is an experienced discgolf player and has disks.
I think he's gonna lend it to me!
Reigo and Männikmäki were inseparable during the childhood of the current opera soloist.
At least during ski lessons.
This mountain has a lot of tears, disappointments, and you can win in my sports life.
Not to mention broken sleds and skis.
"All the city centre is now full of construction works, all this is changing to unknown," says Reigo.
Kill the old and tired building, however, is a very attractive place to play summer games.
I'm glad that in 2012, the director of R.A.A.A.M. Märt Meos accepted my idea and came to the theater to make a summer theater.
Although this year's theatre season with "Alexei Karenin" has just ended, on August 11, there will be a "Living of Life" at the railway station, when the old building is moving around in the 1980s.
"Until 11-13 August, the days of the city of Tapa have woken up after the open cafés of the building and a series of cultural events, including the folk rally," says Reigo, who recommends to visit the city from 91 years of age.
In a small yellow cabin on the 1st of May, the museum has since 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are very large and the information is enormous," says Reigo, a place filled with the history of the City of Tapa, most of which focuses on railways and military activities.
Reigo reminds me that if you go through all the recommended places in Kill, your stomach will be empty in no time, but luckily, a small town will be full of cafes.
"We have such good places to eat, and sitting in cafes sometimes makes you feel like you're abroad," he describes.
The educated and young soldiers who have come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so it is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your home town, but there is such an international community together.
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to stories from the French or Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we have a lot of moves!
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
On TV, bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
On the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of illegal prisoners on the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but we're investigating.
The Foreign Ministry told TV channel BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing severe fines on all those who are caught in resting places that are not intended to do so.
The checks shall continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose fines.
The wolves who teach puppies come to break the sheep.
After a year's break, the Hiiumaa farmers have to give the wolves their herd of "learning material" again - probably the wolves who taught the puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year the wolves in the Hiiu county have broken the sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year was only three, 124 a year earlier.
There are also data from the Environment Agency that last year's Hiiumaa were not born and the Hiiumaa and the Hiiumaa Evaluation Council's information that two wolf litters have been fixed on the island this year.
On Monday night, the wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in the village of Emmaste and injured 18 survivors of sheep.
On Wednesday morning the wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of the village of Reheselja and severely injured another, who had to be killed.
Rules for the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOVS) and on the amendment of the plant protection law to the coordination circle.
The amendment of the Act will waive the creation of a separate database for both genetically modified (GM) crops and operators, and will continue to use the Plant Health Register.
In addition, GM's obligation to have a prior agreement with a person engaged in beekeeping within the prescribed range is amended.
Although there are currently no genetically modified crops in Estonia, we consider that there are clear rules for the co-existence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least until it has been decided to declare Estonia free of GMOs," said Sigmar Suu, head of the Plant Health Department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"It must also be taken into account that the measures developed must be objectively and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors", added Suu.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the GMOVS database of GM crops and the training of operators, lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and for the start of economic activities.
In particular, as regards beekeeping, the current obligation for GM crop growers to notify beekeepers of the start of GM crop cultivation is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with bee-keeper before the start of cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult the draft information system and to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs, if they so wish.
The proposed changes will affect in particular those active in the field of crop cultivation, beekeepers and the Agriculture Agency.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize MON 810.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in the cultivation of GM crops.
The reason is that there is no maize pest in Estonia, a European stemlet, against which maize line MON 810 is resistant.
The varieties of this maize line have also been developed for the southern regions, and this may not be suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies to detect pollution with possible GM organisms in seeds of various suviraps, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain any foreign genes and the study concluded that the seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that there is no conscious cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia and that there has also been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Matic in the form of "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has recruited Nemanja Matic as a "genius" after the central player against Sampdor on Wednesday night.
A player bought over 40 million pounds from Chelsea started the final preseason game of the United in Dublin before Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid in the first two-to-one premiere, with an impression of the role of defence, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on assaults.
However, after remaining out of the Blues preseason Asian tour, Maticul remained in need of a weak form of match, and he lasted only 45 minutes.Mourinho said that this must be repaired before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he has a football mood," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him get the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romele Lukak began the first row at the Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho slowly began to set up his eleven starting men at the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho would still like to recruit three football players, but he confirmed that the club has already done a "great job" by concluding agreements with three of his four priority options.
"I'm grateful to the club for being able to realize three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another son-in-law got a GSM transmitter on his foot on August 1st and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird observer living in the Cinderella, the first cuneiform in Sõrve, with an escort, has already flown around, has left the nest and joined a large overnight collection of Mullutu-Suurlahe.
This is because the Cinderella is not a field of grain, says the Voice of the Islands.
On this Tuesday, to ring the cucumbers relatively late, another cub son and this one on the island of Muhu received the transmitter.
Martinson said that the installation of transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a cub named Mati GSM transmitter was equipped in the Sõrves Tõrgu.
"His actions are on the Internet everyone is watching: how he went to Spain to winter, when he returned for a long time to the German-Polish border, and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
The British inventor had a microchip installed in his body to get into the house and car with his handband.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could just open his front door with a sign, get into the office and even start the car.
33-year-old Steven Northam had a small chip installed between his thumb and index finger and now offers this service through his company BioTeq also to companies and private individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has combined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthesiologist at Hampshire County Hospital in Hants, Winchester, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam’s company also replaces the locks of houses and cars to match the chip, asking for 300 pounds for one lock.
This married father of one child has now installed technology both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which will start when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exhibit went to taxpayers to pay thousands of dollars.
According to the military records published by TIME magazine, the White House’s decision to fly a Navy helicopter last month for an American production event cost the South yard taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The green and white colour Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One during the President's on-board, was the central attraction number of the event introducing American construction programmes in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House renewed industrial products from all 50 states on their tour.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with yachts from Maine, fire truck from Wisconsin and forklifts manufactured in Mississippi.
According to the documents of the Escade Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) responsible for the operation of the helicopter, the White House's warroom required a part-command to the helicopter's presence, i.e. FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern courtyard for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this, because this is an unusually high-profile event," said Commander HMX-1 the day before the event in an e-mail to his superior, Deputy Navy Chief Officer in the field of aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the south yard at approximately 15.00 p.m. on the morning of July 17th until the yard would be cleaned between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the same evening.
The addition was that, if leaving the White House were to be present, a second epipage would be needed for the return flight due to the limitations on working time.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, and the squadron security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to determine from the documents given to TIME magazine whether or not a second Epipae was finally needed.
The Hatchi Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 was investigating whether this event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it was a violation of Hatch's law, and we were told it wasn't a violation," wrote the commander.
"It seems you don't have a choice," answered the deputy chief officer.
The White House declared the event "made in America" an official event, and Hatch's law wouldn't have covered it.
But even official events have political alantons.
The president supported the efforts of the health reform that had taken place in the Senate at the time and endorsed the efforts to keep government regulations under control.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for a politically profitable purpose is not a new phenomenon.
They must be used by the presidents to travel.
However, the requirement to use them as a pure photo session is unusual.
Trump came to his attention in February when his first campaign event in Florida, Melbourne, caught the background of the president's plane, and his Twitter account is full of messages that complain about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the exhibition "made in America", which represented products from all 50 states manufactured by American workers from American materials," said Lindsay Walters, the White House press officer.
HMX-1 teams often fly around Washington and in the south yard to practice landing at the U.S. President's White House with a centimetre accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 organised 58 landings in the White House yard.
According to the official, the flight was counted as a standard for the flight of the flight crew prepared in America that month.
The escort helicopters flew on that day for another 11 hours for non-presidental support missions.
According to the White House, none of the other exhibitors of this event loaded into the taxpayer's wallet.
According to the representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in the organisation of the exhibition in the southern courtyard.
HMX-1 does not maintain the President's budget documents and the exact costs of the event are difficult to identify.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence’s hourly prices for the financial year 2017, the VH-3D compensation rate is 24 380 dollars per hour.
The squadron's records indicated the length of the flight from its base to the Navy's Quantico airport in both directions of Virginia for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is well below its amount.
"The calculation of the cost of paying agents on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading," said Walters.
"These estimated compensation rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irreparable costs, which shall be taken into account for the annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RJ survey, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include personnel costs, but they cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Sean Spicer, former White House pressman, defended the use of a helicopter at the event.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," says Spicer.
"And I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are supposed to be hundreds, if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe, just like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it's right to highlight it."
It's not clear if Trump was in contact with a helicopter during a tour in the south yard, but he was sitting behind the wheel of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump turned to Sikorsky's representatives, making fun of the media about the company's products in his personal aircraft park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of their products."
Grit Shadeiko - through tears came peace and joy
In 2011, Dágus hit Shadeiko in the last area, 800 m of foot ramps ran, and the maid was removed from the stadium with a carrier frame.
Shortly before that, he had received zero in the distance jump of the universe held in China.
In 2012, the EM in Helsinki was damaged by a cheap drop, but at the debut Olympics held in London, he received a 23rd place with 6013 points.
However, misfortune continued.
After the opening day of 2013, Moscow MM received a Estonian record in the distance jump of the Estonian woman.
Two years later, he received 15th place in Beijing’s MM and fulfilled the Olympic standard, but it was also a disappointment to the athlete who wanted more.
The toughest catapult passed only last year, when the Amsterdam EM was unable to get a result in a distance jump.
I'd just like to put together a single multi-round.
Once," confessed Shadeiko.
Even worse, a month later his Olympics in Rio broke the first block due to a thigh injury.
Time had to be taken down - do you want to go on with the seven races?
Is two days of effort worth all this?
She thought for a long time, but she found peace.
I got my head clean.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I've been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and think clean.
"I knew I wouldn't put the pills in the bag yet," says Shadeiko about his self-cleaning.
I was able to turn a clean sheet and move on with a new pace.
According to Coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the sufferings of the dependent, but she realized that the athlete himself must first and foremost come to terms with it.
He was so cut off by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said he wouldn't give up and he wants to prove what he's worth," says Mägi.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He'll do it for himself.
The competition came back in May when Shadeiko set the new Estonian record 6280 points at the Götzis multi-race.
At the high-level competition, he improved his personal top brand with nearly a meter (13.89) and ran a record-time barrier.
Then the multi-challenger felt that it was not a ceiling of abilities, but that it was only a first-time starve.
He has been instructed by Mägi, who says that Shadeiko is a pattern student.
He's a ready athlete. He's good to train.
If something's wrong or wrong, he'll say it right away.
He knows his own body and trusts his own feeling.
That's what we have to do.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and we'll follow it.
A new approach has also been found by Shadeiko.
"I'm not the one who's doing the best in practice," he says, and says that the most important thing is getting the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
Close - up baby luck makes you happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Shadeiko by loved ones.
Both his former training partner, Maris Mägi and his sister Grete, recently became parents, and the multisporter has received support from new weather citizens.
"It's been interesting," says Shadeiko.
One alcohol, the drinking of which is equal to brain training.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big fan of wine that he believes that wine can train the brain better than anything else in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
In his words, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the "very active" wine taste process.
By smelling a glass, spinning wine in the mouth, enjoying it, and perceiving the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to make wine taste.
Sheperd says that wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but taste is derived from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He's bringing a comparison of how the brain "sees" colors.
"The taste is not in the wine, the taste creates the taste of the wine," says Sheperd.
Things that still affect wine’s taste are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva that man produces.
Sheperd, of course, urges that wine is not to be drunk.
"There's got to be more to it," he says.
If you take too much sip, the system will be overfilled.
Excessive drinking of wine can harm the brain instead of the benefit - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine are at risk with memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity.
10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive fewer wages from their colleagues
Data from the Personal Search Company Fontes reveal that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less wages from their colleagues.
The ten percent pay gap is between men and women, writes the portal Genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the wage survey of the Fontes ICT sector.
In total, there were under 8 577 posts.
63% of the posts were employed by men.
"Although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and the rest of the companies believe that there is no pay difference, in reality the basic salary of the men's month is on average 10% higher than that of women and the total salary of the men's year is on average 8% higher than that of women," said Fontese analyst Ilmar Nõhjala.
The third-season commercial clip of Narcose: Now that Pablo Escobar is gone, the Cali cartel will take its place in the Netflix hit series.
Despite the fact that Pablo Escobar's killer was exposed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first one has already had a commercial clip that is teasing a series of new bad guys.
In the third season, the DEA will pay attention to the world's richest drug-trafficking organization, the Cali cartel.
They operate under the direction of four powerful godfathers, like Fortune 500 companies, with just more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is conducting connections with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is active in New York.
The recently released advertising clip shows Pedro Pascal returning to Javier Penana as a character recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will be opening on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the UN Afghanistan mission said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
The head of the UN Assistance Mission, Nicholas Haysom, said that hundreds of women stand for the local council elections, three women stand for the Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The importance of the role of women cannot be exaggerated," he said in a statement made on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The local Councils of Afghanistan and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has for its part threatened the electoral process, which coincides with the transition period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections will mark the first time that power is peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women in democracy increases the success of Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Commission, 1.2 million women out of 3.6 million registered voters are registered.
The joy of sharing makes everything more intense for both the great and the small.
There's always too little time together, but workouts with kids give a good chance to combine being together, playing a game, closeness and load.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you cruise in the summer, you always have the live gloves with you and you'll never forget with your fine voice: "We'll work out now!"
Start warming up - it's very good to have a regular cock game or sneaking along the coastline.
So who would like to take the shape of a sand cake washed from the waves during the summer?
It's amazing to use children instead of a stick!
Firstly, it is safe and comfortable, the severity is gradually increasing at the same rate as the trainer's force.
The advanced can also poke up with quite large children.
The child trains balance, reads repetitions, and feels the pleasure of the opportunity to bend high and be important.
At the same time, the older children can put themselves in trouble.
The scope of movement is determined by touching the ground and stretching hands.
Keep your fingers straight, please keep the miniature tight.
The child can read replay and feel like a coach.
The plan is a very useful exercise, but for the child it is hopelessly boring.
But it's easy to make things more fun!
Game Plank: Take a long plank column to go through once and for all.
In fact, it's harder than usual, but it's much more fun to do than give a friend a hand in the meantime.
To add a load, you can stay in the plan, on the small back, and also walk around in this position.
For additional difficulty, a tiny child may be seated on his hips, but this exercise offers fun for all children.
While crabs pluck on the sand, triceps, buttocks, and abdominal muscle loads will be as good as they are.
The child descends on his feet so that his body weight is spread equally forward and rearward.
You can hold hands for safety.
Roll your feet and stretch straight up.
The kid can fly, have fun, work out balance, and have difficulty.
A little coach's life is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every time he comes up.
The extra load is due to the stretching of the legs.
Make sure your back stays neutral.
Children themselves have much more fun to do in pairs and clap.
Handicraft and pulse.
Watch the child's safety, knee position, and keep your back neutral.
All children's favorite and great fun!
For a parent while truly effective throughout body workout.

From the Philippines to the heart of the world, or Oldkot,
Bags woven from shoulders are a summer classic, which has become its own hit product in recent years, which one true souvenir has to hang on his hand, and for which merchants, despite its modest origin, have been able to weld an additional hit sign.
A bag of straws is probably one of the things that has existed each time in life, and the possession of which has not caused special emotions.
It just exists, and if it doesn't, there's nothing broken.
Now, however, the shoulder bags are making a real victory move, and the fashion fans have changed their fine design bags for summer months against simple shoulder-bleached bags.
This is not only a beach bag, but it is also just as popular today as a street bag, and more courageous women even walk into the office with it.
However, it is worth first making it clear whether such a summer look is still sitting for the boss or whether the wet and laptop should be pushed to a slightly more formal level.
However, the wealth of space has made straw bags a true love for women in the summer.
For example, when you read foreign fashion blogs, the first thing you can see is that fashion gourmets go on a holiday trip to the local market as the first thing they do, and they get some shoulder bags, which are then devoted to the whole holiday period, and which go with them on the beach, the market, and also with friends on the streets of the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy more bags from the market and sell or hand them over to their loyal readers.
In doing so, it is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so great that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go after each other with their hands to become the happy owner of a few bags.
In some ways, such madness is also understandable, because it is rare that in the fashion world it is possible to buy a few things that have gone into a hit position for just a few hundred euros.
True, clever traders have also found a simple way to make money here, and so the finer luxury brands sell beer bags for a few hundred euros and thousands of euros.
Probably still in order for richer customers not to feel like simple mortals who promote around with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana a shoulder bag that costs more than a thousand euros.
For the interpretation of Chanel’s bag, it is possible to pay EUR 6000.
Unlike most fashioners, the shoulderbags did not come from a few large fashions, but their story began far away.
It is said that the shoulder bags come from far from the Philippines, where they have been carried in the wide air.
It's the express business, especially when you're in the back of a bag, and you don't see the locals running around with them very often.
It is said that the beer-sinking technique dates back to the 14th century, and it's pretty sharp with the ordinary basket-snap.
However, since the shoulder bag does not need to be braided as well as the basket, the patterns and other materials can be embedded in them, making the bag more personal and therefore more attractive.
For example, in recent times, there are particularly trendy bags in which coloured ribbons or leather strips are pressed in.
However, the letters of thanks may be sent to actress Jane Birkin, the biggest of whom had ever been seen.
His name was to fit his shoulder bag with all kinds of clothing kits, and he didn't even think much of it to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
Today, the popularity of bags does not play a smaller role, but the fact that caring for them is a cockhead, and unlike all kinds of other humadans, they need not be cared for by special means, but also by water and wet towels.
As with trendy blasphemies, brands have come out with all kinds of interpretations, apart from classical appearances.
For example, if you wish, you can get yourself a shoulder - woven rib or a tiny shoulder bag.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that a classic shoulder bag never goes out of style, but a shoulder bag does.
But what's a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, a bag of shoulders that resembles a basket of its style has been regarded as classic and has been opened and short, as well as straws, handles.

A missing man was found in Saaremaa three days ago
On Wednesday evening, the treasure left its home in the Avalanche of Kärla, an unknown direction.
The last contact was on the phone yesterday, Friday night, and the positioning of the phone gave the man the location of the village of Lääne-Saare, the village of Mõnnute, where he was searched for by helicopter until midnight and early morning with dogs.
Then his cell phone was empty, and his location could no longer be identified.
The police continued their search this morning.
The police thank everyone who helped find the treasure.
GMB is concerned about investments in the company McVitie's Glasgow factory.
The trade union expects the heads of the cookie manufacturer McVitie's to confirm the long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow factory.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent about the future of the Tollcross object’s investment.
More than 500 people work in a factory that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products.
The company McVitie's owner of Pladis said they've invested more than £5 million in the last few years.
There were more employees and union presidents "are the first to hear" when something changes in the factory's activities.
In a letter to the company's head of object, GMB Scotland asked McVitie to "dissolve concerns about the fact that funding is not used to modernise production lines".
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we do not get a clear view of Tollcross's business needs and future investment plan from the head of the object makes our members deeply concerned.
There have been many generations of families working here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people in the Glasgow neighbourhood, as an essential pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social waste.
Thus, from the point of view of jobs, wages and well-being in eastern Glasgow, and in view of Brexit, the rise in housing costs and the chronic decline in production in McVitie, a company with a strong growth in output."
The representative of Pladis said: "The object manager of the Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company responds directly to it because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting took place between the employees of the Customs Cross and GMB representatives, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
So we discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our activities - and this applies to all our companies and objects - in order to ensure that we are competitive.
He added: "In recent years we have invested more than GBP 5 million in the Tollcross object, most of it has gone into production lines and improvements in operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as an object of production, and if there is any change in the activity of the object, the employees and the representatives of the trade union shall be the first to hear of it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about the approach to Neymar?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up his efforts to lure Neymar into his ranks by making an offer of £ 189 million to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record invasion?
This blatant approach has opened the summer transition window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than double the current world record of overshopping, which was set last season with Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for £89 million.
Once the transition has been completed, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and, at the same time, the most paid professional athlete in the world, who will receive more than GBP 500 000 per week from PSG after payment.
Barcelona is angry about both the approach and Neymar's release, although the source close to Catalans' management confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the football player since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the president of the PSG warn the football world of such an opportunity three years ago?
In 2014, when Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuid, Nasser strongly warned all clubs that were thinking about recruiting some of the best PSG players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we'll come up against them and contact them," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to enter into a contract with one of our players, they will have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line, as the Spanish club previously showed interest in the PSG central player Marco Verratt this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not let the Italians leave on any condition and that Barcelona could get a setback as a result of this interest by losing one of Neymar’s precious assets.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brexit is seriously threatening to hit the cliff between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland", Varadkar warned Northern Ireland on his first visit after his appointment in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the free movement of current people and goods possible, said Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders," he stressed.
According to Mr Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and, as it is not possible, to remain part of the European common market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: 'We could certainly have one with Britain'.
The alternative would be to return to the customs offices, which would declare historical fragmentation and political failure.
"The barrier to trade, prosperity and peace", said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of daily life in Northern Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when visiting Belfast.
Marrt Avand, who passed his first half-long triathlon, is able to pass Ironman.
Today, in the winter capital, Otepää, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltics was held when the semi-long Ironman competition took place in more than 30 countries.
The 70,3 km distance consisted of 1,9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21,1 km of cycling.
Among others, the first triathlon of his life was triumphantly completed by Märt Avand.
"I thought it was going to be complicated and eventually it was difficult," said Avand in the finale.
Despite the complexity, Avand discovered that the triathlon is actually a force for almost everyone.
"Not the distance kills, but the pace kills," he said, suggesting that the speed will reach the finish almost everyone.
Except Ott Sepp: "He's fine with physics, but he can't swim".
Avandi had been busy training since February.
At the beginning of 4-5 hours a week, then later 10 hours a week.
By time 05:34:12 he reached 270th position in the general account.
Although Avandi lost both to Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Lig (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called "prominen class" competitions.
Last year, Tanel Padar, a "good example", lost to Avand in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
The general winner of the Otepää phase men of the Ironman series was crowned German John Moldan with 3:58:27; the best of the Estonians was Ivo Nagy with time 04:14:09.
Among the women the Dane Helle Frederiksen won with time 04:24:01, but of the Estonians Maria Rabbit, who lost to Frederiksen in about half an hour and became 04:58:58.
The avatar passed a distance of 1.9 km in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water at 410.
