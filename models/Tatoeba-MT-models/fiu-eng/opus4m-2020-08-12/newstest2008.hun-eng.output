European inflation has fallen on food
The acceleration of inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The price increase in November was higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, with annual inflation of 3.1 per cent per annum recorded after 2.6 per cent in October - reported by the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union.
The official forecast was only 3 percent likely - reported by Bloomberg.
Unlike the American, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not cut the base currency, saying that the reduction would lead to inflationary spirals, combined with rising raw materials prices and reduced unemployment.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate close to two per cent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is trapped in its twenty-two traps: 'you need to talk down' inflation so that it does not have to act on this subject later.
In Germany, the value of inflation in November is a twelve-year record; in Spain, it rose from 3.6 to 4.1.
Euro-zone inflation was driven high by rising food and energy prices.
The fixed-term wheat notes have increased by 88 percent and the soya price has reached the highest value since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products also had to be paid significantly more in 2007.
The world market price for oil increased by 52 percent this year, and last month it cost almost $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, this year's inflation jumps from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but is already falling to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
According to the analyses, the 12 month inflation level will remain at around 3% in the next 3-4 months, but the annual average rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, it is expected that the ECB will decrease interest rates twice during 2008.
The Gallup sees a government crisis
After a long stagnation, Fidesz's support circle increased significantly by early December, so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has not previously measured such low socialist support of 13 percent.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - because of the greater determination of opposition voters - would mean more than two-thirds (71%) of MSZP's one-fifth (20%) support.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their support within the entire population is two per cent.
Among the votes of the Commissioner, the supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The economic public opinion was even worse than the previous one - it was never so high, 41% of those who considered the country's economic situation to be very bad, while another 46% said it was quite bad.
The changes in their own financial situation are now being judged more pessimistically after the spring and summer hopeful prospects.
For the following year, a larger half of the population is counting further deterioration and only one-tenth of the improvement.
In December, more than any previous survey of Gallup, 71 percent of those surveyed believed that the Prime Minister would do his job badly rather than do his job well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13 percent of those questioned trust or trust very much, while in Viktor Orbán 38 percent of those supported.
The Prime Minister doesn't trust 54 percent at all, 27 percent of the President of Fidesz.
One indicator of the political situation is the extent to which society believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be addressed without a change of government.
While 35 per cent of the government and the Prime Minister thought it desirable after the riots last October, this rate is currently only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) sees only the solution in writing new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterised by the fact that 60% of those questioned answer the question of willingness to participate, that they would certainly leave, and another 20% say that they would probably leave.
As a comparison, only 55 percent would be sure to participate in a 'now-sunday parliamentary election' and another 15 percent would think it would be likely to be taking part, and the result of the referendum would not be questionable according to the intentions of the present.
For tuition, 74 people, 79 people's visit fee and 84%'s hospital daily fee would say no.
If we look at the same proportions only among those who are sure to participate in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89% of voters would lose the introduction of tuition, visitation fees and hospital daily fees.
The most expensive is Auchan, the Tesco raised by nearly a fifth
In the Budaörs trade triangle, hypermarkets kept a price increase of 16 percent on average last year, with the exception that VAT did not increase this year.
Article of the Daily Economy
This year, the daily average Christmas basket increased by an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs trade triangle, but in each hypermarket there was an increase of well over a thousand forints in value.
Since last December the prices in food stores have already been "depreciated", so compared to the previous high base there has been no dramatic price increase.
However, it is obvious to consumers that what they received last year was well below nine thousand forints, not even ten thousand.
The daily basket has crossed the ten thousand HUF psychological limit with at least 91 forints in the tested hypermarket.
And the highest basket value was 10 573 HUF.
(The basket cost HUF 6800 in 2003)
The price of Unicum and live fish remained almost on last year's level, but the price of turkey fillets, nuts and sweets also increased.
KSH's data was followed by the price of flour and bread in the shops, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for HUF 139.
Competition did not print down the price of the product under 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this business that the price of the two-litre interchangeable bottle, Coca-Cola, was below 200 forints, and so, together with the deposit fee, only HUF 257 was requested for the product.
This year, however, Auchan showed himself to be the most expensive in his daily basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
Compared to last year's Christmas prices, Cora 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased the prices in their daily basket by about 18-18 percent.
Compared with last year's most expensive and this year's cheapest basket value, the difference was 12 per cent, while last year's cheapest and most expensive are 21 per cent.
Forint had an average growth of 1480.
Last year the average price increase came to 1206 forints, so that last Christmas it felt the effect of the increase in the prices of VAT.
It is this process that has disrupted trade, and it appears that the stores were unable to decide how much margin to apply to a product, since they were unable to calculate the impact of price changes on consumption.
(If the rate of rotation of a product is wrongly planned by the trader, it may be of serious benefit to the margin adjusted to the traffic intensity.)
VAT was so extreme last year that the price increase in the daily basket was more than HUF 1720, while the price difference was just HUF 844, at the cheapest.
This extreme did not show up this year, as the most expensive one was 1630 HUF more than last year, and the cheapest one was 1284 HUF more expensive.
Compared with the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic increase in prices has been seen, and in less than 20 months daily consumer goods have been over 30 percent expensive in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily justify KSH data: the statistical office has measured an increase of more than 30 % over 12 months for some basic foodstuffs.
For example, in addition to flour, the egg.)
According to the Napi basket, this seems almost inability to the latter, since the price level of the fairly expensive product last year also produced a price increase of just over 10 percent in the worst case compared to the base.
The flour suppliers appear to be in a stronger position than eggers, and the dramatic price increase has also been fooled by the multiplies.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypers don't complain, they keep reporting for a good year.
According to our experience, most of the customers in the three shops they visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy a lot of everything, take long-lasting food on a plate.
On Wednesday morning, in all three shops, there were serious lines before the money prices, as the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, we know that traffic in rural areas is weaker, that there are several complaints to research companies that there is no income, not only for food, but also for durable consumer products.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
More than 1,000 infections have been reported in hospitals this year, mainly due to inadequate use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the crowding of beds, the overburden of staff do not favour stopping infections, states the head of the Department of National Epidemiology Centre.
They save on disinfectants in many places.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of John's Hospital.
After a serious accident, bacteria were found to be resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was isolated.
There was a similar infection at the beginning of the year.
The victim of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but soon afterwards he had to return with MRSA infection, and no major surgery was ever performed because of the bacteria in his system.
This year, the hospital infection caused by 1094 multi-resistant pathogens was reported in the National Nosocomial Survey System, said Böröcz Karolina, head of the Department of National Epidemiology Centre.
This means that infections caused by so many multi-resistant agents have certainly been registered in the hospitals, the others are unknown.
About two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
One third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their noses without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. sore throat, mandula, skin infections, infection) respond well to antibiotics and are well treated.
However, if antibiotics are administered too much or not properly, the bacteria that responds well to antibiotics develop very resistant to antibiotics, which spread rapidly under inappropriate hospital conditions.
In particular, severe hospital infections, such as ulceration or blood poisoning, may occur in patients with poor body, old or low body weights when the immune system is temporarily or permanently poor.
According to the medical director at John's Hospital, MRSA infection has nothing special, such infections belong to the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the movement, MRSA is just not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not tested.
Resistance to antibiotics
"We separate such patients, the nursing staff provides the patient with rubber gloves and masks, and they have the appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients entering the hospital will be examined for the presence of MRSA in their system, but the infection will not always be avoided.
Sampling is not a fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current domestic hospital conditions and conditions are not favourable to prevent the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Böröcz Karolina.
As this infection typically occurs in hospitals, in elderly people, hospitals should check out the patients entering the hospital and separate the patients carrying MRSA immediately.
However, in Hungarian hospitals there is no microbiological sampling in fashion.
The National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these examinations.
Most cases thus arise when the patient is diagnosed with MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiological centre’s department.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are domestic guidelines on the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies should be carried out to avoid developing resistance to drugs, but hospitals do not always follow this.
Microbiological samples are even less frequent in walking or basic care, said Böröcz Karolina.
Save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is the most frequently transmitted patient-to-patient.
Therefore, hand washing, gloves, the use of the mask, has a very important role to play, but there are also significant shortcomings in this in hospitals.
MRSA is spread by dripping, contacting, but it is not always possible to separate the infected patient under domestic hospital conditions.
In fact, the hospitals are often crowded, often very close to each other, although patients should be at least two feet [1.5 m] apart from each other from each other from the epidemiological point of view.
Unfortunately, it is also noticeable that Böröcz Karolina noted that hospitals in a bad financial situation are saving on disinfectants, few nurses, many patients, and so there is an even greater chance of infections.
According to Böröcz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are observed, there are fewer such infections or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The management of MRSA causes enormous expenditure for health insurance and therefore they are fighting it everywhere.
In England, for example, the Government Programme included a reduction in the prevention and incidence of MRSA.
The programme appears to be a successful, reported data indicate a decreasing trend in MRSA infections in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) priorities include the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by such agents.
He wasn't drunk with the police captain who caused the fatal accident.
The official expert opinion on the fatal accident caused by Commissioner XXII has been drawn up.
It can be excluded that drunkly or in a stale state, Commissioner XXII, who had resigned from his post in the meantime, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday, informed Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the General Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday after the expert opinion was drawn up.
The expert opinion supported the primary test result, which has already established that the former Commissioner did not consume alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
At the time, the leader of the XXII. district headquarters hit a 55-year-old man on Tuesday in Kossuth Lajos Street, in his own car, who did not want to cross the roadside at the designated crossroads.
(The latter, therefore, that the pedestrian did not pass through the Zebra, under the rules of the CRS, is not a mitigating circumstance, so the turner should still give priority.)
The pedestrian lost his life after transport to the hospital.
As a result of what happened, the district police chief resigned and asked to be retired, according to the police, because the case was so shaken.
The case is under investigation by the Budapest Investigation Office.
Attila Morvai also asked if the former Commissioner of Police had cooperated with the prosecutors of the investigation from the outset.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Three loan framework agreements in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy worth EUR 400 million were signed by János Veres, Minister of Finance and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) in Budapest on Friday.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund, of which the parties have already concluded a loan agreement of 100 million, the contract now signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
Education-related projects are also to be financed by the 150 million-euro loan agreement.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million will be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million, which is used primarily by the budget for the University of Debrecen's research and development project.
The meeting included subway 4.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, they will return to the question of whether or not the original contract needs to be amended.
According to János Veres, this will take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on loans shall be granted by the EIB with a period of 8 years and no maintenance fee for EURIBOR.
Bulgaria is an EU property paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of the whole of Europe is focused on the Balkan country, which was mentioned a little before.
What, where and who are still buying in the cheapest, but fast-priced market in the EU?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most popular property purchase target in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the mountains are the most beautiful areas of Banszko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and on the beach Albena, the "Arany Beach", the "Napospart", the ancient Sozopol and Neszebár, but more and more people are also looking for property in Kavarna and Balcsik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, the central part of the country will sooner or later also attract investors - Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people will also buy in the specifically cheap Russ area.
The capital, Sofia, also offers attractive opportunities, and commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its best path to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, so that in addition to the summer and winter season, it will be a priority destination in the other two seasons.
For this reason, prospective investors are already buying heavily, such as in the Banszko area.
Analysts say that the buyers of the property in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and their way of life.
Most customers are English, but come from France, Belgium, Spain and more from Romania.
The Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, and the Black Sea and the ski resorts traditionally have many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers can be classified into three categories, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settlers buy or refurbished properties at a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or flattened old houses for 5 to 15 thousand euros, and then refurbished them.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, important to them is a big city, shops and generally the proximity of a local doctor.
The second category is for holiday customers (Bulgaria was added to the list of the first 10 German destinations in December).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who are buying in the hope of medium to long-term value growth.
The cost of capital property is constant, as demand is increasing.
Although the lowest real estate prices in the European Union are in Bulgaria, in the last five years there has been an increase of 21% per year.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially above the increase in payments.
Fodor and six Hungarian percent
According to the Minister for the Environment and Waters, expert meetings will be concluded on Tuesday, and after the formal opening on Wednesday, ministers will continue to negotiate the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Agenda, which provides for efforts following the emission reduction period set out in the Kyoto Protocol by 2012.
This is currently under discussion between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not want to negotiate precise figures at the moment, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another major issue of the conference is whether the developed countries undertake not only to reduce emissions, but also to provide both financial and technological assistance to those in need.
There has been an agreement on aid to developing countries.
The grant fund, which is provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a board of 16 members, expected to be read in the Market and Profit within the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF).
Six per cent of Hungary
Gábor Fodor, Minister for the Environment and Water, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain the role of flagship in global climate protection efforts and to promote the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that by 2020 the EU would undertake to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, regardless of the success of the conclusion of the post-2012 Convention, and is ready to reduce up to 30%, if other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to commit themselves to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that, in 1997, the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol had a total reduction of 5.2%, including the EU - then 15 Member States - committed less than 8%.
The Hungarian commitment is a greenhouse gas emission reduction of 6 percent compared to the period 1985-87, which will be achieved by our country. - reminds us of the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
There is a high stake in Bali, because within two years the long-term international climate agreement needs to be reached, otherwise its entry into force would certainly come into force after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed by a new international emission reduction system, which was also indicated by the latest report of the IPCC, the UN Nobel Peace Prize, on climate change.
This would result in a delay in emission reductions and an inevitable increase in the average temperature of the Earth above 2 degrees Celcius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely severe and irreversible consequences.
The British army is recruiting on YouTube.
Records of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are published on video distribution by British military units, with which they promote themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) received YouTube: Special Branches in Afghanistan have uploaded videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006 - announced the BBC.
These miniature cameras, equipped with a helmet camera, are being checked at the Air Force Cannon Operations Command, and then sent to London, where the domestics upload them to the Internet.
A Political Message Is Necessary
Air force soldiers have already recorded 139 on the Internet in this form, and over 75,000 people have watched their "channels".
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and publishes videos of both Iraqi and Afghan operations, while the British Ministry of National Community (Commonwealth Office) and Iraqi international peacekeeping agencies (GNFI) also have their own YouTube channel.
Mission in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally intended to put on videos for recruitment, and according to the Ministry of Defence, this is also a good thing to make public aware of the real purpose of the military's presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this form is almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitment ads, said BBC defense expert Gordon Mackenzie, but it has an unpredictable political message, as it demonstrates in a specific form the existence of military actions decided by the government.
The Americans were playing a game.
In addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, the army is also troubled by amateur videos that show, for example, the death of soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, officers are talking about losses, but do not present the bloody side of the fight.
By the way, several videos from Iraq and Afghanistan's military scene have already been released on the Internet that were made on sharp missions, but only recently received by the British army.
The Americans recruit a little bit differently, with the free downloadable American's Army shooter game, in which the player can hide directly in soldiers' skin in a more or less lifelike simulation.
There's gonna be a Christmas party at the Ministry.
Minister of Labour Lamperth Mónika does not seem sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, he will hold an annual work meeting for his colleagues, who will be able to give their luggage and coffee from 2007.
There's a ministry where there's a live music party, somewhere else with a storm and a toast, they'll enchant Christmas into the hearts of the officials.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and Swedish table - so you have fun with the power.
The state agencies are preparing for Christmas.
The biggest-class Ministry Christmas party is held this year by the defense wallet, but HM is not waiting for the Ministry employees.
In the Christmas of Oradea, the children of the fallen soldiers receive a gift, and in the Christmas of the Mission, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are welcome to the press.
The wallet is worth 25 million to the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) are fired from the skin compared to the rest of the wallets.
The GKM party is held at the future house, from a total of 4 320 000 HUF, and about three hundred and fifty guests are expected from the six hundred Ministry staff.
At the festival of the wallet, they will stick to the Christmas atmosphere, but there will be performers and a storm.
The NFU’s Christmas cost HUF 4 700 000, and the National Justice Council (OIT) was also held on Wednesday — concerts and dinner.
The rent cost a million forints, the remaining part spent on more than 400 invited persons.
We know that one class of the NFU is also official for another Christmas celebration: it is organised by a tender management company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development, with EU money.
For the purpose, they rented the building of the Veneer Theatre.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt as we failed to reach the competent authority.
I don't need a suit.
The OIT building saw not only the NFI, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held a Luca Day ball on 7 December instead of Christmas.
He didn't ask them for money to use the OIT rooms.
500 people attended the ball.
The party started with the Minister's toast, and it was possible to dance to live music after dinner.
The question [origo] was told: at the ball there was no obligation on the evening dress or suit.
Puritan's health, labour and municipal wallet is organized for a party.
The Ministry of Health organises a show and a ceremony for workers in their own building for HUF 400 000.
However, Minister of Labour Lamperth Mónika is officially waiting for a work meeting at the end of the year, not for a Christmas party.
They expect 100 guests, who - the press department said - will only get coffee and luggage, so they can bring the party out of 350,000 HUF.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of State, will simply have a drink with his colleagues at the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is holding a Christmas meeting in its own hall, with 436 employees waiting for it.
Each guest has 2500 HUF for the Christmas party - the amount includes a Swedish bet and a toast.
Since John Veres is a minister, the employees of the PM have been doing similar Christmas every year.
It will not, however, be a bull's-eye; the officiality will be confirmed not only by the Ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon.
On 20 January, the agricultural wallet will give a New Year's bet, the Ministry's Christmas will be missed.
The bet is held at Vajdahunyadvár, in the City League, and according to the wallet, the 100 guests are intended for a thousand HUF per person.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple standing reception, for which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are official.
These annual bets start with a brief ministerial greeting and end with a restraining snack.
At all, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not hold a Christmas party - has been announced to [origo] in the competent press departments.
The price of the official Christmas of the environmental wallet could not be stated in the press department.
At any rate, more than 400 people were invited to the party at the Museum of Applied Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are coming together.
On Friday, their strike coordination committee will be set up by the League of Trade Unions and the National Association of Labour Councils.
There will be a general assembly in protest on Saturday, and on Monday - the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - will begin with the termination of work.
The action will certainly cause significant disruptions in transport, as rail transport will almost completely stop and will strike at the BKV for 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League of Trade Unions will present details of their attack on Monday, organised jointly with the National Association of Labour Councils.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be set up, which will coordinate the actions on Monday.
There will be a protesting assembly on Saturday, and organisations joining the strike will cease their work indefinitely if they are unable to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act, has not been marked.
If the Parliament does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
However, if they vote for the law, the strike committees will meet and decide on the continuation.
On the basis of the Parliament's Monday agenda, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will only be voted in late evenings, perhaps at night.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, significant disruptions can be expected in the transport sector: the work will be stopped for an indefinite period at the railways, some of the public transport in Budapest may stop in the morning, more than half of the Volan companies.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, there will be a semi-road roadblock.
Several trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the strike call and are constantly updating their list on the month of the League.
Some organizations have signaled a strike for an indefinite period of time, others have declared temporary terminations.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Free Trade Association of MÁV and Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not even agree on sufficient service, although as Christmas holidays are nearing, more and more people travel by rail.
According to previous reports, they strike at BKV from the start of operations to 13 hours, between 7:00 and 9:00 in the morning at Budapest Airport, four hours of strike are being held by the LIGA Electrical and Heat Trade Unions, and the Pedagogues Trade Union and the Democratic Trade Union called for a 2-8 hours suspension.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes nationally at changed times, and the Democratic Trade Union of Workers in the Health and Social Sectors of the SZEF is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The four demands made by the League are the most important to the government to withdraw the proposal for health insurance reform and to give a new concept to social debate.
The second requirement is to introduce gradually the new pension method due next year.
The third is to ensure access to the scheme for working time worth working time before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers of the League Trade Unions (VDSZSZ) does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport for railway lines, and another offer is expected.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard raised the risk of the country
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August of this year with the support of Jobbik for Hungary, raised the political risk of Hungary and the region in a number of respects, according to the Risk Analysis Division.
In the company's "risk warning", it was said that in the context of the Hungarian Guard's activities, the greatest political risk is that "with the already existing ethnic tension between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, even in the short term, violent ethnic clashes can arise".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to aim to provoke such an act, the research institute added.
As it has been written, this is due to one of the main failures of Hungarian political actors: 'public debate on Roma has been passed on to representatives of radical and extreme political groups who could have built a political strategy on the gypsy-Hungarian conflict'.
This will deepen the problem, make normal dialogue impossible, strengthen the extremists and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts - they believe.
In addition, according to the research institute, the Hungarian Guard's activities have been "a significant deterioration in the image of Hungary abroad, particularly in terms of its belief in the stability and democratic development of the country".
It is recalled that from the autumn of 2006, the re-organization of radical and far right-wing groups in Hungary became increasingly visible and encircled, as a part of Hungary's re-organization of several "national defence" associations since the summer of 2007.
"The common feature of these concentrations is that they define themselves as a civil society organisation, while openly declaring their members, whether armed or not, to be prepared for defence (a disaster protection, defence, police, police) and the inability of the state".
It has been noted that this is done in accordance with the method based on the political and parallel nature of society, which seeks to put various political aspirations in civil robes.
The emphasis on civil society and the form of association are therefore not only intended to avoid the legal disadvantages of court registration in these associations, but also to provide a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-raising factor for neighbouring relations.
"In recent months, several neighbouring countries have been referring to the Hungarian Guard as a potential threat, and the ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries are trying to justify their own anti-Hungarian policies by referring to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
This has an impact on the political stability of the region".
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, so political risks have increased for the whole region.
As stated, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, the establishment of which was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union of the Far Right (BNU).
The background to the formation of the Bulgarian Guard is the mass Roma riots that broke out in one quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken advantage of this in its decision on the establishment of the Guard, saying that the aim of the organization is "national self-defense".
For the past 17 years, they believe that there has been a 'Gypsy terror' in Bulgaria, but the state has remained idle and indifferent - reminds Political Capital.
They added that the initiative has led to an intense debate in the Bulgarian public.
As has been said, the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes indicates that certain Roma organisations in Bulgaria have announced that resistance is the creation of their own guerrilla.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard has shown similarities to the operation of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Roma in Hungary will react similarly to the threat by organising their own self-defense – it can be read in the Political Capital’s risk warning.
Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said to the interest of the telecommunications office that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they publish their risk analysis every year, and if they experience something that could affect the change of risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
It's not always a red-word holiday.
In Hungary, the law accurately marks the red - letter days, and around the holidays, the work-day restructuring has become a general practice, which will be fewer by next year.
It is not a single holiday in the EU and in America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and holidays.
The holidays are mostly linked to church holidays and significant historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last and the first days of the new year is a break - the latter is for the New Year's seasoners to rest.
All year long, we've got a total of eleven red stars.
The National Festival is also the Memorial Day of the Revolution of 1956, which will remember the revolution in 1848.
On 20 August, we celebrate the state foundation and on 1 May we celebrate the work, and on 1 and 2 November we remember our relatives and friends who died.
In addition, we have a two-day celebration of Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our public, national or religious holidays are rare for the weekend according to the calendar, the shifting of working days has become a practice in cases where we work only one day before or after the red-word holiday.
True, the price of extended weekends is that we don't stay away from work on previous Saturdays.
The fact that the day immediately before or after the holiday is to be processed exactly when has been covered for many years by a separate regulation by the Minister of Labour.
The legislation covers all employers and their employees, civil servants and civil servants.
It does not, however, affect service companies and institutions operating without interruption and operating on working days for its intended purpose.
This year, only around the end of the year's holidays, the working schedule will be changed: from December 24th, life will almost stop in the country, as according to experience, the days between Christmas and New Year will be "slip" by the majority of people, or will use their saved freedom for this purpose.
Next year, more of our holidays will fall to the middle and end of the week, so there will be less workday relocation than this year.
At first, the calendar changes around the holiday of work, so that workers can stay at home for four days.
It's a Saturday, April 26, to be on Friday, May 2nd.
The second transfer is linked to the 23rd of October: on Saturday 18 October, we will have to work instead of the 24th of Friday.
The end of the year, however, can be a full holiday for the future, as from 24 December they will take a nonstop break almost everywhere, even if New Year's Wednesday falls.
Six scary little things to piss off your colleagues
E-mails, which we forget to send, voice mails that we never get, are innocent lies that we almost no longer notice: they "color" the everyday work.
It's a question of whether you're accustomed to small inconveniences or wearing gloves and consciously avoiding misunderstandingal, vindictive situations for others.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to let you know I was looking for you in marketing," says one of your colleagues.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, he regrets and tries to make it up to you, perhaps calling the marketing class to tell you he forgot to deliver the message (this is the less common solution).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before making an awkward apology, you should consider what it is to get unpleasant moments for your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid it.
You're gonna borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than reaching out for a file, office stuff, or your phone, and it's nowhere.
Remember yesterday you put your stapler on the table, but by morning, he needed his foot?
Maybe you'll discover your lost pen on one of your colleagues' desks?
Without a request, do not take anything from your colleagues, for they will rightly be angry with you to ride their property.
Don't put me in the pocket from the office envelopes, post office stamps, 'cause it's gonna be awkward if you run out of time, and you need it right away.
Are you gossiping about the privacy of colleagues?
There's no way to stop the rumor that's spreading.
Who, who, what did you do?
Where and why?
Do not tie your information (your terms) about the privacy of your colleagues to everyone!
If one of them shares his secrets with you, don't abuse his trust.
Bury what you hear, and do not negotiate with your colleagues in your absence, even if others know about what your colleague is doing.
Are you an unsubstantiated patient?
When you call the office and report to a patient referring to a twitching headache because you have a bad feeling or feel like you would rather rest on that day; think that your work, your immutable work, your time-limits must be done by someone else.
Don't mess with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you're not going to go to the office the next day, or if there's something you need to stay home for, tell them that your colleagues and your boss don't face a shortage the next day.
Snorting, whining, making calls
Did you get involved in the job, but that's what's really pulling you out of the way?
You've become an unwitting ear witness to a phone call that you wouldn't have heard better?
Do not disturb your colleagues with sulking, singing, loud talk (which you continue above their heads) or with footing, continuous swearing, and loud dissatisfaction.
They can all be confusing, even if they do not get involved in a project (writing, design, organisation).
Are you blaming others for mistakes?
If you don't have time, you forgot to send me an important letter, a message, don't blame me for your forgetfulness.
Don't make any reference to the chaos that may prevail in the office, to your loud colleagues.
Admit it if you made a mistake, and it's a disadvantage to someone else, and get rid of the skank.
Ask him how you could make up for your mistake, make up for failure.
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Mack and slippers: comfortable wear for home, but it's not for office!
Don't wear a comfortable free time suit if your job allows.
Don't be smocky, your colleagues, and respect yourself by going to the office with your usual clothes - if your work requires you, pretty and elegant!
If you want to answer, you're not interesting anymore.
Scratching the car in the usual morning traffic.
There's a special tune from the radio, the sound of a violin associated with electronic effects.
I'm gonna roll up the volume.
The music has changed and the bass comes along with the earlier sounds, and then a female choir is connected as a real jewel.
It's Zagar Wings of Love on mr2.
The domestic music life has not spoiled us for a long time with a high-quality electronic pop.
But now it looks like the plug is different when you're listening to the new Zagar record.
Yonderboi's appearance, some new and exciting productions from the digital underground in Hungary slowly change the overall picture, and in vain fashion again the guitar-making garage rock, the Hungarian electropop also proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zuser started in Pécs, and you played in Yonderboi's band, while, perhaps, because two horns didn't fit in a casket, you went on your own way.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, which combines the elements of jazz, electronic dance music, pop, but began to break through when film soundtracks were asked to be composed (e.g.
Ferenc Törk (French of Turkey)).
At the beginning, the audience discovered the formations of smaller clubs when the first album ofwan2 was classified as one of the fifty most important Hungarian albums in 2002, and Zagar, in Yonderboi's company, was declared to be almost the only Hungarian marketable trendmakers in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and orchestra became "trend", but of course no one asked them if they would like to wear the label.
The band reacted the way it had to: made a new, better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to create continuity with the early years of Pécs.
This was one of the ranks of the old band of Balázs Zuser.
We'd be on the ground with the flying reference, but along with the aeriality of music, the effect of a louder guitar, a rock and a roll has now appeared, in line with the spirit and trend of age.
In these songs, György Ligeti, currently working with The Puzzle band in England, showed himself at the premiere of the album in Millennium.
The album also produced a real radio speaker, and Mr2 Petőfi, who recently played popular music from morning to evening, began to smuggle the songs of the Wings of Love in the ears with the six Hungarian singers ("underground Divas").
So all is well (?).
Häg.hu asked Balázs Zuseer.
hvg.hu: With this new hit, the question now is: How much layer music do you have left to play?
Balázs Zuser: The definition of stratification does not mean much to me.
I think there are two kinds of easy music casts; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
The so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, unspeakable, and likewise prepared for sale only, which makes them commercial.
But a good pop can come from an honest motive.
The host attitude also works in the spirit of this, regardless of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
Zs.B.: In foreign countries, mainly westwards, light music has greater traditions.
It's not only the 16-year-olds who go to concerts there, it's the older ones.
They are much more monitoring the changes in light music around them, because they are also considered part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people are going to our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
We have music, not for purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be felt in concerts where the effect is already on each other, but it only lies in the inexplicable changes of the moment.
Yet, I noticed that if you want to answer to the audience, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far are you planning to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's working solo, and he's built his career west of us.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path, regardless of sometimes trying to explain this to our music.
We're more of a team player who trusts the other music and lets it develop.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work was compared to Yonderboi’s music, since many of us came from his band and left on another road.
hvg.hu: The top list of Mr2 Petőfi puts Wings of Love first.
Many first heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Have you deliberately opened up a more popular style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a hit and then sell the record.
This song is about more than that.
It was designed for the finale of the album, which we tried to solve the sound orgy on the disc and the more difficult subjects.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guiding principle?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
That's when we came up with the idea of putting this choir together from the good soloists of our own musical scene in Hungary.
This is how the six-member choir - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Jude Jay, Peterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], Németh Juci - was formed, which we then baptized under the name Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is the song designed or played by the girls?
Zs.B.: The number has long existed in the instrumental version, and then when the record came together, we thought we needed something else for that number.
The chorus attracted me to singing.
I still sang the tune that night, which the girls later learned.
It was almost first and scaryly spontaneous.
I remember he was very excited back then, but of course he needed the Divas.
It wouldn't have worked that hard with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
There is no solo (except Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role to play, they sing together completely and are not louder than music, so music is not just accompanied by their songs.
They were on the backstage.
Is that deliberate?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were standing in the back was purely technical problems.
But it is conscious that we did not want to play solo.
The number is also about forgetting our ego a little bit, where he came from, where he was headed, just letting those wings of love lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: What was the most work with?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the musical creative processes were, rather, more difficult than mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play at a racing piano or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work for a long time, and then slowly everything was in place like a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite song about the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes all the time with the concert and the fact that I've already released the album.
Now the Prophet Is The Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The traitor broker risked billions because of a sense of inferiority
Infidel sarcastic.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French Sociéte Générale bankor, calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Kerviel lost almost EUR 5 billion.
However, it seems that Kerviel was more than just a big player who wanted to reach his colleagues.
Unlike the other banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He has reduced mental ability," he said from the police reporting officers.
However, as reported by the French Le Monde, Kerviel's statement shows that at the end of last year, he made a profit of EUR 1.6 billion of his business.
Crisis Not Only in America
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros in the American crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, news has appeared that there will be problems with so-called subprime mortgages to low-income customers or customers with past payment problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe this and put me on a good horse.
Profit at the end of the year reached EUR 1.6 billion.
"Even when I was looking for the first half billion, I didn't know how to announce," admits Kerviel and adds that he didn't keep anything for himself.
In his confession, he admitted that he faked his reports so that it could not be discovered.
Even when Eurex's stock exchange started to interest him in his business, he managed to trick his bosses.
The risk was a profit
Were you afraid to find out?
I'd rather not.
"I thought the fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would reassure them."
Where did he want to risk so much?
He's gradually reached his position.
He worked at Société Générale Bank since 2000 after completing the University of Ilon.
His annual salary moved around $51,000.
Two years later, he was a broker and became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000 in 2005.
Even so, he knew he'd never make as much money as anyone else.
"In 2005, during my first conversation, I knew they were looking at me with a bad eye.
Because of my career, professional and personal development," Kerviel told the detectives.
Soon after he entered, the first great success came.
Thanks to Allianz's shares, he was looking for half a billion euros in the fall of these shares during the London bombings.
And that started avalanche - he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses were supposed to know everything, or rather suspected.
While I was making money, they closed their eyes.
Except there was a blow at the beginning of the year.
One day he lost a billion euros.
He wanted to cover it up in mid-January a weekend.
When he left for work on Monday, he stopped working at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it lost EUR 5 billion.
And how did they find out?
He became suspicious because of his freedom.
"I've only been out for four days in the last year.
A broker who has no freedom, a broker who doesn't want anyone to look into his reports," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic is likely to acquire 365 billion
The Czech Government’s ministers signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euro in the coming years (about 365 billion kroons).
The Czech Republic has approximately half of the total amount available from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
The total cost of the seven operational programmes in the regions is approximately DKK 125 billion.
Czech companies will be able to obtain an amount of around 100 billion kroons from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most money, 150 billion kroons, is for transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operating programme and accounts for 22% of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state funding of transport infrastructure, which will be managed by the next year by 90.8 billion kroons.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme will help entrepreneurs and companies to win the means for innovation enterprises.
Companies should also raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful in winning EU funds so far within the framework of the newly adopted countries.
The court approved the 20-year prison sentence of the ex-president of Nicaragua
On Thursday, the Judiciary Court of Appeal approved a 20-year prison sentence for the former President of Arnold Alemán, who was sentenced to 100 million dollars in 2003 for financial fraud (almost EEK 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and house arrested in his hacienda near the capital.
Whether or not the former leader of this Central American country between 1997 and 2002 will return to behind bars is not yet clear, according to the AP News Agency.
According to Ileana Perez, the President of the Court of Appeal, it will depend on the head of the prison to leave Aleman's punishment to be charged at home or to return to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alemán that he regularly referred government funds to foreign company accounts in Panama.
These fictitious companies and their account numbers were, in reality, related to their nearest supporters.
He then carried out these funds at some of the foundations, which he founded to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Our budget has been approved
That's right.
They accepted the state budget.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget prepared by this government, adopted by a coalition majority, without support from the opposition.
This year, with the support of social Democrats, was still the case last year, since Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not accept non-acceptance.
Unlike the debate on the lack of confidence in the government before the vote, there has been no drama this time.
This was generally ignored by the House, although the most influential law was adopted.
That's a certain contradiction.
All government starts and ends with certain chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the forces of the government and the opposition.
This is more grateful to the press, which is why you get much more attention in the media.
The debate among politicians is much more interesting to the public than mere figures.
The public budgets of the social democratic governments in the past have faced three shortcomings which the 2008 budget is unable to resolve at the same time:
The first is the high rate of mandatory "creditor's spending law", which means not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year by ČSDD and KSČM's silent "coalitation" before the elections.
The second is as a result of the first flaw in the management of deficits.
The third limit is the deficits of public funding, i.e. the deficits of the budgets of cities and walks.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the public budget.
This is public and relatively controlled.
Timed bombs are deficits in the budgets of cities and walks.
Many mayors can also obtain money for investments other than those resulting from taxes, levies and bank loans, and have incestuously often issued bonds with which their city halls are disproportionately indebtednessd.
In recent years, these debts have been offset by the mass sale of shares in the energy and other distribution networks received from the State through privatisations.
They don't have such a source anymore.
If we rely only on the official and verifiable facts, we shall establish that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase for a few years, with which the Czech Social Democratic Party continues to boast.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to restructure public funding.
Instead, the country was increasingly in debt.
With two exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, the other countries have been far more rational than the Czech Republic.
This is, above all, the enormous shame of previous governments.
We belong to the countries that are least threatened by poverty in global terms.
This is why, for example, there is no need for huge social programmes, which have, unfortunately, become giant-sized in recent years.
Although this year we managed to eliminate the part of the pointless populist expenditure approved before the elections this year, even if the limit of retirement and pension reform will not be pushed out in the near future, any policy in this country will actually end and whoever governs it will only be official.
A little overkill is the fact that the majority of the paid-up money in the governor's politicians are usually pensioned and social benefits become their mechanical distributors.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop the repressive expenditure of normal expenditure.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if the previous governments had not lost everything they could have done in the last decade.
If we do not really want to see mere officials become governors, then we must be patient and wish for peace of mind in the preparation of further reform laws for this strong, well-known coalition government that the state can only issue what it can obtain from taxes and taxes.
They are the only ones that allow the balanced budget to be gradually achieved.
Member of the Commission
The banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the central banks of Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
Financial markets are thus costing more than $100 billion through the stock exchange.
The interest rate on these exchanges is increased at the bank, for which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will put 40 billion dollars on the stock market and will make another twenty-four available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the 11th of September that national central banks have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote to their customers in his report by Bernard Baumohl, the consulting company of the Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of central banks in the United States reduced the probability of recession from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
The banks have already lost 60 billion dollars in the United States in particular due to outstanding loans.
Analysts are still expecting billions more losses.
"Central banks may indeed be afraid of what might happen if they decided on such a procedure," said Kieran Davies, the general economist of ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that if their own banks have difficulty accessing loans, they will also provide more expensive loans to their clients.
This would reduce the need and put the American economy in recession with the potential consequences of global economic growth.
The central banks decided that the so-called LIBOR, the interbank supply rate in London, would not be reduced, which is used to borrow money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of mutual money lending, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain also decreased their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This further reduction in interest rates will have a similar effect," said Greg Salvaggio to the Reuters news agency from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the move of central banks contributes to the resolution of the crisis, as it does not solve the fundamental problem of the fall of the American real estate market.
Klaus: The incredible disputes of the ecologicalists
Global climate change is the main threat facing developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again gave an opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time, the UN International Conference on Climate Change held in Bali criticised.
The book Blue, presented in Vienna, did not mention the green planet, that the disputes of the ecology are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is formed by a particular mixture of governments and civil society organisations, but also by the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality that accompanys it.
"The debate there absolutely lacks the structure, it's just a waste of words, which are a substitute for solving the current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of the Czech President's book, he stressed that it was very important for his subject, and that is why he was so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction at the fact that the book is also published in German translation, because, as he said, "I often only meet the cartoons of my opinion".
Now, therefore, interested parties can read their undistorted opinion.
Klaus reminded me that although he was not a climatologist, he considered that he had sufficient grounds to write such a book.
Because he was able to monitor and evaluate professional studies in statistics and also an economist.
At the end of the book, he stated as a thesis that climate change is constantly changing, that is, changes are normal, and that all scientists do not agree that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious, and therefore do not constitute a threat, and that the efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
In addition, as a person with experience in totalitarianism, it considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which it sees as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He once again explained to those present that "it is not against the rational protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take account of the link between costs and their benefits".
Klaus spoke about a similar subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand of them couldn't change their licenses
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and could not replace their old licence in time, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last time they can still apply for a change so that the agencies can issue the new licence in due time by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that, after the new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will take off without valid authorisation.
According to the offices, the licence was not replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While the walks are a sharp fall in interest in licence exchanges, the capital offices have been flooded with applications for licence exchanges, for which interest has increased this week.
The Mayor's Office receives about 2,000 customers a day.
It takes about half an hour to line up.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers did not replace the driver.
The issue of a new licence lasts 20 days.
However, the new licence may be requested with a short period of five days.
However, in such a case, the driver will have to pay an additional 500 kroner.
Drivers who are unable to complete the mandatory licence exchange by the end of the year and who are on the road with an invalid licence are threatened with punishment from January.
The culprit must pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police, however, may also settle the violation by means of an agreement.
In the event of administrative misconduct, the penalty shall be EEK 2500.
Based on earlier information from the city hall, you can also get a fine from someone who doesn't travel anywhere.
It's supposed to cost up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry has previously called on the agencies to be lenient and to impose a maximum of a thousand crowns.
However, according to Karel Hanzelka, the Minister of Transport's spokesperson, tens of thousands of fines do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the license is a document where people can decide whether or not they want to.
This is not an I.D. that must be valid for everyone.
Those of you who don't want to drive should give up your license.
It is enough to take it or to recommend it to the appropriate office by post.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will no longer be valid.
However, drivers must gradually replace the other types of licence.
Those with documents from 1994 - 2000 can be replaced for another three years.
The validity of licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires only in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, there are some 2.6 million additional documents.
The court reduced the sentence for detectives co-operative with Berdycchel
Josef Opava and Petr Koňačík were former police officers suspected of conspiring with David Berdych's criminal organization and were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison.
Of this, the Supreme Court of Prague has determined its final effect, which has reduced its punishment to one of them for two years.
Detectives of the Prague Organization of Crime Division were originally threatened by a 14 and 12-year-old prison.
Today's decision cannot be appealed; a review can only be applied to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdyche is also suspected in this case, he is only awaiting a first sentence.
In other procedures, he has already been punished for more than 16 years.
You can't have any more.
In January, the County Court of Justice found 19 people primarily guilty of armed robbery, of which 16 have today been heard by the Supreme Court.
Most of the defendants rejected the charges from the start of the investigation by referring to speculation.
According to the Central-Czech Senate, after agreement with Berdycche, other criminals provided information from police sources, covered individual robberies and helped the gang avoid criminal prosecution.
The gang therefore gave 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Koňałiq.
The charge is about the gang's crimes between 1999 and 2001.
It is primarily a robbery that has often suffered serious damage to health, but also abuses of civil servants' powers and unauthorized possession of weapons.
Because police found illegal weapons, steel-tongued bullets, laser guidance, or machine gun during house search.
The gang has accused the robbery of using tens of millions of crowns.
A group of less than 20 in this procedure has already been found legally guilty by the courts of other robberies of Berdych and many others.
Other members of Berdych’s environment will testify before the court in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The first-stage trial has so far avoided Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulej, who are under prior arrest in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their release to the Czech Republic.
Account for child exchange: 12 million
For children exchanged in maternity, Igor Veleba, the Lawyer of Harmonized Families, requires 12 million kroons of pain from the hospital in Těebíč, plus court expenses.
Three million for mothers, two million for fathers, and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Onděej Dostal Veleba, disagrees in principle with the proposal.
"We reject such a claim because it is too much," said Dostal after today's trial.
"To give us an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert opinion developed by the opponent.
We'll find out if there's any usable value at all.
But we maintain our opinion that this will be measurable for all hundreds of thousands," said Dostal.
According to him, the sum should be between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for the four parents.
At the start of the case, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns for every month until he raised their own biological daughter.
Veleba received an expert review on the basis of which the compensation negotiations were conducted by the University Hospital of Motol in Prague.
Children’s parents, according to psychologists and psychiatrists, suffered various degrees of mental harm and stress.
The stress situation was more tolerated by men, even though they had to face such a blasphemy that they did not prevent the replacement of a newborn.
Women are struggling worse with the timing of the trauma and what's happening right now, he's summed up the contents of Himeba.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses on 9 December in the t'ébíč obstetrics.
Last week, the children returned to their blood parents - Nikola Čermák's Pòibyslavica, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, Vysočina's head of staff, Miloš Vystrčil, gave families 100 000 kroons to compensate for their expenses resulting from the error of the hospital in Těebíčské, which is managed by the municipality.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic have compulsory insurance under the law.
In the event of a mistake, they shall extend to the reserve fund, in exceptional cases, they may request the assistance of the founder.
The courts have so far approved relatively low compensation for people, and the amounts have been calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand, exceptionally a few million kroons.
Polivka has lost the kingdom of Viassko
Bolek Políka lost the lawsuit for the Kingdom of VIASCO.
According to the judge of the Ostrava City Court, although he was the first to use the name of the King of Valach, the project was developed by the team of Tomáš Harabiš, who cooperated with the actor, with many years of work.
Polivka didn't attend the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr. Harabiš and his team living in Bolek Políka's popularity," said Políka's lawyer after the trial.
He thinks the words of the Kingdom of Valachi make everyone think of the actor-comic.
This opinion is shared by Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Searching for money and making up operations," he said.
He thinks the reason for the debate is money.
"In years, they discovered that the project was successful and could gain something from it.
They want to live from our work," he added.
Profitability, cash flow, investments and return on investments
According to the court, the King of Valach used the name Polivka for the first time in his television show.
He was crowned in 1993 by Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At that time, however, this was not related to the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing the velvet passports.
The original student plot became a business and profitable business activity, on which Harabiš founded the creation of the State of the Viaško.
In 1997, Políka agreed to the name and signature in the passports, and even offered discounts to their owners when visiting their farm and theatre performances.
Who takes the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabiš himself had only used the idea, which Políkka made public in the Manesis.
"The popularity of Boleslav Políka has certainly helped the Kingdom of Valachi project," the judge said.
However, he added that the spirit of the project was the intensive Harabiš and his team.
The co-operation of today's parties continued until the year 2000, when Harabiš Polika organized an official coronation in Vsetín.
Since then, however, there have been debates between Políka and Harabiš, which have been forced into the release of "King Boleslav, who has been elected forever".
In the kingdom, Jarmila Šulákova took the lead on the initiative of Harabiš, as queen of mothers.
In 2002, Políka Harabiš and his associates brought a court action, which the court rejected today.
The battle designed by Harabiš could bring light to the debate for the throne and for the queen's half.
This fight should be a new king.
He didn't want to tell me the details and the date.
"We don't want to catch anything.
This is supposed to be something like the Slovacko Royal.
The king should be chosen for a certain period of time.
Mr. Políka is welcome to apply," added Harabiš.
Test of 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot: critical prejudices
Honestly, I never liked Peugeot 206.
The characteristics of the process are nothing special, the quality of the change, the driving and the production are often described as below average.
But the successor to Peugeot 207 already on the market is significantly better.
And the combination called SW goes a little further, so for me, there's nothing left but to think about it.
When I tested Peugeot's 207 classic hatchback, for example, I complained in the back seat about the place left for the head.
This time, the complaint is over, as the combination’s bodywork means that the giants, two metres high, are not suffering in this regard.
Quick in the World
I'll get through the inner space soon so I don't repeat myself many times.
It's a relatively successful design, where I have the only excuse for the poor console.
I'd appreciate a little more designer inventory here, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and where are the times when we complained about the short lower part of the seat or the arms.
The lateral leadership has also improved significantly against the 206 model.
As far as space is concerned, there is also an increase in the size of the bodywork.
In the combination, the head disappears from the mentioned few places.
Skinbag in the trunk
The main part of this vehicle is therefore its trunk.
This should be assessed as very accessible (even thanks to the foldable rear window) and as a large area.
The empty spaces are equipped with containers, which are ideal compromises.
They're not in the way, they're tearable, and they can handle heavy objects.
But let's just stick to the volume.
This is based on the tables in the fund arrangement of 428 l, which is more of an average value compared to competition.
However, in the Czech Republic, it is not the most sought-after vehicle in this class - Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with the new generation product of mlada boleslav, we find that Peugeot is well behind a considerable number of 52 litres.
This value is almost critical for a holiday abroad or when a baby car is fitted.
But if I had to highlight the positives, I would have to mention the almost completely straight floor after pulling off the backs of the second row or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car tested by us was equipped with a volume of 1.6 l, 88 kW power-driven four-cylinder, non-reflecting engines.
And to tell you the truth, it should look like the thousand-sixth century that drives the family hatchback.
It's quiet, it's low consumption, and it's pulling.
If you compare it to your Škoda match, which often works like a rag in your exhaust, then I can only be happy about that.
It's the price.
Car prices aren't cheap.
We must remember, however, that we have tested a large interior and a car equipped with a very good engine.
The car is still leaving for 329 900 Kč with a four-wheeled alien engine.
The car starts with 410 990 Kč, which is quite a lot.
The equipment of the tested Premium throws the equipment with an additional 80 000 Kč.
But for us, we still had our headbands, our automatic climate, our automatic window wiper launch, our back windows had electric remote control...
Which means the car's full-loaded tow is 531 900 Kč.
This is a lot, but count the additional equipment of Fabia and get very similar results.
So there's nothing left but a brand-side decision.
Unable to integrate Slovak students in British schools
In British schools, more and more children in Eastern Europe are worrying about the further development of local school affairs.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases where disputes between the children of immigrants and domestic residents have become violent.
The problems with the integration of children in Eastern Europe are well illustrated in a case in northern Kent, where disputes between their seats and Slovak immigrants are increasing.
Conflicts and ties between students are already a feature of parents’ relationships.
The situation got so far that in Chatham, the police took into custody a Slovak woman who used iron bars to tell a ten-year-old student.
The culprit protects him by insulting him with racist pigs.
The police had to act after two twelve-year-old girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
The girls are said to have reproached the man with racist comments and thrown stones at him.
"When we were on our way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and began to spit on us.
When I told him to stop doing this, he hit us with apples and pears, and then he exposed his naked butt," the Slovak students' mother described another unpleasant incident for The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One of the local residents classified the debate on immigrants in Eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming tense.
In Great Britain, 70,000 Slovaks seeking employment are registered.
About 30,000 Slovak students go to British schools.
The most beautiful island in the Caribbean region of Cuba
For visitors, it is indeed an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, this can be done if you choose correctly.
The golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, are calm as a fish.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or mamor cocktails on the beach.
Kite surfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean, you can find this in a full and even richer list.
On an island, however, you can find much more, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antiques.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was the throne of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place human eyes have ever seen.
Havana has become a treasure warehouse and a transhipment site, which the Spaniards robbed and shipped to Europe in America.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the American mob, built it because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (primarily alcoholism) was welcomed in Cuba and supported drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were:
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana tower houses were built, cars that became the symbol of the cult of the 50s of the last century were on broad roads.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his own yacht in Cojímar.
The Bodeguita del Medio walls are decorated with the signatures of the stars and politicians of American show business.
And today?
You can provide the Havana Bodeguita wall with your handwriting.
In the precious Nacional Hotel bar, you will be mixed with cocktails as desired.
And the cars of the 50s cult are still in Havana, because the once exported glare and your son in this salty and wet air have long since been rotting away.
Even though the oldest part of Havana is considerably stunned, there is still no such beautiful colonial monument anywhere else in the area as it is there.
Other places are becoming more beautiful, like Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides the necessary money, its development has been given a green light.
For the last 15 years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana, but also in Varader, on the coast of Holguín Province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
In the world, Cuba offers yet another unique taste, which is appreciated primarily by train fans.
From their extended plantations, sugar cane was delivered to sugar factories by steam and motor trains.
Their motor parks have not been renewed for decades, so they can see machines operating there, which are now only visible in museums elsewhere.
Where should we go?
Most of the best-known places are not avoided by the majority of Cuban visitors.
So there's no need to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Maybe we should just remind him that there is a museum on the already mentioned Hemingways, and whoever loves the writer doesn't have to miss a visit to this museum.
One of the most picturesque parts of the Viňales Valley, Cuba, is the western part of the island.
The lush vegetation grows out of a mortar.
Stone formations, lime-mountains and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and fertile soils are accumulated in their hollows, which also means dense vegetation is covered with broken petacles.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
They can meet their final form at the visit of a cigar factory in Havana.
Some may also find it interesting that Major Zeman's Chilean episode was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish island colonization.
The slave and sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy has a body in the beauty and monumentality of a non-big city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, which was significantly influenced by the later French settlers, has changed for almost four centuries.
The Trinidad area between the Escambray plain and the sea is so secluded that even in the 50s of the last century, there were no roads connected to the rest of the country.
That particular isolation helped him stay outside.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't break down, everyone was happy that there was a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth looking at the interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Sugar Factory valley.
In the evening, it is appropriate to go to Casa de la Música, which will wake up after dark, where the music will be quiet only in the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful city.
Surely this opinion is already influenced by the road itself.
Both roads from Guantanamo have to overcome high and fragmented mountains, they pass through a natural environment that is hardly affected by human activity.
Due to the untouched nature of Cuba’s eastern language, UNESCO has been added to the list of world heritage.
This is where his best chocolate is made, the church has a Columbus cross (in reality made a hundred years after Columbus sailed) and the hill where the former castle stood and the El Castillo Hotel is now standing, some of the tables are visible, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
The coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Metro plain, the Bay of Pigs and the Island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the St. Caridad del Cobra of Cuba, the Santeria, the African religion, which is a great deal to be written about.
I mean, as they say correctly, it's better to see it once.
The Afghan allies are passive, claimed by the Americans
Few soldiers and lack of the necessary equipment also influence the United States' mission to Afghanistan.
Robert Gates, Minister of Defence, said that NATO should draw up concrete plans for the coming years.
The Afghanistan mission is not according to the idea that the leaders of the countries in Edinburgh, Scotland, with units in the south of the country, have agreed.
In addition to the growing resistance to the Taliban movement, eight participating countries are also discussing further plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States, with the help of Robert Gates Minister of Defence, called for more activity this week for NATO troops, Great Britain considers the strengthening of the Afghan Government and the strengthening of development aid to be a priority.
"Development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is allowing the population to start further development of the economy and security themselves," said the British Minister for Defence Des Browne to the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the U.S. government, the activity of Afghan rebels has been the strongest in the last five years.
The number of acts of violence increased by 27 per cent compared to last year and by 60 per cent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about one quarter in the southern territories.
However, according to the United States, allies also reached their borders in the organization and equipment of the teams.
More helicopters, soldiers and experts were specifically requested to train Afghan troops.
"We really need to think about the specific goals for the future and how to achieve them," . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He spoke in a similar spirit today to Jaap de Hoop, the Secretary-General of NATO.
"I'm not happy with what's happening in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's few," said De Hoop to the Reuters News Agency at the end of the three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
In recent months, there have also been discussions among the participating countries as to whether all the allies provide the maximum in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticised for its passivity.
"The Germans are in relatively large numbers in Afghanistan.
However, they were introduced in areas where violence and fighting requirements are the least, so they are not as high against them as they are against us in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The Sun British bulldozer this week called German soldiers lazy.
"The Afghan diaries have been exposed: The Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in material supplemented by a photograph of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild launched a counterattack and published a photo of a British team's football game in the south of Afghanistan.
Government debt reaches one billion in 2009
Every Czech Republic has 84,000 kroons of state debt.
The total debt reached EEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
This year, the government plans to raise a loan of GBP 159.2 billion.
By the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced this plan by SEK 152.8 billion thanks to the improved development of the public budget.
At the end of September, the Czech Republic’s government debt reached EEK 842.7 billion.
During the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion kroons.
However, it decreased by 13.4 billion kroons from June.
The Ministry of Finance thus today verified its sovereign debt data from early October.
Each Czech Republic has more than 84,000 kroons of debt.
Last year, the state owed more than 11 billion kroons.
"For the time being, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit next year, we could only go beyond the one billion crown limit in 2009.
The next year the debt will move around 900 billion kroons and one trillion kroons," said David Marek, Analyst of Patria Finance, the server of iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, Analyst of Next Finance, sees this: "In the course of 2009, we can cross the path of a trillion.
When exactly, the budget we don't know for now depends on the next budget.
If it were to be proved that the situation in the policy area would change, politicians would be prepared to save more, and this could move away by 2010.
But I'm not assuming this change," he said.
Increased debts
Public debt consists of central government debt, which is mainly generated by the accumulation of deficits in the public budget.
Public debt is financed by cash registers, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has increased by 38,5 billion to 71,4 billion kroons this year.
The foreign debt of the State has for the time being increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion kroons.
By the end of September, the so-called "sellable government debt" amounted to EEK 803.3 billion and decreased by EEK 13.7 billion from June.
The average maturity of government debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The debt between the whole year increased by 13 per cent in the first quarter, which is indeed quite a lot compared to economic progress.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by the loan bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows what it's going to do to trade when the pension reform is here," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of government debt in 2007 show that the government planned to raise a loan of GBP 159.2 billion this year.
By the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan by SEK 152.8 billion thanks to the improved development of the public budget.
The amount is primarily the deficit of the public budget, which is likely to reach the estimated kroon of EEK 91.3 billion instead of EEK 76 billion this year.
In addition, the Czech Consolidation Agency has planned a maximum of EEK 13,3 billion, a ten billion reserve for the payment of pensions, a EUR 43 billion financing of public loans and a payment of EEK 1,8 billion of loans from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher shows up in front of a Caromian court today because of a name given to a teddy bear.
On Thursday night, a court in Carpathian sentenced the British teacher in Sudan to 15 days in prison and deportation for the abuse of Islam, his lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her students from six to seven years of age to be named Muhammad, but the Islamic religion prohibits any representation of her prophet.
Such an act can be punished with a whip.
The 54-year-old British woman, who was arrested at her own apartment by a teacher at the Unity High School in Carthum, was charged with the violation and rebellion of Islam under paragraph 125 of the Sudan Penal Code, after several complaints were made by her parents at the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her students to choose a name for the class's pluss bear.
"The children suggested a total of eight names, including Haszán, Abdullah and Mohammed," says Robert Boulos, the school director.
Finally, 20 out of 23 children voted for the first name Muhammad.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but also a very common first name in Sudan.
The kids then took a common diary with the picture of the bear and labeled "My Name Muhammad."
The problem is that any representation of the Prophet is a violation of Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' colleagues at the same school told me that he knew her well, and that the teacher would never have done anything to offend any religious belief. He said it was only a "innocent mistake": "I'm sorry that she voted with the children".
Many students of the teacher agree with this opinion, and they think that the teacher is "very good with the children" and "Never speaks of religion in the class".
Let us not forget that Muhammad is the second most popular first name in Great Britain, and there are 14 different forms of writing in English.
This is the first name so often chosen by Muslim families to express respect for the prophet. ( Often, this name is given by the firstborn child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of the first name?
Can this name be given to a game, for example?
It's obviously a question of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last meeting in Vienna on Wednesday.
The result is failure.
Without convergence of positions, the meeting between the Serbs and the Albanians in Kosovo ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, the sixth and last meeting on the future status of the separatist province.
"Unfortunately, the parties have not reached agreement on the status," said Wolfgang Ischinger's EU diploma at a press conference in Vienna.
The American ambassador, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region is at stake and encouraged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after negotiations.
"There is no need to fear violence in the near future, but there is a very difficult time," he added, stressing "the existence of apparent tensions".
The transmission ends on December 10th
Last visit to Serbia and Kosovo on Monday is the mediation troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia.
The future of the Albanian province can be clarified in 90 percent, after Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator, Aleksandr Bocan-Harchenko, submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The meeting in Baden near Vienna has reported the sixth and final meeting of the negotiations since the UN commissioned the troika in August last year.
The Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation mission will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, insist that negotiations continue after the deadline has expired.
"Russia was committed, and that remains the negotiated solution, in favour of the compromise," said Boca-Harchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After being under the leadership of the UN for 8 years in Kosovo, the Western authorities believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina stated that she was prepared to declare her independence unilaterally if the Security Council did not decide for her.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have failed to reach an agreement," announced the president of the independent province of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden, where "the last chance negotiations" have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed his regret.
He added, however, that the idea of autonomy in Belgrade would be "to continue the past of murder and deportation".
"Domino Effect"
The Serbian President, Boris Tadic, thought that the compromise was still possible, and the Albanian majority in Kosovo was warned about the consequences of the unilateral exclamation of independence.
Because Belgrade is afraid of a "domino effect" due to the wars of independence in the nineties still in a unstable area.
"For Serbia, this does not preclude the possibility of compromise", said Tadic.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision should be exclusively for the Security Council, where the Russian ally has veto rights.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word."
"For Serbia only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable", said the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"The negotiations were held for two years.
They must end in the same place as they began: the Security Council".
Fatmir Sejdiu said to the journalists that "the Kosovo Parliament will be the last word". He added that the unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians is based on "conclusion with the Western powers".
Bush urges an agreement between Israel and Palestine
On Tuesday, at the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, President George Bush announced that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmúd Abbas agreed to enter into negotiations immediately to resolve the 60-year debate between their peoples.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush promised to support them in all possible ways so that they could still sign the "peace Agreement" in 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must abandon the "terrorist networks" and Israel must cease its colonization activities, said Bush, and reminded the two parties of their commitments to the peace plan adopted in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the aim of the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, led by Abbas, was to "sign a peace agreement with which all pending problems, including central issues, will be resolved".
The latter address three delicate problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation in Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who lived in the territory of the state of Israel today during the 1948 conflict.
Abbas, who spoke after the President of the United States, insisted that future negotiations should be 'global and in-depth' and touch all areas of regulation, such as 'Jerusalem, asylum, borders, colonies, water and security'.
Then Olmert, on the stand, promised that future negotiations would be "indirect and continuous", and he would strive to "end in 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush set out the implementation of the "vision of two states" of Palestine and Israel, which exist next to each other.
Saudi Arabia stated that Bush had promised this before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose Annapolis participation was recorded as a success in Washington, initiated, with the support of all Arab countries, a plan to guarantee Israel peace if it withdraws from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis "is an answer in the history of the Middle East, especially because it takes the problem at its root and focuses on central issues" - thinks the Saudi Prince in his interview with Saudi Arabian daily newspaper.
The D.A. says the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with this type of news, the official position and the rumor conflict.
How was the accident?
According to the first investigation conducted by the General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN) on Sunday, after a few minutes at 17 o'clock, a police car moved on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Beel.
"The car was patrolling, so it wasn't in action. It was going at 40 to 50 km/h without sirens," we learned from the police source.
The two unscrupulous young "high speed" driven by a green, "not included in the official register, therefore not used in road traffic" (see below) with Kawasaki brand engine.
"Because they didn't follow the right-hand rule, the engine hit the left side of the police car," says a police officer.
The result of the alcohol test on the passengers of the vehicle was negative.
The strength of the impact is shown by the fact that the front of the car was covered, the windshield in the shape of the star was cracked, and the bumper was torn down.
In his extraordinary announcement yesterday morning, the State Prosecutor of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that he had entrusted IGPN and the Val-D'Oise County Public Security Directorate with the investigation, which was initiated by the "death of manslaughter and helplessness".
During the afternoon, at a press conference, the D.A. said that, at this stage of the investigation of IGPN, the responsibility of the police could be excluded.
According to the D.A., three witnesses questioned by the accident on Sunday evening confirmed "the police report that the bomber arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car."
Yesterday out of a stripe, which was undoubtedly pulled by the footmen on the roadside, the two vehicles collapsed and went together for a while until the police car could stop.
The vehicles have been seized for technical testing purposes.
The bodies of the two victims were examined yesterday by a medical examiner.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, the rumor spread that policemen quickly left the scene without helping the youngsters.
In this regard, IGPN is cautious, but it excludes the police from making any "serious mistake".
"This is the hardest part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation, and in doing so we have learned from the police source.
Libration met a witness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of his apartment windows looks exactly at the scene.
"With my cousin, who is a hospital nurse, we immediately went to try to resuscitate them," says the witness.
"There's nothing we can do."
Then he noticed "a cop who was completely disturbed and limped.
The other two tried to resuscitate one young man and the other called."
The tension among those present grew, as the hopeless situation of the two young people became apparent, so incoming policemen carried their colleagues from the scene by car.
We also know from the witness's announcement that the ambulance arrived about 20 minutes after the police left.
They used a heart massage, but they didn't.
"I wouldn't say the police didn't try to help the young.
Young people were helped.
The firefighters have arrived at the scene immediately.
They did everything they could to save them," the D.A. stressed.
The tension in Pakistan is increasing
On Monday, the Pakistani police stopped the first demonstrations after the emergency, introduced by General Musarraf, two days earlier.
Witnesses believe that about 2,000 lawyers protesting the emergency measures in the eastern part of Lahore were wounded by the tear-gas bombs used by the law enforcement forces.
In response, they threw stones at the police, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were manufactured.
Similar events took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and wounded the lawyers.
More people were produced.
In Islamabad, the registered lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and reported demonstrations of the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning, streets to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
There were also several demonstrations in Multan and Peshawar, the Northwest.
Since Monday, the lawyers' movement has also been supported by the huge Agahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, which includes religious parties. His leader encouraged the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the need card and trash to those who took an oath before Musarraf.
"Musarraf's promise is no longer valid."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure announced on Saturday night.
The Court of Justice shall declare in the coming days the legality of the re-election of President Musarraf by an indirect vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed and replaced.
"All that we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court," the president said to the newspaper The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise that he would leave the army for the purpose of fulfilling the role of civilian president was "deceased" after the emergency, announced on Monday the Deputy Minister of Information, Tariq Azeem.
Musarraf had to leave the military uniform until 15 November, i.e. the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
By the way, the Pakistani government disproved the nationwide proverb that President Musarraf would have appointed a deputy general.
More than one third of pregnant women are not planned
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unintended or unintended pregnancy.
Even today, more than a third of pregnancy (36%) is not planned - 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act liberalising contraception, the study of the French National Institute of Demographics (Ined) reveals.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unintended or unintended pregnancy.
Ined estimates that various methods of contraception, such as tablets or beeswax, still fail in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the Institute, the liberalisation of contraception has made "counselling" more effective. The study notes that only 5% of women aged 20 to 44 have taken birth control pills in 1970, but this rate is now 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnant women are planned.
Every fifth one has a couple of months of accuracy, and if possible, it's for the spring, because this is the most favorable season for having a child.
Spectacular repair of space station
Assemblies Scott Parazynski and the International Space Station (ISS) had to work more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular repair of a broken solar panel essential for the scientific activity of the station.
This dangerous space walk has proved to be a record in many respects: the repair took a very long time, very little time to plan it, and had to be done away from the residential modules with the tools "moved" by astronauts.
The problem occurred on Tuesday when astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. This is a huge cylinder-shaped element that will soon be the location of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see box).
This module is a kind of gateway to the laboratory modules.
However, care must be taken with regard to their power supply.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to transfer one of the modules that produced electricity using the 17.5 tonnes solar panels, which was already on the ISS, to its final location.
The crew then started opening the module’s 76 - meter - wide solar panels.
One of the harmoniously foldable tablets was then damaged by a fixed cable at a length of about 1 metre.
In order to avoid further injury, the table has not been opened.
The purpose of the astronauts was originally to take a control walk from Discovery's space shuttle and then fix another malfunctioned solar solar panel. Instead, they had to devote their full time to repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski had a choice to hang out on a 30-metre robot arm attached to the ship of the space shuttle.
He's one of NASA's best space walkers.
He's tall, strong, extremely good, he's got a muscular upper body and a long arm.
So the 46-year-old doctor-qualified man had to "react" the "damaged" solar panel.
After a thorough assessment of the damage caused, he cut the defective cable and fixed the damaged area with a few lines.
In his work he was also assisted by another "space walker" who remained near the safe passage, as well as by other astronauts, including crew captain Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini-hokibot, which was provided by insulation against hundreds of volts of solar panels, was fired by the station's astronauts and "sealed" together.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until his associates opened the board completely, and only after that he packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took a half-day rest, and today they returned the Discovery Space Chlora to begin their return to Wednesday.
The exchange rate of the EADS shares is decreasing
The exchange rate of EADS shares has fallen greatly on the Paris Stock Exchange after the company that manufactures aircraft and protective equipment has announced that the delay in the development of A400M aircraft will result in an additional cost of EUR 1,2-1.4 billion.
The exchange rate for EADS shares is currently EUR 21.96 after a 4% decrease.
The company was forced to review its 2007 operating result forecasts as the development of the A400M engine is delayed, which clearly led to a delay in the delivery of the aircraft.
The delay in the delivery of the combat carrier aircraft, which was announced in October, "will cost between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion will affect Airbus", announced the parent company of the European EADS manufacturing company.
Due to the emergence of these costs, EADS will have to report new design numbers for its operating results in the following Thursday, when it announces its quarterly results, the company added, but did not provide any additional figures.
The group also indicated that when preparing its new cost estimate, it took into account the six-month delay.
In 2006, EADS's operating result decreased by 86%: it was largely due to a delay in the development of another program, the A380 giant machine, which also put a high financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to transfer the A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
Status quo
There is no great surprise to the Sunday elections: the majority of the Russians will vote for the Prime Minister's Party, the United Russia.
In this, the Russians' desire for stability, to say, arbitrary governance, is evident after a highly manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, the Russian Head of State, Vladimir Putin, is speaking to voters on television via public service channels, which has already been recorded, but the content is still secret.
Putin leads the Kremlin Support Party, the candidate list of the United Russia, which is expected to be a devastating victory in the elections.
At the reception of foreign ambassadors yesterday, the Prime Minister's behaviour did not reveal anything: he made only another outburst against the interventions of the Western countries, which was a popular topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy, so we want honest, absolute transparent and open elections, without any violation," he added.
However, the opposition does not believe that this is the case at all.
The opposition condemns the campaign, which they believe has put pressure on the voters.
Gennagy Zjuganov, leader of the Communist Party, claims that "this was not a dirty choice in Russia even in the times of Jelcin".
After defeating last weekend's demonstrations, former chess champion Garri Kaszparov was sentenced to five days in prison for an unauthorized demonstration, and his lawyer claims that he is still unable to visit.
"The Russians still think of as "homo lepeticus"
The predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
- Who's following Putin in the head of state?
The official paper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, which will be 2 March 2008, and the candidates will be able to indicate their intention to leave until 23 December.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate cannot be extended any longer.
But you have no other successor on sight.
- What role does Putin play from March?
Is he gonna be a prime minister?
Or will he decide on the government and the president as the leader of the Almighty United Russia Party or the majority in Parliament?
Whatever happens, the outgoing power wins in both parliamentary and presidential elections.
It's now become a tradition.
"The Russians are still thinking of the "homo lepeticus" way: they do not feel they can control their fate," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Centre.
Nikolai Koposov, historian of the University of St. Petersburg, has gone even further: according to his theory, the country has become a cross 500 years later compared to Europe, so the development of civil society is too late.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, "Putin reached back to the Paternalist model, which was perfect for the people. Rather, because this new type of paternalism was accompanied not by intimidation, but by certain economic well-being", says Maria Lipman, a member of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "reject personal responsibility on their own", which quickly showed up after the breakup of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all parts of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of the United Russia are led by 65 governors who come from the leaders of the 85 Russian regions.
Freedom imported from the West is often a sign of chaos, as happened in the 1990s.
Public opinion favours stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extreme parties.
Tamara Cserednychenko 54-year-old teacher concludes: "Why should we think?
Those in power aren't so bad, why should we replace them?"
Depressive Memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive became public, documenting the fate of 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime.
The 47 million archives document, which occupys 27 kilometres of bolts in Bad Arolsen in Hessen Province, has so far been researchable only for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. only unique and name-specific access to the victims or their descendants of Hajdan.
In May 2006, eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, which operated the archive, agreed to open the archive to researchers and historians.
After all the States ratified the Convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen archive allows historians to carry out research on "the transfer of prisoners, the residents of camps and the health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, the director of the archive managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have objected to the disclosure of the documents, as they contain names and thus confidential information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deported victims.
The list of concentration camps and the arrest warrants issued by Gestapo began to be collected for practical reasons after the war. The aim was to search for civilians deported or sentenced to forced labour on the basis of these and possibly to provide evidence of their interning, which would give them compensation.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent workers are currently engaged in the processing of tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, part of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of outstanding importance.
"These documents are basically nothing new," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of Research Centre of Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
An EU-India Free Trade Agreement would be signed in 2008.
The turnover of intra-European bilateral trade is already close to EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the free trade agreement in 2008 - announced by European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Minister of Trade Kamal Nath in India.
The EU Foreign Ministers approved last April that the European Commission should launch negotiations on the signing of free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).Indo-European bilateral trade flows are already close to EUR 60 billion.
The EU is India's number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also India's main foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th most important trading partner, according to the Commission's figures.
Mr Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement could be economical for both parties" and "India could thus increase its presence in a flowering market with 450 million inhabitants".
The ten most important products exported by India are Europe's primary or secondary importers - the European Commissioner added. The two giants, Europe and Asia, each year, replace "a product worth EUR 47 billion" and "a service worth EUR 10 billion", said Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi this week. However, he regretted the fact that bilateral trade has "not yet reached its full potential", which is being met in New Delhi on Friday at the eighth diplomatic summit, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Reply to concerns: The Bank of England will offer £10 billion to the financial market for a five-week period
The Bank of England would like to alleviate the unrest about credit conditions, so on Thursday it announced that it would pump GBP 10 billion into the financial market, which would be available with a five-week maturity of 5,75 % and, unlike the usual one.
"We want to alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we also want banks to be able to plan their liquidity positions more safely for this period.
According to the Bank, GBP 10 billion (EUR 14 billion) will be placed on the market at 12:15 a.m. local time on 6 December.
This is the first time that the Bank of England has issued liquid funds for five weeks in the context of an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In its press release of the Bank of England, he added that "ready to take further action" in order to adapt interbank loans to the central bank base rate.
The current interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The interest rate of three months exceeded the level of 18 September: currently at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the summer money market crisis, the Bank of England has charged significant criminal interest on amounts pumped into the financial market, which has alerted banks from using them.
According to the saying (as confirmed by the development of the pound exchange rate compared to the euro), many would have been more pleased with the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which could have been obtained with a more favourable interest rate and more discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and the Nouveau Centre Group closed down the discussion of the articles of the Socialist Bill on Purchasing Power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text itself.
The text negotiated at the meeting initiated by the Socialists included about ten measures adopted by the National Office of the Socialist Party on Tuesday, including an increase of 50% in the employment allowance, the restoration of variable fuel taxes, the introduction of a travel check and the restriction of rents.
Since the UMP and the NC 180:115 voted against the examination of the articles, the discussion between the government party and the opposition at times in sharp exchanges was finally interrupted, only a few hours before President Sarkozy's television speech on purchasing power.
The Socialist Head of Delegation, Jean-Marc Ayraul, announced that he would resubmit all his group's proposals in the framework of the amendment to the draft amending financial law, which will be placed on the agenda of the Parliament next week.
A New Festival Is Born
There have been many rumors about the new Philly Music Festival to be organised by C3 Presents. However, the company that organized and promoted the event announced that the Vineland Music Festival will be held in New Jersey in cooperation with Melvin Benn’s British producer, the Festival Republic.
"It is an honor for us to work with a man who is the launcher of the American festival movement today," said Charlie Jones to Billboard.com from C3.
The C3 also organises the Lollapaloza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The New Jersey Vineland festival will be held in the summer, so it will be possible to go to the tent.
The festival will take place between 8 and 10 August in a 500-month private area located about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Melvin Benn, the director of the Festival Republic, was previously known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organisers.
In 1989 he started the British Reading Festival, which attracts around 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn further expanded his album with the organisation of the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Festival Republic brought to life the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been a co-owner in the production, licensing and organisation of the Glastonbury Festival. This festival can now accommodate up to 177 500 people.
C3's staff, Charlie Jones, the Glastonbury Festival, called it the "the most inspiring event he's ever attended. He added that his company and Melvin Benn's company are working in parallel to enrich the region with a European-style festival.
"The location in Philadelphia has already been chosen, and the Fairmount Parks Committee and I have worked hard to organise this festival in the centre of Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We have been talking with the city, and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, however, due to the political manoeuvres of the city administration, the organization has failed," said Charlie Jones.
"We were able to discuss this with Melvin Benn, and now we are preparing for a huge festival in another unique location, which will ultimately serve the interests of the people of Philadelphia."
The C3 Presents re-created the Lollapaloza festival in 2005 at Grant Park, Chicago, after demonstrating in 2002 his exceptional festival organizer talent with Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The gross income of the two events was 9.8 million and 11.3 million in 2007.
Both festivals were held at the city site.
"The European concept of Melvin Benn is based on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way, creating both a European rural atmosphere and a sense of urban life in America."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The people of Vineland, and even the mayor himself, are very much in favour of the event," says Charlie Jones.
Although he is not talking about the details of the agreement, he says that "the conditions are favourable enough to allow investment in an event of this size at a site that hopefully will give the festival a home for a long time".
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be of "great" size, with a capacity of approximately 80 000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
The bands have already received the invitation to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
"Vineland is basically going to be a rock festival, but we're planning a variety of musical offers so that everyone can find something to please it," says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Att, together form the C3 company, which received the "best independent event organiser" award from the latest Billboard Touring Award.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to deal with the Terminator...
"Treaty" is one of the tasks of the Montreal delegation.
The mission promises to be "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is opposed to filming his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight the Terminator Governor?
"We need to be careful, because the film industry decides which is the best place for it.
If you find the conditions in Montreal favourable, you'll go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions on which we will be decided," says Schwarzenegger.
Comparison for the Festivals
Now, however, Denis Turcotte focuses most on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for Oscars started.
The aim is to present and promote as many Quebec films as possible at every American film festival, be it the Sundance Film Festival or the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
The film L'Âge des ténèbres received a favourable reception a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, the Palm Springs International Festival will also be planned.
The shake Hands with the Devil will also be presented in Santa Monica and in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
Quebec also represented itself with four short films and four play films this month at the American Film Institute Fest event.
Will there be a race at the end of the year on the stock market? Experts will share the opinion of the "subprime" crisis
Just five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already rubbed their hands and are looking forward to the end of the usual year.
This year, however, it is not clear to the experts whether this is really going to happen.
According to Banif, "from a statistical point of view, the stock exchange generally behaves positively in December.
However, only statistical forecasts are not necessarily correct, and even in the current situation the market is characterised by uncertainty, at least in the short term".
The experts do not support the fact that the stock exchange will last at the end of the year, although they state that "the stock market will be maintained by the presence of liquidity, this will provide an opportunity for investment, as there are no alternatives to the guarantee, especially the fixed yield, which is negatively affected by the escape to quality securities, both in the long term and in the short term".
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will be characterised by a lateral movement, free of volatility, "in particular, as the effect of the FED interest rate reduction is currently unknown, the price of crude oil is high and inflationary tensions are also threatened".
Javier Barrio, sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees with this, which means it would be risky to state that there will be a rally.
The expert says "it's not a rose at all."
The loss of Ibex is approximately 4 per cent compared to the highest values recorded on 8 November when the index was closed at 15.945,7.
Nevertheless, not all experts are so gruesome.
According to Juan Solana, Intermoney's analyst, Ibex 35 can close the year closer to 16,000 points due to the restructuring of wallets and the payments to the usual pension fund.
On the other hand, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year, as the rally moves to the second week of December, after the long weekend of the Constitution holiday.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
Federico Olucha, Analyst of Inversis Banco, says that we are close to the technical level and that "there are some cases of a decline in the stock exchange index, which may rise depending on the news from the US, as regards the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst is confident that these will be beneficial.
Analysts agree on what will be the securities to reach Ibex's new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, stresses that "this year it's time for big securities."
The expert would put the two large banks and some construction companies on the list, "because by then the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha claims from Inversis Banco that the increase is due to the banking sector and industry.
For construction companies, the rally can also be positive, if any.
"ACS has been trying to regain its positions for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow this path," says the expert.
cyclical consumption will be the main player in the rest of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sale period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also benefit, although the presence on the Spanish market is not too high in this area.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, there have only been a two-time fall in the December exchange rate.
The real year-end rally was observed in 2003 when the stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the outbreak of technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 corrected 28.17 percent, a 6,68% jump was registered in December.
So it is still open whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profitable year (the Ibex shows an increase of 8.36% since January) and whether the final rally can take place.
Banco Popular Español opens an account open from Monday to Saturday for 12 hours
Banco Popular Español decided to renovate most of its accounts.
This concerns a total of 200 branches in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the name Popular Max and bring a big change to the bank.
However, for the other Spanish institutions too, this is the first group whose accounts are kept continuously open from 10 p.m. to 20:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The other group, BBVA, which has also stated several times that it plans to open its accounts, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
But he's just about to make a deal with the unions that he's closing 75% of his accounts in exchange for an afternoon, although not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for the other institutions, as it will be the basis for deciding whether to join the initiative to promote more favourable opening-up of businesses.
This is precisely the objective of the Banco Popular Español project.
I would like to target shopping individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local businesses in these places.
The Bank would like to operate 200 branches throughout Spain for 18 months with the above mentioned opening, because it is not a new opening order, but an existing transformation.
To this end, the institution will modernise its branches in commercial zones according to the needs of the customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening time is accompanied by a new thought of the nature of the drawers, a more modern, colourful design.
Angel Rivera, who is responsible for commercial banks, points out that there is no need for a large investment to be restructured, but they need to employ more employees, which means eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
Accounts in which even small and medium-sized negotiators can be found will not sell financial products.
Favorable Experience
In the three Madrid branches of Banco Popular Español, the initiative was already implemented.
Ángel Rivero said the experiences were positive.
The accounts in the streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid were selected, and Rivero said that the decision was correct.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2.500 accounts.
More 60 works under the name Mundocredit, specializes in immigrants, and also has a very favourable opening order, even on Sundays and holidays.
In the units mentioned in PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used, where some accounts offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our clients," points out Rivero.
At the moment, Telefonica has been able to reach agreement and sell mobile phones using external personnel.
Telecinco doubles its rival Antena 3 stock exchange value for the first time
"We did it."
With this sentence, Paolo Vasile, the expert consultant of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the market yesterday when it turned out that the television company he was driving doubled the value of Antena 3.
But one thing clouded his joy: "It only hurts that this is not because we have risen more, but because we have fallen less," he said.
He has still placed great emphasis on the fact that in the weak market we have "less".
Telecinco closed yesterday with an increase of 2.54 percent.
This increase puts annual losses at 15.66 percent.
52 per cent of the company is Mediaset, 13 per cent is Vocento, so the stock exchange value according to Bloomberg is EUR 4.488.88 million.
His rival, Antena, lost 1.52 percent yesterday and has been accounting for 40,5 percent since January, so yesterday it was half, 2,193,46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies is 3.571 million for Sogecable; 2.518,53 million for Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the similarity between the two companies.
The only question is how much we can achieve in the same market, at what costs and how all this is going to be recovered in terms of views.
Last week Telecinco announced that this year he wanted to be the first TV channel to be more than 1 billion gross advertising revenues, said Giuseppe Tringali, Adviser to Telecinco and Publiespaña, a subsidiary of the group.
If the notified fact is achieved, compared to 965.4 million recorded in the financial year 2006, the TV channel would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6 percent in this financial year.
The net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the financial year ( thus reaching 734.4 million), while the net turnover of television increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
According to the analysts, one factor that triggers Telecinco's stock market momentum is the high payout held so far: in 2006, 100% of the profits of the company led by President Alejandro Echevarría were distributed among its shareholders.
According to Vasile, although it is too early to decide, this rate may change after taking 33% of Endemol with its parent company, the Mediaset.
"We guarantee the minimum 50% payment in public, although we have always distributed much more.
I hope our shareholders will be pleased this year because we have already benefited from the acquisition of 33 percent of Endemol."
According to the analysts, the market is currently characterised by some fallout.
Lehman Brothers has recently reduced its profit estimates for Telecinco by 4 % in 2008 and 7 % in 2009.
According to them, this is due to the expected increase in turnover in 2008 from 10,5 per cent to 8,4 per cent and from 5,5 per cent in 2009 to 5,1 per cent.
According to the same company’s forecasts, Antena’s 3 profits will fall by 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7,5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: proposes the purchase of both securities, mainly due to the high rentability of dividends and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: you consider Telecinco more favourable (purchase) than Antena 3 (holding) because of its "multiplicity" and business strengthening.
3.
JPMorgan: in both cases underweight is proposed due to "comparative risks" (a saturated market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves the adoption of MiFID, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel to the parliamentary session - which ended today with the Congress vote approving the Senate's amendments - the government has initiated a social dialogue on the legislation on which the law is based, so that both can enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts of Members and Senators in negotiations and agreements aimed at developing the most favourable norms for investors and detailed regulation of the activities of companies in order to ensure efficient market functioning.
Mifid, which amends the Securities and Markets Act, allows for the modernisation of financial markets while at the same time strengthening the protection of investors, extending the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities and Markets Committee (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new directive allows financial advisory services for specialised companies, but also for natural or legal persons, as well as for securities trading companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies to create a new form of financial service (ESS), namely financial advisory companies (AFI).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems suitable for the execution of operations concerning funds, thereby adding to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading platforms and internalisation systems for the execution of orders which compete with current stock exchanges operators.
In addition, the Act obliges investment firms to provide market information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk-taking and risk-management methods, as well as to keep records of all operations carried out in order to facilitate the monitoring of CNMV.
The Economic Commission for Congress has introduced a number of amendments, of which it is of paramount importance that the securitisation debt is treated as a "complex" financial instrument, because of the high risk to the investor, which has been established in connection with the US high-risk mortgage credit (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive has been used to legally outline the scope of activities of economic and business graduates, 30 years after the entry into force in 1977 of the Royal Decree on Professional Functions, which can only be performed by economists.
In addition, the Senate proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as its intermediary agent, who works for another account, does not need a CNMV licence and can market products or acquire customers for several investors at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November and reached 4.1%.
This indicator, which is taken into account by Eurostat for the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for the month of November.
Its disclosure is consistent with the strategy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank to provide data that can be compared with data from the United States, both in terms of the time and nature of their creation.
The same calculation method is used for the preliminary indicator as for the calculation of the Harmonised Index of Prices, but the statistical modelling method differs to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Statistical Office stressed that the preliminary indicator was purely indicative and could therefore differ from the final data which would be published on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price Index continues to show a relatively high value."
Pedro Solbes, a Vice-President of the Government and Minister for Economic Affairs, stated that the rise in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November was only "temporary", but also predicted that the price index would show a "relatively high" value in the coming months.
In the corridors of Parliament, Solbes confirmed that "although the indicator is not really favourable", the inflation rate in Spain has remained more or less the same within the monetary union in recent years.
He also added that the month of November "bringed less surprise" than the month before when the government did not count for such a great increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%" was recognised by the Minister of Economic Affairs in relation to the data disclosed today.

Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% and currently only GBP 12 billion (EUR 16 billion 800 million) has been in crisis since mid-September and had to borrow urgent loans from the National Bank of England.
At the time, he had a record deposit of more than GBP 25 billion, which gradually decreased over the last two and a half months due to the loss of trust of customers, despite the government's promise of a 100% guarantee to the bank until the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial, commercial name, Virgin Money. Virgin will have to make up about a quarter of British bank revenues in the next three years in order to obtain the remaining £18 billion and thus achieve the 30 billion target.
Richard Branson, a prominent businessman who has become known for his promotional campaigns in England, has the intention of spending some 50 million pounds (EUR 70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve the stated goal.
Northern Rock this week highlighted the offer of the Virgin consortium as the most favourable to avoid bankruptcy. Besides Virgin, three other companies form the consortium.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for a alleged corruption case.
At dawn today, the silent guard arrested the mayor of Totana, a town in Murcia province, because he is suspected of being involved in the urban corruption scandal that has erupted this week.
In addition, a secretary from City Hall and the local police chief were arrested.
The former member of the City Council, José Martínez Andreo, took the place of the People's Party Congressman Juan Morales in May, who, according to the official bodies consulted by the SER radio channel, was the head of the corruption network.
The police continue to investigate the city's offices and the City Council, and it cannot be excluded that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' lawyer has been investigated as the main suspect in the corruption scandal that took place this week.
According to SER's radio feed, Juan Morales' attorney was arrested when he left Morales with the corruption file in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission that Morales received in exchange for signing a city development agreement with a Galicia construction company about 200 hectares of land reclassification.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Mr Bono accepts the nomination of the PSOE in Toledo and his parliamentary presidency if the elections are won.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, accepted the offer of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, to run the PSOE list in the forthcoming parliamentary elections and to fill the parliamentary office if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced at a press conference by the PSOE Secretary, José Blanci, and Bono himself confirmed the party in the federal center today at noon after a meeting with Zapatero.
The Prime Minister justified his election to the former Minister as "we have to count on the best" in politics, and Bono as "the best".
In addition, he added that "likely" a Mancha politician will be the candidate for the Socialist Party's presidential office in Parliament if the Socialists win in the forthcoming elections.
Bono would take over the place of the current parliamentary president, Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he would not intend to start in the next elections and give up his political career, rather in scientific circles, then fight against climate change.
The former Minister has acknowledged that the Prime Minister has constantly taken the initiative to return to the political scene since he left active politics two years ago.
He also added that, since the voters are aware of who will be the vice-president of the economy in the event of the Socialists' victory, the party would also like to inform them of who will be the President of Parliament in the light of 'transparency'.
If Bono is really going to fill the post, he would like Parliament to be "the scene of respect and not insulting or yelling" and to be more like the home of citizens.
"Unfortunately, at times, Parliament seems to be the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to speak peacefully, but it has happened that the Prime Minister's speech has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate."
At the same time, he praised the current president, Manuel Marín, for his "excellent work", but he did not want to present himself as president already, so that his opponents did not consider him to be a "supervisor".
A campaign for climate change
Since the climate change movement is ruthlessly pursuing both those who are sceptical about their forecasts and those who prefer political or social battles, they must be very strong.
In fact, it must also be accompanied by a political leader such as the Prime Minister Zapatero, who says that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and declares that 'we must enter into a new agreement with our Earth'.
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its government has contributed to the non-compliance of Spain with the Kyoto Convention within the Union.
Who are responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is affected and why did the Government not seek to avoid it?
In addition, Spain should clearly explain what measures it intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, which practices must be changed by the population, what individual and social energy savings must be expected and what economic consequences will this have?
So who needs to make sacrifices and who needs to pay to save our Earth?
But we didn't get it, and we're not gonna get an explanation for these questions.
Exactly because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate change has taken measures, actual measures are always unpopular.
They are cost-effective, uncomfortable and cost-effective for both companies and the population.
Even the increase in the PSOE fuel price would have been so unpopular before the elections that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
That is, we have to save the Earth from nothing, simply propaganda, empty passwords without real consequences.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With the agreement with Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so nicely in the election campaign, does not demand, attack, even decorate the election meetings and wakes us up with tenderness.

The mayor of Totana and the chief of police were arrested for a alleged corruption case.
The Silence Guard arrested the mayor of Totana, Murcai Province, and Andreot José Martínez of the People's Party, the local police chief, the secretary of the City Hall and a catering contractor for crimes related to urban development, today were informed by police sources.
The mayor was arrested in his home and then transferred to the City Hall, and is still present with several police officers, many of whom are investigating at the City Council and the municipal bodies responsible for the management of industrial sites and housing.
The three arrests were preceded by the arrest of six persons in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia last Monday in a case in which 2 hectares of agricultural land were converted into a building block in order to allow the construction of 4000 apartments for Galicia's Nuaria company after having been paid a reward to managers in an unlawful manner during their previous mandate.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation, according to the information of the Totanian Court of Justice No. 1.
The first six arrested were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, the former mayor of Totana, Juan Morales, who today is an independent representative of the People's Party, is also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who is the owner of a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also being investigated, as is the current friend of the former mayor, who lives in the middle of Murcia Province.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A., and the entrepreneur were arrested in Nigrán (Pottevedra), together with the director of the Suelo de Inmonuar company Pablo José M.G. The latter company belongs to the Nuaria Group and has committed the bribes through it.
The investigation shall be conducted by a group of the Operational Central Unit of the Silence Guard for crimes committed at municipal level, whose members carried out 11 search warrants other than arrests, in particular in relation to the arrestees, operating in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, one person was arrested: the owner of a company with well-known poultry products in the area who could play a mediating role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in Totana, where 5000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels would have been built.
The company has acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which has been reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the population currently with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, Preconiza, which specialises in the management of the parking lot of Coruna, Venezuelan streets and the Catholic Ferdinand Square, and Preconiza, which specialises in direct marketing, and the sale, promotion and installation of building elements in Vigo.

If they agree, we will put aside a little bit of the monthly book and see if we can acquire some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I'm already equipped with one.
People, life is a constant change.
Of course, everyone can figure something out.

Our Finnish reporter found this comment in one of Finland's largest daily newspapers: (although at the head of the PISA report on the world's culture level), in Helsingin Sanomat, referring to what was published on 18 November with criticism of Blackburn's book.
"The philosophic teachings came before the public after the tragedy of Jokela High School.
The killer quoted Plato's and Nietzsche's writings in messages from a pre-school student.
On the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper, Pekka Elo, who was charged with teaching philosophy, demanded that teachers look at Plato's teachings with a critical eye and added that Nietzsche's knowledge is not necessarily important in the compulsory basic philosophy of secondary schools."

One of your colleagues informs us that the Penal Code contains an offence relating to Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song is a crime and can be punished for a year from six months to a year.
However, if you steal a record of less than 400 euros in a store, it is only a violation of the rules (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal 1000 euros in a store, theft is already a crime, but its punishment still does not reach the level of punishment that can be imposed on the Internet download (Article 234 BTK).
C. If you steal a car, but return it in 40 hours, the penalty still does not reach the level of the penalty that can be imposed when you download the Internet (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect less punishment if you get involved in a fight than if you copy CDs.
If you are involved in a mass fight, you can receive a penalty ranging from three months to one year (Article 154 BTK), while a penalty ranging from six months to two years for copying the CD.
(Art. 270 BTK).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected films is more punishable without the consent of the authors than the sale of pornography material to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague's right, someone's really out of control.

My home doctor gave me an article on weird research called "Money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less."
So the feelings of the workers on the payday depend on how much the others received.
The experiment was conducted at the University of Bonn by measuring the tomograph of magnetic resonances, and the results were also published in the latest number of science.
The author of the study and the leader of the neurocognition group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, Bernd Weber, said: "We measured the strongest activity when the participant correctly responded and his partner made a mistake".
Researchers found that if they both gave the right answer and received the same amount of money, brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received a double dose, activity was increased.
I have no idea why such a great science needed such a simple compromise.
Prosecutor General of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been ruthlessly pursuing the Balkan war crimes in the Hague and the Criminal Tribunal for Crimes in the Former Yugoslavia.
His mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a slightly bitter taste of mouth, as he is responsible for the srebrenica massacre, during which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were massacred, namely General Ratko Mladic and Serbian Bosnian leader Radován Karajics are still on the loose.
Their names are on the list chosen by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as his documentary film: Carla's list (not yet presented in Spain 2006). As with real crime, the film follows the Swiss Attorney General's work from Belgrade to New York as he tries to put pressure on the governments involved to need a loop around the escaped sinners.
What kind of insurance does it look like to me?
Car insurance, which means that the owner of the car has a significant cost and depends on several factors such as age, gender, the date of acquisition of the licence, family status, the type and nature of use of the car to be insured.
Getting the car is just a first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding which car we want.
First of all, we need to be aware of what this is about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured person.
This agreement is a body in the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company undertakes compensation in the event of the occurrence of the damage in the event of a fixed premium.
The insurance premium is practically the amount paid for insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors such as age, gender, the date of acquisition of the licence, family status, type of car to be insured, its use and so on.
Insurance companies determine the insurance premium on the basis of statistics, i.e. pay a higher amount for the person who represents a higher accident risk.
This is why women are over 25 years of age or pay less, because statistics show that they pose a lower risk because they are more cautious.
Similarly, on the basis of the findings, insurance companies have come to the conclusion that married people cause less accidents than lonely people.
The frequency for the type of car is the final one.
More frequent use increases the possibility of an accident.
Insurance companies take a number of factors into account when determining the premium.
The owner must therefore carefully examine the best form of insurance for his or her profile.
The following are the most important factors for choosing to best adapt to the needs of the insured and to set an acceptable price.
When concluding an insurance contract, under 25 years olds have to deal with a number of disadvantages, such as lack of experience in driving and freshness of the licence.
Although the most ideal thing to do is to ensure that we are safe against all dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
More careful leaders can make complete insurance with themselves, thus being secured against all dangers, and the price will be affordable.
In such a type of contract, the insured person pays part of the damage.
"The amount of self-payment by the insured depends on the insurance premium; the higher the premium, the lower the self-payment," says Luis Noguera, Spain's head of First Europa, the Internet Insurance Mediator.
Another option is liability insurance extended to third parties when the customer provides himself against the damage caused to others, but not against the damage caused in his own car.
Besides, you'll be secured against theft, fire and the loss of the car.
Good advice.
If you are not 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents, because this has an impact on the bonus, so you can reduce the amount to be paid in the future.
A bonus is called a bonus in relation to the premium of the insurance company.
The penalty imposed against the basic tariff is called raspberry.
"The size of the bonus and the raspberry depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company had a good year, you can afford to raise the bonus" explains Noguera.
Once the age of 25 has been exceeded, it is easier for owners to provide adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced due to the experience gained over the years.
Then we advise you to make a full insurance policy.
"In general, young people are not yet able to properly apply their experience in any accident or even when driving," says the Spanish director of the European insurance company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of management when the leaders have already gone beyond the fears of the beginners.
If the insured is already married but has no children yet, it is best to make complete insurance, of course, if your financial options allow this.
Insurance companies consider married couples with children to be the lowest risk clients, so in their case the fee to be paid is also lower.
In this case, the best complete insurance is self-insurance (which can reach EUR 300), or if they have a higher bonus, the insurance can be extended from the third year of the vehicle to the damage caused to others.
"They drive more calmly, but at the same time they have greater purchasing power and can afford to have higher self-sufficientness", confirms Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, complete insurance can be extended to liability insurance with a self-preservation (around EUR 150) or higher bonus.
Car insurance is a very important thing, not only because it is a protection for the owner in the event of damage, but also because it is a high cost, so it is essential that we select the personalised form of insurance properly.
Celtic wants to score in Milan to get into the eighth final.
Milan and Celtic will measure their power at the San Siro Stadium on Tuesday to get the missing point when the Champions League closes, so the Italians can be first, and the Scottishs can qualify.
The Italians have a total of ten points, and in the fifth round they have already secured progress with a tie with Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but it would need another one so that the six-point Shakhtar, who will fight the four-point Benfica, does not prevent it.
The D Group's two games will be held one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan will have to play at the Club World Cup in Japan, where on 13th, it will try to fight the finals for the 16th final.
With this, Group D will close sooner than the others, and although the most likely result in the Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be the final, the two teams will seek victory, as the Italians do not want to be left behind at home, and the Celtic will be the first to take a better place in the eighth final.
Even the defeat of Gordon Strachan's team is enough to qualify for it if Shakhtar does not win, but it is not certain, because if there is an equality, the Ukrainians will be able to continue, who lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but won the next battle (2-0).
The Italians will try to make the evening of the Scots desperate, who would like to be in the eighth finale of the League of Reorganised Champions twice in a row, after having scored a goal from Kaka in an extension after 0-0 finals (1-0) in the previous season.
The Shakhtar would be most happy to win the Rossonerik victory, because if the Celtic gets into the eighth finals and stays in UEFA.
Since Benfica, despite being in the final position and impossible to stay in the European Championship, can still get a third place with a win to play with in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
He started his tour at the Spice Girls Vancouver (Canada), and they performed for the first time before 20,000 viewers since they were disbanded in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Geri Halliwell" were announced a few minutes before the concert held in Vancouver GM Place that the band is in the form of "remeres".
Some 20,000 people changed tickets to be there at the concert, where a video film was also presented about the history of the band that won huge success in the 1990s.
At the same time as the reuniting of the band and the tour, the EMI has launched a new album in Spain, with the larger hits and two new songs "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five members of the Spice Girls went on stage in a bracelet from the husband of "Posh Spice", British football player David Beckham.
The athlete was also there on the ground of the GM Place, although Victoria banned him a few days earlier.
When the show belled in, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "has never seen our costumes, so I'm nervous about what she'll think of the show".
'Sporty Spice' was the reason that the band broke up two years after leaving the band in 1998 'because the members didn't understand each other'. He also seemed nervous during the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the people's feelings for the Spice Girls changed.
I thought, "Why not?" Now I'm glad I decided," said Chisholm about the band that broke up nine years earlier because of it.
The singer also added that during the time "things were arranged and we love each other very much".
But there's a lot of things that's changed since the "Space Girls" last played in 1998.
According to CTV's television reports, Virginia Airlines arrived on a special plane to the joint Vancouver.
There was a bunch of baby-sitters waiting at the airport.
Five of them have seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the team will perform in California (USA) and then in San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will perform on 23 December in Madrid.
Another fear of the Russian-Ukraine gas debate
The gas auction between Ukraine and Russia has been renewed, which could also affect Russian fuel to be delivered to Western Europe.
The vast majority of Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transferred through Ukraine and discussions between the two nations are always closely monitored.
Kiev stated that if Moscow increases the price of gas paid by the Ukrainians, they would also be suffering Russia at higher transit costs.
As a result of an earlier debate between the two countries last year, supplies to EU countries decreased.
The most recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is the state-owned gas monopoly of the Ukrainian Government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, which is the subject of an agreement on the price of gas to be paid by Ukraine to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom stated that the gas produced from neighbouring Turkmenistan should be increased by 50% compared to the price agreement with Ukraine in 2008.
According to the analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of the shipment from Gazprom to Ukraine.
"It is important that we argue during the negotiations in accordance with one of the most important transit countries for natural gas," said the Ukrainian Minister for Economic Affairs Anatoliy Kinah to the Reuters News Agency.
"The changes in gas prices should definitely be linked to the debate on the level of costs of transits across Ukraine (and to Western Europe)."
As a result of the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom blocked the gas station to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has resulted in a domino-like decrease in exports to Western Europe, which has increased prices to a large extent.
A quarter of the European Union's gas supply is made up of Russian gas.
Russia has the largest reserves of natural gas in the world, but most of them are still unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom will complement its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet countries in Central Asia.
The NHS "must check foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS Committees should improve the control of the criminal records of workers from outside Europe, said a supervisory body.
The proposal was presented by Robert Black’s main auditor after a foreign doctor in Scotland was associated with an attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland does not have precise data on the number of employees overseas.
At the same time, it pointed out in its report, through a model of five health authorities, key controls that were properly carried out.
After the attack on Glasgow airport, the main auditor checked the list of staff recruited outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old Bilal Abdullah, a doctor from the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, Iraq, was arrested at the airport after a jeep hit the main building.
Abdullah was one of the three doctors who were questioned by the Old Bailey Court in October on charges of attempted car bombings in the United Kingdom.
In the case of employees from overseas countries, the NHS Committees shall, before starting employment, verify the existence of the qualifications and working experience of the workers concerned and their provision with the authorisations necessary for their employment in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Committees apply Discosure Scotland to ensure the verification of criminal records, the Agency shall not be entitled to obtain such information from outside the territory of the United Kingdom.
The main auditor's report suggested, inter alia, that the committees should introduce a guide from the Crime Registry Office, which will facilitate control processes with different overseas countries for the employer.
"Although we have found evidence of such checks in the records of personnel, they are not carried out regularly," says the report.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS performs its own pre-employment screening process at a high level, adding: "Our report highlights the development areas of the system in order to provide up-to-date information on the number of staff from the NHS overseas".
Dr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, said that it is "very improbable" to identify potential NHS employees who can commit terrorist acts in the future through pre-employment checks.
"The report states that the pre-employment checks currently used work well in NHS Scotland and that the value of the proposals has not yet been transparent".
According to the Scottish health authorities, the current number of doctors and nurses is 11,61.
However, the main auditor pointed out that the figures are likely to be higher, partly due to the fact that the Commission has a problem with the identification of staff on leave for an indefinite period of time.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures in the Ayrshire and Arran areas, the Grampin, the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, the Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian operate in a high degree of coordination.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, work permits and evidence of formal qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the directive and guidance on pre-employment checks for employees from the NHS overseas countries.
Nicola Sturgeon, Health Secretary, said: "I was very pleased to see that this task was accomplished after the attack on Glasgow Airport.
In addition, he added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take into account the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that the updated guide on pre-employment checks for the entire staff, including those from overseas, reflects the best practice.
The Joy Division tarts at the film prize distribution
A bipic made of Joy Division's late singer, Ian Curtis, the "Control", swept five prizes at the British Independent Film Awards, among other things, for the best film.
The main character, Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before Curtis was played, and Anton Corbijn was a director and Toby Kebbell was a co-star.
The best actress's award was won by Dame Judi Dench with the Thriller "A Story Details".
And the Variety Prize was taken by Daniel Craig, who made the Bond.
The prizes were awarded during the ceremony at Roundhouse, London.
The film "Control" presents Curtis's rise in Joy Division's berks until 1980, when he committed suicide when he was 23 years old.
The production of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order on the soundtrack also cost only £3 million.
The Dutch photographer Corbijn, who was previously known as the album cover of the U2 "Joshua Tree", was rich in two prizes; the best director and the best beginner's prize.
Another prize winner of the festival placed rock music at the centre; Julien Temple Joe Strummer's film about Clash's singer took the prize for the best documentary film.
Viggo Mortensen was awarded the best actor's prize for his performance as a driver of the London-based Thriller of the Mafia leader of the "Crying Promises" by David Cronenberg.
Ray Winstone received Richard Harris for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The fifty-year-old actor, whose names include the films "Scum", "Ehkopon" and "Sexy Dog", is currently involved in the film "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal.
Winstone is proud to take over the award for "Camelot" and "Harry Potter", a star named Harris, who died in 2002.
"For people like me, people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened a gate," said Winstone.
"I feel really lucky to have met Richard Harris several times.
Richard Harris' style is close to me, he was a great actor of his age, and I appreciate him very much."
The selection of independent film prizes known as Bifa is decided by a group of film directors, actors and festival organisers.
Among Bifa's supporters and patrons are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal, and Michael Winterbotom.
208 people have been arrested in Saudi Arabia for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that 208 militants involved in terrorist cells were arrested, who were planning to carry out an imminent attack on an oil installation and a series of attacks on church people and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda's supporters launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been working as an ally of the United States since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
According to television reports, an eight-person cell led by a foreign resident is intended to launch an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province.
After the attempted attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq, organised by Al-Qaeda, Saudi Arabia began building a 35,000-person rapid reaction force to protect the facilities.
According to the report referring to the words of the Minister of Home Affairs, 18 of the detainees belong to a cell led by a person "specialized in missiles" who illegally crosses the border.
The report also reported that the warriors attempted to smuggle eight bullets into the realm of the kingdom.
22 of the detainees were planning to assassinate church leaders and security forces.
The government called for tougher action to be taken by the church leaders to contain Saudis joining the Al-Qaida fighters, who are fighting against the Allied Forces and the Chinese government with American support.
The fighters of Al-Qaida view a significant part of the leaders of the Saudi Arabian Church as being involved by the authorities in the policy of the royal family that governs the government.
The fighters of the organization - encouraged by the call of the Saudi leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, for the purpose of the Western-friendly Saudi government - were targeted at the attack on settlements, government buildings and energy facilities of foreign residents.
"The security forces have made enormous efforts in the past five months," said a Home Office spokesperson to state television.
During the arrests in Medina, a 16-person "media cell" was also captured, aimed at spreading "takfiri thinking". Takfiri thinking is the ideology of the Sunnita Muslim radicals, which supports the violent action against the unfaithful and disbelief-stampled Muslims.
Among those arrested were 32 persons who were accused of financial support from the militia.
The climate in Venus can provide an insight into the future of the Earth
According to scientists yesterday, Venus could once provide a pleasant living environment.
Data from a European orbiting spaceship suggest that this planet is more regarded as the earth's whimsical twin brother than we thought before.
Venus is the nearest Planetary of the Earth.
The size of the two planets is almost the same and their orbit is similar, although Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists today learned that several billion years ago, Venus could have had a very similar life - conditions to Earth and even a habitable environment.
However, because of the high carbon dioxide-glass effect of the jump, the atmospheric erosion caused by the solar radiation and the lower speed of rotation of the planet, Venus has entered a vastly different path of development.
Today, water has evaporated from the planet, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and hurricane winds and lightning storms destroy it.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express space probe - based on a study of the planet for a year - are a striking picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes can take place on Earth.
Fred Taylor, professor of physics at Oxford University, who is also one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "Get to know why the climate in Venus is so different from that on Earth, despite the fact that the two planets have a very similar structure.
"Our new data enabled us to develop a scenario of the formation of Venus billions of years ago, when it could still have living conditions similar to Earth.
Police-occupied "enriched uranium"
One kilo of radioactive material - uranium enriched according to reports - was seized yesterday by the Slovaks and the Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesperson, three people were arrested and the material was tested.
The spokesperson did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but stated that the material could have been sold for $1 million (480 000).
Open doors open
Mitt Romney says he's not worthy of a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
However, the Republican candidates for the presidential election agreed to take part in a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and forwarded them to candidates.
None of the issues that were submitted on Wednesday night on 28 November proved as ridiculous as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in his debate on YouTube.
However, this time the questions and answers well reflected the situation of the Republican Party approaching next year's election.
For the time being, it is not known how the CNN manufacturing leaders who co-finance the debate selected the YouTube clips submitted to the candidates.
The longest issue of the first half of the debate was immigration.
This topic is one of the Republicans' copper parrots.
CNN has asked some uncertain voters to dial a number if it sounds like something to them: the intermediary experienced outstanding agreement when the candidates made a strong statement on the question of borders.
The most lively and longest debate has taken place between Rudy Giuliani at national level and Romney, who has been the leader in the decisive pre-elections held in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the image of him that during his mayorship in New York, he was too easy to deal with the issue of illegal immigration.
You accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build your house by the former Massachusetts governor.
The battle between them became particularly acute when the questioners were interested in supporting "amnestia" (which would provide illegal immigrants with permanent status and citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as the California and Tom Tancredo Colorados, have managed to get a lot deeper into the subject.
And although none of them are likely to be on the mark, perhaps their stay on the racetrack is explained by the fact that they started to ring the bells ringing immigration loudly and loudly before the others.
At least there is broad consensus amongst candidates on immigration: a common goal is to strengthen borders and to act hard against illegal immigrants.
This subject, like the fear of Chinese toxic games and other disturbing factors from the outside world, will help the Republicans to forget or minimize the division between the liberals and the Christian conservatives.
However, when topics of a different nature were brought to the fore, the debate was very unpleasant.
Giuliani had to face up to the question of why he used to support gun control.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated water-strapping should be considered torture.
Another questioner wondered whether the candidates believed all the Bible’s words.
In this matter, Giuliani stumbled on the point of view that although he considered the Bible to be his favorite book, Jonah and the whale might not be able to understand literally.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who has just won the first election in Iowa, reacted to the expectations that the death penalty was painful, but needed.
When asked whether Jesus would receive sufficient support, he laughed that Jesus was wiser than to start in the elections.
Competition remains unusually open.
Huckabee's Iowa boost coincides with the liberal Ron Paul's fund-raising campaign and the enthusiastic cheer of Wednesday's debate.
The sudden break-up of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet managed to launch a joint candidate among the more well-known and traditional aspirinns.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who was in a timely and convincing race with the victory message of America's greatness, and who found a common voice with both wings of the party.
Now, however, the party is divided, and the consequences are still unforeseeable.
Labour-related pains
Another gap in front of Gordon Brown; the way out is unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, the current situation does not seem too cumbersome.
No one sold their honor, no politicians came up with their hotel accounts in Paris, no one committed an out-of- wedlock scandal.
However, to discover that a rich businessman under the name of others for more than four years has contributed to the High Britain Labour Party with an amount of more than GBP 650 000 ($1.3 million) and that this party has not reported, one of the things without which the circumcised Gordon Brown would have been well gained.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister got away with the election, and when his statement - that public opinion polls did not influence the outcome of the decision - unthinkably questioned the British's intellectual ability, people were still hoping that Brown would provide a strong and effective governance.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the vice-president of the Liberal Democrats, who made increasingly funny remarks, has now turned from feared Brown Stalin to Mr Bean.
The negative move to rescue Northern Rock has put regulatory weaknesses and shortcomings in judgment in a crossfire.
Patient proposals to change the tax law have encouraged business stakeholders to come together with the government.
The loss of 25 million people's personal data by the tax authorities has revealed an unimaginably high level of maladministration.
In the House of Lords, three retired generals protesting to reduce the military budget, saying that the defence minister's position was part-time.
And now here are the mysterious donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, secretary-general of the Labour Party (previously administrative leader) has already resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the way out.
At the same time, governments can reach the point where governance is impossible.
People don't like politicians and don't trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually stop their disbelief.
However, as it becomes clear that the Prime Minister is very likely not to be able to bring things forward, and perhaps he will not remain on his post for a long time, the suspended infidelity will end: the civil servants' arm will start leaking, the cabinet ministers will look for guidance, the press will look for bad-taste news; and the government will begin to defend itself and will be unable to concentrate.
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult situation, because unlike other political leaders, he does not count as "fresh blood".
As much as he'd like to deny his relationship with Tony Blair, he was still his right-hand man.
The problems surrounding Northern Rock and the tax records relate, for example, to decisions taken during the Brown Finance Ministry.
And while Blair's misdemeanors - such as the "noble for money" issue and the protracted examination of the relationship between political party funding - were not directly involved, voters can rightly assume the opposite.
Although Brown's situation is really uncomfortable, it's not as embarrassing as it looks.
The shootings that have been committed are not as scary as they are indicated by their throats.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was taken directly.
And compensation, however painful it is, can be the creation of the trends that Stalin, who lives in Brown, has always promised: reliable, solid and slightly hard-handed governance.
For example, the coolness of political donation serves.
The Garboian imaginative Abrahams, who likened his donation to charity, declared that he did not want to make his good deed public.
Perhaps so, but making a decision was not his responsibility.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of large political supporters is clear and purely justified: the population has the right to know who knocks at the gates of the country's leaders.
Watt, who, according to his own words, knew about Abrahams' actions, was not aware of its illegal nature, would certainly be sweating during the interrogations; just like Jon Medleson, the founder of the Labour Party, who was informed of the confusion of donations in October.
But Brown, for the time being, is not led by the wires: there is no indication that he knew about these coils, not even that the huge sums were paid after he entered Brown's office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of his job.
Although he quickly condemned the violation of the law by his party, he diluted his strength by reaching out to a familiar device; by examining the case, for safety reasons, he commissioned a committee under the leadership of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this story, "learning to learn" is not too complicated.
In the event of an offence, the police are in charge.
In addition, Brown needs to take care of other issues, such as the appointment of an independent committee to discuss administrative rules without leadership for six months or the prioritisation of effective reform of political party funding.
This would require the hard hat Labour Party to cooperate with the Tori and to break up with special financial relations with the associations - that would be a tough wall for the party Brown.
But you should face some of the facts about the party.
According to surveys, conservatives currently lead to a serious advantage; Brown has two years to reinstate the voters behind him; the only way to win is to be impeccable integrity and strong competence.
Card sharks
Is the second mortgage crisis threatening the American credit card market?
If there is blood in the water, it is natural that sharks appear nearby.
Now that the American housing market is failing, predators are focusing on the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs' analysts believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of residential loans, the credit card market could lose up to $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
Both the description rate for unrecovery loans and the default rate for late payments over 30 days have increased.
HSBC reported a loss of $1.4 billion last month in the US consumer financing segment, partly due to the financial weakness of card holders.
At the same time, panic is early.
The ratio of descriptions and late payments remains low.
The late payment rate of 3.89% calculated by Moody's credit rating agency for the third quarter is one percentage point lower than the historical average.
The decrease in the rates is partly explained by technical factors.
The change in the US rules on individual insolvency in 2005 has resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of whistle-blowings in the credit card market, while at the same time causing large losses; a re-increase in the number of bankruptcy applications (and thus in the description ratio) is expected, whether or not the total amount of the borrowing conditions deteriorates.
The payment rate, which shows the proportion of monthly consumer credit payments, is also solid on the market.
In addition, confidence in credit card-backed securities is quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney at the TowerGroup research firm estimates that the volume of emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The evidence of the impact of the mortgage crisis on the credit card market is clear: consumers will increase the debt on credit cards to pay for housing loans.
At the same time, card issuers primarily monitor cash flow and not asset value, so the fall in house prices does not necessarily lead to a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
The situation may be beneficial for creditors.
If the property is less than the value of the mortgage loan, the incentive for consumers to make credit repayments will be reduced; as a result, the repayment of debts on credit cards will move ahead with priority.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers are able to adapt faster and more flexible than mortgage creditors to changing conditions.
Theoretically, this should reduce the risk of sudden re-use of assets.
"It's unlikely that one day we'll wake up and revalue the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, the financial manager of Capital One.
If a subprime sudden crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual decline is much more likely.
If the fall in housing market prices and the fall in lending puts America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a harsh future.
It's worth watching those predators.
British bankers found themselves guilty of the Enron case
On Wednesday, the three British bankers who were brought before the court to investigate their role in fraud involving the name of Enron, Andrew Faston, were declared guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were initially found innocent of the charge of weekly fraud, which suggests that they co-operated with Fastow in a secret fraud committed in 2000 that they wanted to be rich at the expense of their employer.
Their trial began in January.
However, in a court hearing before the U.S. district judge, Ewing Werlein Jr., each of them admitted to being guilty of one - order fraud.
Three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group's Greenwich NatWest division have become known in Great Britain during the two-year extradition procedure.
The end of the investigation of Enron's case after the collapse of 2001 is still pending in the United States.
The first prosecution against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of a government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
The three brokers crucified to the NatWest Triad, according to the charge against them, traveled to Houston in 2000 to prepare fraud together with Fastow and Michael Copper, who was then the right hand of Fastow.
Fastow, responsible for the bankruptcy of Enront, also controlled the Enron subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank was not aware of any share of the subsidiary, but the three British men well knew that the interest was very high.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank’s share of $1 million in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to acquire a stake in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow misinformed Enron by buying a subsidiary holding worth $20 million from Greenwich NatWest.
In fact, the 20 million dollars were the mark of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The prosecution says the bankers made 7.3 million, while Fastow, Copper and others made $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed to his double guilt over Enron's role in the collapse.
The British three was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving three years and a month's sentence in a Texas prison.
The three English men were allowed to travel to the United States in bail of $1 million each, where they would stay during the trial.
Enron, the seventh-largest American company, reported bankruptcy in December 2001, after the accounting tricks that have been used for years could no longer cover up the millions of debts and reported to be profitable but actually loss-making companies.
As a result of the collapse, thousands of jobs have ceased, the market value has fallen by more than $60 billion and the value of pension funds by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, the founder of Enron and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their bankruptcy involvement in the company.
Skilling is currently serving more than 24 years in prison.
The conspiracy, fraud and other charges imposed on Lay have ceased with the man's death last year.
No poverty in Moscow
A Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with Rolls-Royce engines, will start at 54 million dollars, which will do the journey between Moscow and Los Angeles without interruption, with a tank.
However, this amount is only a change for some Russian rich ones.
"It's got 18 passengers in it," said Dan Firer, the Gulfstream representative.
"But no one orders that kind of seat because machines are bought for private families or corporate managers."
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors at the four-day, exclusive, Millionaires Fair, which was held in a huge exhibition hall around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury items have been rented at the exhibition, hoping that the Russians will be interested in all the yachts covered with mahogany and covered with diamonds, up to 50 cents of coolants.
Mr. Firer was watching carefully the bright orange Porsche on the stand next to him.
"It's a nice car, but it doesn't touch our products," he said.
"Private aircraft after the United States have the largest market in Russia."
The Russian capital seems to be swimming in the money like Dallas did in the light of the oil explosion.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some American millionaires went to Europe. These Americans were considered material here." said Marshall Goldman, Senior Scholar of the Davis Center of Harvard University Studies in Russia and Eurasian.
Like the Japanese gamblers in Saudi Arabia in the 1970s and Japan in the 1990s, the Russians have now become the world's most spectacular poets.
The most exclusive luxury brands require their share of the gold fever.
At another conference organised by the luxury industry in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnaul, President of LVMH, shared his opinion on how to sell high-value products on markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organised by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes' richest list, there are 53 billion people living in Russia, with a total of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103 thousand, who can account for a total of $670 billion, found a study by the economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research in the former Soviet Union.
(According to World Bank data, in 2005 the number of people living under the minimum living standards in Russia was 15.8%.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires living in Moscow, which is why we are all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris Jewelry in London.
Nicole participated in the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are irrefutably cared for, and men are a real treasure mine."
On Sunday night, two real estate agents in the halls, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, both dedicated themselves and their clients to a millionaire.
"I watched the cars and tried to make a decision between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Yumatova, a young man who has been industriously rushed into his custom-designed clothing, as if he had become accustomed to this uproar.
The fair was primarily organised for the rich, brand-oriented Russian buyers who were willing to go around a scaffolded, cyfra-red location after several hours on the market, where they could find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, usual billiard tables, dubai apartments and Gund plugs.
For average people, the ticket costs EUR 30 ($44.57).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who has a patriotic view of the Dutch china manufacturer Royal Delft's stand, compared to a wall-sized hand-painted, blue-painted Rembrandt imitation.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in outstanding things."
Indeed, the sellers here said that the Russians who have been rich for a long time (based on Russian standards, this means 10-15 years) have already passed from the external logos to the Bagatelli brands made in a limited number of copies that would not enter a trade fair.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaires, and tourists spent every day crowded.
And some of them bought it.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the director of the King Koil Beds company, said that he sold two mattresses made of silk, cashmere and cotton, made with a gold thread.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a salesman of A1 Moto on the supply of high-quality cars with modern alarms, reported that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire.
Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car manufacturer with unique needs, sold three coolants on Sunday afternoon to Rolls-Royce Phantoms. The bars are similar to connected chain bracelets and cost $55,000 each.
The reporters also presented a wheel for the owner of a Russian casino, which Swarovski said was involved with crystals in order to create the appearance of a Roulette wheel.
A set of four pieces: $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather and a picture of his wife's face from a circus cube will not necessarily use these objects." said Karapetian.
"He'll keep them in the garage guarding 30-40 cars."
Despite the fact that many of its Russian clients are rich, according to Karapetian, the term "Russian Millionaire" is not a great privilege nowadays, given the rapid rise in real estate prices there.
"Who bought real estate in Moscow four or five years ago, is likely to be a millionaire today, if not in cash, but at least on paper."
"There's more than you know."
Those who are not millionaires could have at least created the appearance of wealth in front of the Russian asset management company of the Alliance Continental.
The company has built four English-style telephone booths, which have been accumulated with millions of counterfeit dollar bankers.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, told me that his team printed 500 thousand counterfeit banknotes to the Millionaires' Fair.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with the money. Many took photos of themselves using a cell phone as they lay in the money ring or just put a few million dollars in the pocket.
"You see, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire," said Karryev.
There's a surgical malpractice suspected behind a death in New Jersey.
It happened the day before Thanksgiving that Ronald Livingston looked on the windows of the restaurant called "Just a Little Healthier" and saw an ambulance stop on Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car arrived shortly after.
Then another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stop," said Mr. Livingston, one of the supervisors at the restaurant on Wednesday.
"Then I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found out that the dead woman was 41 years old named Olga Arroyo, who used to work as a senior assistant to the director of the New York Police Department.
The investigation is currently ongoing to determine whether the death was caused by an unauthorized cosmetic surgery under West Scott Avenue 212, which has not been identified by the police.
The authorities have so far failed to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they hope that the results of the toxicology tests in a few weeks' time will shed light on this mysterious death, which has affected the high-ranking employees of the New York Police Department with great pain.
Arroyo, whose voice was known to many in the department, worked as an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006.
"He was loyal, diligent and reliable," he said about McCarthy Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"..he was my housekeeper.
He was my protector."
McCarthy told me that Mrs Arroyo was currently married to Jimmy Arroyo, working on the Sesame Product Control Committee, and left two boys, 14 and 11 years old, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, the spokesperson of Theodore J. Romankow, the prosecutor of Union county, said that the detectives are working to investigate whether Mrs Arroyo was the victim of an unauthorized surgeon's intervention.
"The probabilities are increasing," said Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
The authorities report that they arrived at the house around 3 p.m. November
21st and Mrs Arroyo were found on the couch.
He's already been declared dead at the scene.
It's been over a week, and the police have told us very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't tell me if Castro was already being heard by the detectives.
The study participants will examine whether part of the house has been operated as a medical clinic.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Castro's home, where there was an angry rose bush in the narrow front yard and a lady barked from the back of the house.
Next to the door leading to the basement, there was a blue tank in the car entrance with the sign "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in food and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks to side.
McCarthy recalled that after 25 years at the New York police station, Mrs Arroyo was an invaluable help in helping her to fit into the unusual and unrefined political culture of the new city.
"He always said, "You'll be better off with this and that."
"He's always been here when I arrived in the morning, and he's always been there when I left in the evening.
It was confusing."
The expectations of Fed's interest rate cuts lead to a storm on the world stock markets
On both sides of the Atlantic, stock prices jumped yesterday, after the calming statements of the Vice-President of the Central Bank of America have increased the hopes that Fed will try to facilitate investment opportunities with further interest cuts.
The stock markets in London, New York and across Europe have been saved after Donald Kohn, who has declared Fed President Ben Bernanke's right hand, has to react "flexibly and pragmaticly" to the constant unrest in financial markets.
In addition to the clear objective of Kohn to mitigate the markets in the face of the re-sustaining credit crisis, he stated that the present unrest "has partially rejected the market's progress towards the end of September and October".
He said that if the increased confusion persists, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on the credit conditions of households and companies.
The statements were interpreted by investors as ready to inject fresh capital into the US markets or even further interest reductions in order to stabilise the credit conditions.
The statements have also been a source of relief for Wall Street, which has recently been hit by several bad news about the American economy, such as the negative record of the number of apartment sales in the US.
The adverse effect of financial unrest was also confirmed by the announcement by Bear Stearns investment bank that, in order to offset losses in the second-market residential loans sector in the US, 650 employees and 4% of global labour force were made available as part of the cost reduction.
A total of 20 jobs in London, which employs 1500 workers, are affected by the above measure.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average increased by 331 points, 2.55 percent, and closed at 13.289,40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index increased by 2.65%.
The FTSE 100 index in London increased by 165,5 points, 2.7 percent and closed at 6.306,2 and thus increased the value of British blue chip companies by more than 39 pounds.
The German Dax increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 by 2.3 percent.
The credit market unrest has been renewed since the European Central Bank's high demand auction in April 2001 with three-month maturity papers at 4.7%.
After a steady increase in the interbank interest rate after 12 November, Libor reached the highest level seen since September 6,59 %, the Bank of England was all under increased pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB and to provide additional capital to the financial markets in London.
In England, there is a demand for a decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
He gave me two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who's the English team's sixth field in Candy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And in the context of the first test against Sri Lanka, it's no less important who makes the decision?
The latter question is still valid, on the one hand, because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection team, who temporarily performs this particular task, assists chief coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan in the decision. On the other hand, because the English Executive Director, Hugh Morris' desk, is starting to fill an account with requests for national or, at least, one-off selections.
Among the two players, the shorter one that does not get the sixth batter, but, as is known, life, and especially sports are often unfair.
It's never easy to tell how you get to the top of someone's profession, while someone else can't get past a lower level.
It is not only the Cricket that it is difficult - often subjective - to choose.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to Shah if that happens?
The same question may be raised in other areas of life, for example, when we say John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart young leaders with excellent qualifications, who know business, would be placed before the decision-makers, while only one of them has room for one of them.
Who can tell which level is a cricket player without being thrown into the deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, the data have a major influence on the decision-making process, but the possibilities are equally important.
In a team, the player must take a look at the captain at the right moment in the Cricket Gate, and a batter should have a chance to become a big player on a regular basis.
Catching the eyes of the sorters is much more complicated.
For example, more people have played better than James Anderson in the past season, yet he is a sure team member on the first test, despite Stephen Harmison's own claim that he's in good shape and that he's doing very well.
Anderson's 32 first-class gate battled with a strike and 33 runs to participate in the tour.
Chris Tremlett only hit 29, but both of you have had successful moments at the highest level, and they hope that this will continue to happen in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at the Asgiriya Stadium, well, that will be decided on the basis of opinions.
This decision may upset or break anyone's career, but it may not have a particular impact on the future.
Four years ago, Sri Lankan Gareth Batty played all the tests and did well with five gates and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was then emerging, who became a prominent and decisive test critic, who may still have been underestimated even today, despite the fact that he scored a double hundred points against the Australians in Australia.
It is likely that at their meeting in Asgiriya Stanion today, listening to their conservative feelings of Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, Shah will cast their votes against the young life force and the dynamics of Bopara.
Both have arguments.
Shah is in favour of the bright and successful debut of the 88th Bombay test in the quarters against his seven-year-old 22-year-old Bopara's six-year-old, who also achieved 32 first-class 100th in outstanding screw-ups.
However, the fact that the Middlesex player Shah ran only ten against West Indies in two quarters at home in May, in the Lorda, and that Vaughan, who fought for re-enactment in the next game, ran into the immediate resistance of the sorters, seems to have reduced the perseverance that was clearly seen in Bombay.
Against him, Essex's universal talent is a life-giving and inexorable player.
There's nothing to be upset about on the Cricket Course, but he described his behavior outside the field well when he got upset at an exhibition with a four-wheeler of the team's auto sponsor, Volkswagen.
But the first thing he did after that was to take over Vodafone's phone (naturally sponsored) and call his distant teammate, Alastair Cook, to ask him, "Have you seen this?"
Bopara is a better tracker with classics. With its curved medium steps, he develops a favourable pitch angle, and his punches are confident and skilful.
Choosing the right person is one thing and another is the right moment.
Maybe it's the true art of choosing.
Personally, I'd give Bopara the chance now, which doesn't mean I don't think Shah would be a prominent player if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he was the one playing this weekend.
They're transporting refugees home by bus to work and pick up the fight with Al-Qaeda.
Since yesterday, the first buses from Syria have arrived in Baghdad with Iraqi refugees who have run out of money or have run out of visas, or actually those who hope that the city has returned to order.
There are also those among them who have returned to fight with the soldiers who drove them out of their homes.
The bus station in Mansour was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before an 800-person, dozens of buses from Damascus arrived.
"I decided to go to Syria after a lot of doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Dr. Sabah al-Qubaisis sunnita.
"Today I came back because I saw what happened on TV and in the papers in Baghdad and that the city is now safe.
"They say the Mahdi Army has stopped killing people," he added, referring to Mockada al-Sadr's militia minister, who has now stopped the Shiite army.
The 38-year-old Shiite teacher Qassim al Atwani from Amariyah, mostly a Sunniat, returned home with two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime prevented the Iraqis from working.
The ski neighbors of Amariya called him and urged his return home, saying with the help of the troops supported by the Americans, he managed to push Al-Qaida out of their bastion in the western part of the capital.
One of Jordan's first arrivals was a Sunnita and Shiite tribal leader who fled from the home of a grenade attack in Sleikh, North Baghdad, after encouraging his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaida.
He's here to fight back.
"Two days ago, my friends called me and told me they created an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed support for me and my sons.
That's why I came back today," said the 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many spoke of the fact that peace has been strengthened in the capital since the American troops were involved and that armed civilian forces that cooperated with the Americans have lured them home.
Yet, more were forced to return from Damascus because of visa - related and financial problems.
The 51-year-old, three-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai voiced a widespread view amongst refugees that the Shiite Prime Minister of Nouri al-Maliki asked the Syrian Government to reject the visa application of refugees to force their return home.
It is believed that more than two and a half million people fled the death squads in the country.
"It was all right until al-Maliki visited Syria and put pressure on the government not to issue more visas for Iraqis in order to move them home," said the Sunnita retired.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I ran away."
One of the causes of the relieving of violence is that the sunnits were removed from the ski areas, while the skis also left the sunnitary areas, resulting in a decrease in tension in many areas.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will once again upset the spirits, which may lead to more struggles.
Kis Saar-rural - education and training
The smallest federal province has a leading role in vocational education and training, and its higher education has an international orientation.
There is only one educational area where islanders struggle with the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I explained to a non-Apartmenter today that we are not French" - this self-ironic slogan is being advertised on his posters on the occasion of the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system in the Saar region, which, based on the IW surveys, can boast the fifth place.
In this way, higher education institutions are working closely with neighbouring countries, even because of tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
Students here can complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree to date.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6% high.
However, island-rural learners are also more attractive than average from the Saar-rural colleges and universities - many of them have no secondary education.
"They take advantage of the opportunities of vocational training in Saarland," explains Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert at the German Institute of Economics.
Young people gain further education in more than a fifth of vocational education and training schools, with the result that the Saar region exceeds the federal average by more than seven percent.
The combined opportunities of vocational and higher education have also been well developed.
The infrastructure for double studies is second in Germany in terms of population.
However, despite practical training and increasing interest, the number of graduate engineers has decreased by one third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education of the island therefore required higher education institutions for a marketing campaign centred on engineering.
"We initiated many reforms in primary schools after the first Pisa study," said a spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests across the country.
To make children start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge. It is a model that in the meantime began to be copied by other federal provinces.
Whether the students' performance will improve permanently will only be answered by future comparative studies.
Based on the Pisa survey carried out in 2003, the proportion of students at risk narrowed from 29 to 20 per cent.
Overall, however, the performance of the Saar region has not improved as much as that of the other federal provinces.
Bajorans count better.
The greatest revenge of the islanders in the Pisa feat is not taken into account - otherwise, in this area, they could be reaping prizes,
Because the language of the neighbouring countries is a mandatory subject in high school - even if the islanders are not French.
Chávez Converts Watches
In Venezuela, classes are different in the near future than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez will turn the timers back in the Latin American country in half an hour.
In the meantime, Chávez became a laughing stock in Spain.
As Venezuela’s official newspaper stated, under a new law, the clocks are reversed four and a half hours from the time of Greenwichi.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
The anti-US Chávez justified, among other things, its decision to force the entire hours-based time zones of the United States to the world.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the interruption of relations with neighbouring Colombia due to a hostage.
The nationalist politician on the left stated that until the conservative Alvaro Uri remains the President of Colombia, neither the Head of State nor the Colombian Government will be in contact.
"I cannot do this because of my own dignity," said Chávez, who is calling for a constitutional reform which the citizens of the oil country have to express their opinion on Sunday within a referendum.
The reform would significantly build its power in the country.
The reason for the debate was Uribe's decision to withdraw his mandate from Chávez to negotiate with the Colombian Marxist rebels the release of hostages.
Uribe decided to "arcul spit" on Venezuela, giving voice to his critic Chávez on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chavez.
In the country, a new cell phone ringtone has attracted: "Por quo no te callas" (Why don't you shut your mouth) - this is what the sentence that has already been downloaded by more than half a million people from the Internet.
The sentence comes from the King of Spain, John Károly, who was so upset at the last summit in Latin America by the constant protests of the populist politician in Balold that he had thus spoken.
In 2007, the fall in wages threatens the Germans
According to a forecast, the fall in real wages is threatening German workers this year, despite the strong economic situation.
Experts supported their pessimistic projections for a bunch of reasons.
According to the Hans-Brockler Foundation, in 2007, employees can actually count less wages than in the previous year.
"The reason for this is the modest wage development, the increase in the general turnover tax and the rapid increase in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn, a staff member of the Macroeconomic and Economic Research Institute of the "Bild" newspaper.
There may also be additional burdens on workers in relation to unemployment insurance.
In his statement to the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung", Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück stated that in the current situation, a correct and reasonable reduction in unemployment insurance to 3.3% at the beginning of the new year.
In all cases, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be placed in such a difficult position to apply to the Alliance for credit or support, they quoted the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD politician.
It became known on Tuesday that the price explosion of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation for 13 years.
In an annual comparison, prices increased by a total of 3 per cent.
Venus is the evil twin of the Earth
Despite the harsh atmosphere of Venus, it is more similar to the Earth than it has been assumed so far: in its atmosphere, the European "Venus Express" space probe has discovered lightning discharges, and in its polar regions, it has discovered winds like those that occur on Earth in the winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that Venus will get lightning.
The European "Venus Express" space probe provided evidence - it discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: lightnings in Venus spread from cloud to cloud at a height of 56 km, reports Christpher Russell, an associate of the University of California in Los Angeles on "Nature" scientific journals.
According to the famous "preliminary theory", lightnings caused the formation of life on Earth: According to the theory, storms triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, building blocks of life.
Not in Venus: "If there ever was a life there, it could have been in very early times," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Currently, there can hardly be a living organism on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is 100 times thicker than on Earth, and temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"It may be that Venus is the devil's twin brother, but it is his twin brother," he decapitated Russel.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus is so similar in mass and size to the Earth on a completely different path of development.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in Venus research, because since the early 1990s, no probe has been on its way specifically to discover this planet.
The latest research results presented in several "Nature" articles are, in the opinion of researchers, not only proof of the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also think that the similarity of the adjacent planet to the Earth is greater than we assumed for the first time," Esa said.
In addition to the already known North Pole, researchers discovered an even faster moving cloud vortex on the South Pole.
The phenomenon reminds us of the air currents of the earth's winter hemisphere, says the research group led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second highest planet of the solar system is almost the same as that of the Earth, and with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers almost the size of the Earth.
The celestial body, also called the Evening Star, is around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower around its own axis: one venus day lasts 243 earth days.
Although the surface temperature of 460 Celsius, combined with the pressure of Venus 92 bar, is hardly similar to that of Earth, scientists start from the fact that both planets have been created under completely similar conditions.
Both of them had water that remained on Earth as an ocean, while Venus went to the universe.
And while on Earth carbon dioxide is bound in carbon mattes, Venus is a major part of the atmosphere.
Coughler's defending Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
Mr Köhler, the President of the German Republic demands the conclusion of the debate between the parties which exploded around the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office.
In an indirect way, he was critical of the SPD for attacking the Chancellor after the September reception.
The German President of Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's authority and called on the Great Coalition to conclude the debate around the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not show ourselves as a divided nation to the outside world in this matter," said Köhler to the Handelsblatt newspaper.
At the same time, Köhler expressed his understanding of the fact that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) received the Dalai Lama in September.
"Human rights are universally valid to me, even if I respect the diversity between cultures," emphasised Köhler.
Everyone is aware of the need for Germany to ensure a delicate balance in foreign policy, and stressed the President of the Republic; however, he is defending Merkel against the accusation that the Chancellor would pursue a new Chinese policy.
"The Federal Chancellor did not break up with the traditional "a Chinese" policy.
China is aware of that too," said Köhler.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his disapproval of the reception of the Dalai Lama and therefore became the target of attacks in the Union's ranks.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's "carcass policy" in the field of foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office, there have been severe disturbances in the German-China situation.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only withdrew the invitation of German Finance Minister Pier Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to SPIEGEL’s information, frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the two countries.
The Chinese Head of State of Wen Jiabao has now called upon Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that the reception of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China rejects the official acceptance by European politicians of Tibetan religious leaders, confirmed by Wen Jiabao.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama have shown that it is trying to break up additional Tibetan territories including Tibet and other provinces from China.
Schäuble protects against disturbances such as those in France
Street conflicts with the police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble protects against disturbances such as those in France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not encroach on street violence, demands the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricades were on fire, randomists were shooting a shotgun at the police: After the serious riots of young people in France, Federal Minister for Home Affairs Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is afraid of similar developments in Germany.
"We must make sure that the social explosives do not accumulate in our home, and do not be forced into violence.
We need to take this seriously," he said to the "Neue Presse" newspaper in Hannover.
Not all youths adapt to rapid changes in social reality.
Associations, provinces and communities are currently working intensively on solving problems, said Schäuble.
This does not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first successes have been achieved."
However, it is too early to resolve the emergency.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that German suburbs do not have urban and sociological problems such as those in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, in the last night, young people fought serious street fighting with the police.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were on fire.
In view of this, the Federal Government, Kenan Kolat, is the leader of the German Turkish Communities, required a higher degree of activity in terms of integration.
In the context of the riots in France, Kolat warned of the "risks of imitation".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as that in France,
Yet action is necessary.
Kolat indicated that among young people under 25 from immigrant families the unemployment rate was "higher than the average".
Above all, more educational places should be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must give the young people a prudence."
However, the head of the Turkish Community added that "social surveillance within the family" is more present in Germany than in France.
In addition, many young people from a migrant family would not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warns, "We have to keep on guard."
Young people "must have the opportunity to work and receive education as quickly as possible".
Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Paris, in Villiers-le-Bel, there was complete peace during the night.
Hundreds of police officers were ready for deployment, and a helicopter headlighted the area.
The competent authorities have reported three arrests and a few burning dumpsters and cars.
Since the report, a security unit of about 1,000 people has provided for peace.
The police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, announced by Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie after his visit to the suburbs.
During the Tuesday night, 80 policemen were wounded in the wake of the mutiny in the Bullies-Le.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The revolutions broke out in a traffic accident involving two young people losing their lives on Sunday.
According to the D.A.'s first findings, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
Clouder in Angela’s Empire
The action of the Chancellor is a proof that the coalition is at its end - and nothing is expected of him.
In fact, which country does the Federal Chancellor live in?
It must be established, following a vague, dissatisfied and indiscriminate act at the general debate of the Bundestag: it is not here - it is not in the country whose governance it would be his job to govern.
He rejected the accusation with a very arrogant sentence that Angela Merkel would focus too much on foreign policy.
It's territorial, he answered, and in this way he just expressed himself that he doesn't want to understand what his critics are talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how appropriate the reproaches are.
In the meantime, there was no real interest or empathy in the country's problems.
Instead, Angela the Clouder showed up: a real-life politician who flees into foreign politics and is also his own insecurity.
An example of climate protection: Heiligendammi is unscrupulously praising himself for its decisions, but he does not know how to achieve the air-conditioning targets in the country.
At all, as far as self-esteem is concerned, such modesty would not have been permitted by the CDU's chairman two years earlier.
Now he's clinging to the fact that prosperity has a positive effect on humans.
This brings harm to his reputation as a pragmatic personality who solves problems instead of word flowers.
However, in Angela’s empire, the problems of domestic politics are only side-by-side.
Child poverty and the problems of the low-income?
He only appreciates this for a few words.
It is a lot to say in this regard how often you are going to make a language trip when it comes to family allowances.
Merkel has to hold on three times to bring together a half-legged sentence.
When it comes to specifics, it stumbles in a foreign area.
Crisis Division
During the debate of the Republican presidential candidates on YouTube, the two favors, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, must be feared of an external candidate.
The tension of the candidates has already surfaced on the first subject.
Mitt Romney tells his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, that he made New York a "parlor of illegal immigrants."
"I would say that his own house was a refuge for illegal immigrants," Giuliani returns, and he throws up to the eyes of former governor of Massachusetts that he employed undocumented immigrants as a private person.
The candidates are going into a seizure: Since the Republican camp still has no single-sponsored favorite, the eight presidential candidates are using the debate on CNN to undermine their opponent's credit.
The 30-second videos sent by Internet users via YouTube are little more than short summaries.
"We put Hitler in power with this type of isolacionism", rubs John McCain under the nose of his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the circle who demands immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also thoroughly washes his head on the Vietnam vet, when he refuses to condemn the so-called Waterboarding as torture, the interrogation method in which the repression is simulated.
However, the fact that important topics of the campaign are beyond Iraq and the debate on torture shows the reactions of the people of St. Petersburg, Florida.
There is a loud applause in the room when the conservative values are praised and when future tax increases are rejected.
Meanwhile, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming increasingly evident.
"I was wrong at the time," says Romney with regret and apologizes to the supporters and television viewers for putting the vote in front of the abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is upset when she is asked for her views on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf is the first to rule as a civilian
One day after the military retreated, he was defeated as President of Musharraf in Pakistan.
This will put an end to eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, had his five-year term of office suspended on Thursday.
The Pakistani television broadcasted the ceremony live from the capital, the Islamic Presidential Palace.
Musharraf swore to the Constitution and to the good of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership office to his confidential Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus gave priority to international pressure from the United States.
For the first time, the former General has been ruling as a civilian head of state for eight years after he broke into military coup without bloodshed.
Musharraf has met a basic demand of the West and the opposition by his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
Another important requirement is the abolition of the state of emergency that Musharraf announced on 3 November.
According to Prosecutor General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will cease to exist shortly after his resignation, thereby fulfilling an additional demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country in which Musharraf planted lawyers that sympathize with him at the beginning of November after the emergency was published has rejected any protest over the re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four were injured in the northern tribal area of northern Vaziristan due to an attack on a military convoy.
According to the military spokesperson, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghanistan border.
The Krautrock's dads are coming back.
The German super team of the 1970s is playing again: The three band members of Harmonia have been dusting their instruments again for a concert in Berlin.
On the occasion of the re-assemble, a cut footage of their light age, "Live 1974", will appear.
They were better known abroad at that time.
The reported sensation killed the body in the person of the three agreed gentlemen around the dinner table.
Each has its own instrument, its own cable and, above all, its own buttons.
Dieter Moebius is in the middle of a snow-white shirt in his 63 years of age.
From the left, Michael Rother, who is 57 years old, provides escorts with a laptop and guitar.
From the audience point of view, the 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius curves and focuses on the console.
Each one of them produces some kind of noise, and once and for all, it produces a rhythm.
And all of this sometimes ends up being some randomly traditional music.
All of this, however, does not seem to bother you gentlemen in particular.
It was a great thrill for those who liked the Krautrock musical direction that the Harmonia band was playing again.
What we can tell you here is that as a result of proper follow-up, the name has flown through the collective pop-up, but it has never left any permanent clues that we have missed this band painfully after 32 years.
But why can't the Germans celebrate the legends of their 70s?
Especially since what we misguidedly call a Krautrock, it has always been appreciated in England and America more than in its own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Life in 2003 to the still living members of the Cologne Can band, the German pops sat in the hall with a incomprehensible face.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers laureate even thanked La Dusseldorf and Neu!, the wonders became unlimited.
At the concerts, Michael Rother sat on stage as an old buddy.
Two sides of the same coin of domestic rejection and foreign acceptance.
The only reason for the memory is because the trio existed for only two years, and during that time it had a far smaller effect than others attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with Conrad Schnitzler under the name of the most promising Cluster.
At first, they played in the basement under the Schaubühne Theatre in Berlin.
Then in Dusseldorf, for economic reasons, to a record company funded by the Church.
Rother helps the Kraftwerk band for a short time, and in parallel, the perhaps most radical German band, Neu!, has gained fame as guitarist.
In 1973, however, Roth followed the musicians of Cluster into exile in Weserbergland Forst.
There, in Alter Weserhof, they lived in a 16th - century Rom as a Communist who fled town.
Less ideologically than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still a babysitter.
Their lives are more like an idyllic artist.
It is said that the flag of Harmonia Ottostein came out of the garbage and that this is how they found the name of their art.
Some of these things were recorded by the Harmonia.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next album is called "De Luxe".
Despite the loose and modest music, the band had a financial need.
The stock exchange collection alone did not provide for finding themselves.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Grissem in front of a record audience of only 50 people, so someone remembers.
It was Rother's idea to exert and practice Harmonia on occasion at the time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The gang announced its disbandment in 1975.
Roth ended up at esoterics and maintained himself from albums like "Flammende Herzen".
The Cluster was revived in the 1980s, which has been more successful since then than the Harmonia has ever been.
The live album Herbert Grönemeyer is thanks to Grissem.
His record company, listening to Greenland’s name, designed to care for Krautrock as a special German supplement to live music.
In this context, Neu! has already been dug up just as much as Roedelius's solo work.
The resurrection of Harmonia will take place in the House of Cultures in Berlin.
Public money, within the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, our British ancestor and the author of the book "Krauck Sampler" are also present.
There's also the idea owner of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
All of this outlines the impact of Krautrock on the next pop-music era.
In this regard, Harmonia fills the space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno's statement, along with the most unusual sounds, is floating in the room, "The only true music, his future."
There are pictures of the producer in the room of a farmhouse with Harmonia.
Displaying further black and white photos of the cobble cable equipment serves the construction of legend.
In the lobby, the three veterans reoccupied with improvisation.
This simply means that microphones are recorded for organ and drumming, with the intention of using instruments that can produce their own escalated sound effects.
Today, electrical music looks like electric music.
Three deep into the technique.
Even the chores don't change anything.
They're coughing and kissing under Barbara Morgenstern's direction, and singing "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
After all, Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music colleges (Can), technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or running away from artistic and social conventions (cluster).
If anyone calls out "68," they don't go all the way, and the Harmonia won't let you out of your way yet.
Even the most self-evident thing is considered on the stage.
Where does music start and where does it end?
This can nerve-crazy, or it can offer it to you in passing moments of exceptional happiness.
Richard Gere's just not cynical enough.
Through the "Hand" and "Mörderischer Frieden", two films deal with the Balkan war again.
But none of them are convincing.
Basic thinking or too much action and shooting, or too emotional.
Even Richard Gere himself can't help you with the hunt.
First of all, the good news is that although the two war criminals are guilty, Karajics and Mladics are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, they have found Richard Gere again in the dark background of the war in Bosnia.
Recently, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because the many good-boy-saying roles of women in emotional films and the many press conferences on Buddhism have even taken us away from looking at him.
And here, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most pressing argument in addition to maybe we're still watching the "Handing" movie.
It is a wonderful and smiling performance: It is basically what Simon Hunt's military scientist could have become if fate and the film industry were not so kind to him: A man who left his best years behind long ago, but still preserved a significant part of his former appeal as a ruinous monument of his decline.
However, the film "Handing" and the German production "Mörderischer Frieden" started to be screened this week, despite this adu, only continues to the endless series of failed films about the Balkan war.
We don't have to waste much on "Mörderischer Frieden": the film is about two German soldiers serving in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian woman from the snipers in Kosovo, and one of them is suddenly in love with her.
Although it is to be welcomed that, for the time being, the Serbians are not pictured as the sole cause of all evils, the film that carries the shallowness of TV films is too quickly lost in the shooting and the event-rich scenes.
"Cobra 11" has a character, not a highway, but a war.
On the other hand, it is in the case of the 'Handing' that we can see for example why no really good film has actually been made about the Balkan war.
The story of the three U.S. military scientists who are coming up to track down the Serbian war criminal who listened to the name "Róka", with another director, other scriptwriter (both in Richard Shepard's personal union) might have become a new "Apocalypse now" in another age.
After all, the stories show a surprising similarity: in both cases small groups cut the forest to do what the army is unable to do - and in both cases, the journey to madness is going on.
One of the reasons for the failure of the hunt is simply not to let Simon Hunt be the degenerate cynic that listens to his heart like he was at the beginning.
No, and in the script, he even spent a romantic relationship with a recently murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
The "Handing" will slip forever when the reporters reach what NATO, CIA and the world's bounty hunters have not been able to do in five years: they will take the war criminal and hand him over to the Mohamedan Bosnians for a fair revenge.
It's so bad that you'd rather go to the Hague International Court for a crime against the logic of cinema.
But the film's purpose is deeply human.
He intends to claim that Karajics and Mladics are still on the loose and suspect that the Americans and the French (which is said to be exceptionally uniform) are not pursuing the persecution intensively because of secret political agreements.
But good and evil sometimes resemble each other so much that you can think of a famous Brecht poem.
Here the poet writes of a wooden mask of Asian demon on his desk: "I look at the vulture on his side, which tells me how tiresome it is to be to be bad."
Films like "Handing" have the same oversized, human-headed masks, but they show how exhausting it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan War films.
They recently reported in the paper that all the Hollywood films about Iraq were a nasty fall.
We can add: we haven't even found a good film about South Africa yet.
Almost always valid: If a star roams in the world's crisis or minefields, it comes out of something like "The Ways of Freedom" with Patricia Arquette, "No Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamond" with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are just too close to time.
It had to be decades before Hollywood was able to film a good movie about the Holocaust with "Shindler's List".
There are probably still a few films - because the works of the Vietnam War, which are now classic, such as "The deer hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were not celebrated unanimously in your time as a masterpiece.
But it's possible that these days, when all mass murders arrive at our home in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about the conflicts in the world.
And it deprives the screenwriters of ignoring reality, which would be necessary to tell good stories.
After all, Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know how terrible the Nazi regime was.
Maybe you shouldn't strive for good if you want to make a good movie.
Maybe we need to focus on the sarcastically distant artistic vision of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between the historical novel Lemprière-lexicon and the Balkan war, he replied: "It depends only on certain things never change.
Grand Cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust is severely criticised for the Olympic resignation.
The mayor's demarcation of his proposal for the Olympics in Hamburg in the summer gave rise to intense criticisms in political and economic life.
A lot of people want to keep fighting for water toys.
Von Beust, however, is a powerful warning of reality in the process of chance-taking.
On Wednesday, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, Chief Executive Officer of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, declared the withdrawal to be "unfavourable for the economic environment".
No other project has recently unleashed such enormous motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, we cannot maintain a level playing field for sport policy."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative "based on modified time coordinates".
Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his earlier statements that his ambitions for the Olympic Games in Hamburg were not realistic until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the Olympic tender, but the German Olympics Sports Association," said von Beust to Welt ONLINE.
Following the decision of the Sports Association at the beginning of December on the Munich tender for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games.
"Putting this advantage to us means that we will not have a real chance within the period until 2028 that we have come up with."
However, we do not give up the dream forever, said von Beus.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) regretted von Beust's statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg does not intend to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early for us to shoot an opportunity to bury our plans now," said Günter Ploß, president of HSB on Wednesday.
In addition, the withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement of the Senate President at the General Assembly of the German Academy of Sports.
There, the application submitted to the city of Von Beust Hamburg by the 2015 Universale d’Adventure was characterised by the fact that it was not a substitute for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The College Sports Association only launched Hamburg as a city participating in the competition last week.
The civilian group of the SPD stated to the Senate that it left a valuable time for housing in Hamburg unexploited.
"Kleiner Grasbrook has been postponing the development of the Senate for years because he has been standing next to the Olympics and he has not built the apartment," said two SPD-representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continued to break the spear with the integrated plan for Olympic and later housing use for Kleiner Grasbrook, CDU unilaterally focused on the "event factor".
The proposal submitted for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games was a source of great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
However, Hamburg has failed in Lipcsé.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Anyone who connects the concepts of Sweden and the falada with each other is thinking of Ikea, and not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, the walls produced in Sweden have dark shadows on the list of works of Warhol.
The ninety-four "Stockholm-type" Brillo Box is mostly a fake.
After a few months of questioning the originality of the Brillo Boxes of Andy Warhol, 1968, the internal investigation of the moderna Museet in Stockholm has come to an outstanding conclusion: Pontus Hultén, former museum director, has donated six copies of the Brillo Box to Moderna Museet in 1995 - and most likely a hundred more "Stockholm-type" Brillo Boxs in the international art market.
The long and complicated chain of artistic and curative stunts of history.
Warhol created the first "Brillo Box" in New York in 1964, based on the red-blue-white-white design of the cardboard box of "Brillo" soap.
At an exhibition in Moderna Museet, 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of brillo boxes made of cardboard were produced: they were not from Warhol (for cost-saving reasons) but were transported directly from the Brillo cartel factory.
It wasn't about works of art, it was about their templates and simple exhibitions.
At the same time, Warhol authorised the production of some Brillo-faladas in Sweden in 1968, which were not produced in Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the age are now talking about 15 cases that were then certified as the Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the sign "Stockholm" to the art and auction history.
Some of them were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director, lied about the fact that in 1968 a hundred walls were manufactured and produced in Sweden, which was then left to Warhol.
In fact, the 105 crates of Hultén were manufactured in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in Saint Petersburg.
At that time, however, Warhol was dead three years ago.
Lars Byström, the main monumentist of Moderna Museet, also examined three Swedish private-owned boxes in addition to the six Brillo Box, owned by the Museum, of which two were made in Stockholm in 1968: The printed film was first printed and defrosted, followed by a brush with white oil paint.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the forks without a basis, not to oil, but to acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not certified by the artist, and should therefore be deleted from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo's Boxes," says Lars Nittve, Director of Moderna Museet: "Unless the New Yorkian 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' decides otherwise, the Moderna Museet will be classified as a copy/exhibition material."
The Authentication Board, of course, announced in June that it was investigating the "serious charges" raised in relation to soap boxes.
Since then, however, they have been covering for an unsolicited silence.
Manilai rebel soldiers give up
They gave up the rebellion in the Philippines, the soldiers who barricaded themselves at a hotel in Manila, and demanded the defeat of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
