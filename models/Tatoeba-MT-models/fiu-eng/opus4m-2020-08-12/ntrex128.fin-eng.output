Members of the Wales Congress are afraid they'll look like fools.
Some Members of the Assembly are confused by the proposal that they should be changed to MWP, a member of the Welsh Parliament.
This was the beginning of the plan to change the name of the delegation to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Committee of Representatives are concerned, regardless of their political base, that change can make them look at the subject of ridicule.
According to one Labour Party representative, the group is concerned that the name "prime with words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
According to a representative of the Plaid Party, the majority of the group is 'unsatisfied' and has proposed other options.
According to the representative of the Conservative Party, his group is 'open-minded' in the name change, but notes that the word MWP is a short verbal leap to the word stupidity.
In this connection, the Welsh language states the letter w in the same way as the English U in Yorkshire.
The Commission, which is currently preparing the legislative change needed to change the name, said: 'The final decision on the nomenclature of the members of the assembly is, of course, for the members themselves'.
The Wales Administration Act of 2017 empowers representatives to change their names.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, according to which the appointment of a representative to the Welsh Parliament will benefit from broad support.
The Commission favours Members of the delegation as a title of Members of the Wales Parliament or as a WMP, but the MWP option was the most supported in a public opinion poll.
The members of the Committee of Representatives are apparently proposing alternative names, but the lack of consensus can cause a problem for President Elin Jones, who is expected to make changes to the legislative proposal within a few weeks.
The legislation on changes also includes other changes to the work of the representative, such as the rules on the loss of representation and the form of a committee system.
At legislative level, members of the assembly may give their final vote on the title they should be invited to use.
The Macedonians are going to the electoral urn in the referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether the country's name will be changed to 'the Republic of North Macedonia'.
The referendum aims to resolve the dispute that has lasted decades with Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
For a long time, Athens has reiterated that the name of the northern neighbour is, in practice, a territorial requirement for its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership efforts.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, has said that he is ignoring the vote.
However, referendum supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argue that change of name is simply a price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martins' watches will be quiet when Harlem's churches live in difficult times
"The older people I've been talking to say there was a bar or church on every corner," says Adams.
"Now there's neither."
He said that losing bars is understandable.
He said, "The interaction with people has changed."
"Bars are no longer common living rooms in the neighborhood, where people meet regularly."
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property does not carry as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to the square of departure."
He added that churches can be replaced by residential houses and apartments that are not supported by the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
"More people who buy apartments from these buildings will be white," he says, "and so they rush the day when these churches close their doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most people moving to these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black settlement - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins decades later.
The original white Methodist Church moved out in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation acquired a building to own it.
St. Martinsin took over the black congregation under the leadership of Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the traders on 125th Street of Harlem's main street of commerce following the recruitment or promotion of these opposed blacks.
In 1939, a fire damaged the building badly. When Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild, they introduced a tower - watch game.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martins, proudly called the Tower Watch.
The expert who played the Tower Watch game in July called it a "cultural treasure" and an "unreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first tower watch game played by a black musician. It was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play the larger tower watch game at Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martins didn't replace him.
In recent months, St. Martins has developed a complex range involving architects and contractors employed by church laymen and, on the other hand, by the Episcopal Smuggling.
In July, Sakkasti - a government body of laymen of the church - wrote to the diocese about its concern that the diocese would "swirl the costs" to the sakasti, even though the sakasti had not been involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some in the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in relation to the diocese.
The shark hurt a 13-year-old hummingbird in California.
The authorities report that the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him while he was diving lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place on Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7:00 a.m.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB TV that he and his friends had been diving on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help. He and a group of others were ringing at the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel told me he thought he was just excited after he caught a lobster, but then he realized he was screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!
When he got to the boy, Hammel says he noticed that his whole collarbone had been torn open.
"I called everyone out of the water: there's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flew to Rady’s children’s hospital in San Diego, where his condition is reported to be critical.
The species of the attack shark is unknown.
During the media conference, Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said that a shark had been observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim had severe injuries to his upper arm.
The authorities closed the beaches from Casablanca Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swami for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's going to the United Kingdom beauty service
Sainsbury's will challenge Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in the state-of-the-art beauty care departments where expert advisors serve.
This is a significant movement for the UK beauty service, worth £2.8 billion, which will continue to grow even though the sale of fashion and household goods will deteriorate. The larger beauty care departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be extended to other shops next year.
Beauty care products are placed because supermarkets are trying to fill a shelf space previously reserved for television, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's tells us that its range of beauty care products doubles to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space, and they get their own brand-specific brands like Boots stores.
The supermarket will also re-launch its Boutique makeup selection. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly because of the growing demand of young shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume chain is testing rental shops in two Sainsbury's stores. The first was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second is opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet purchases and the transition of grocery stores to small one-off purchases will force supermarkets to invent new attractors for customers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that stores will look more like supermarkets, as the supermarket chain is struggling with low-cost shops such as Ald and Lidl by increasing services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores and also Habitat stores. The company reports that this has contributed to food sales and has made purchases profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to reform its beauty care and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended with a dispute about how the profits of the pharmaceuticals in supermarkets should be shared.
The new strategy follows the acquisition where Sainsbury's sold 281 stores to Celesio, who owned the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
The company reported that Lloyds was part of a plan to extend the range of luxurious skin care products to four shops with signs such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of our beauty care departments to improve our customer experience.
We have also invested in highly trained workers who are ready to advise customers.
Our brand selection meets all our needs and our attractive environment and our convenient location makes us a convincing beauty-care shopping site that challenges the traditional way to shop."
Peter Jones in his rage after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from the 11 million-dollar contract.
The Dragons Den star Peter Jones left in his rage when TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from the 11 million-dollar contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their homeware and costume brand Truly.
The two companies have been compared with the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of this Morning program announced his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby pissed off Dragons Den with Peter Jones' withdrawal from their profitable life-style business at the last few minutes. She now intends to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "infuriated" at a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of the Jones Business Empire in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star girl had admitted that her new $1.5 million contract would not leave enough time for their homeware and residential brand Truly.
The company has been compared with the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand, and it was besieged to double Willoughby's estimated assets of GBP 11 million.
After a 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain into one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, "Truly was clearly Holly's most important project.
It was his long - term plan to secure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision of departure has left everyone in the power of surprise.
No one had to believe on Tuesday events so close to the publication.
Marlow's head office has a warehouse full of products waiting for sale."
This Morning is one of the most secure stars in Britain, and experts say that his departure can cause millions of losses to the company due to product investments, including everything from pillows to candles and clothing to household supplies, not to mention the delay in publication.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby organized Cappin Truly in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones took over in March.
Couples vacation together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is baked from the new M&S brand ambassador and replaced by Ant McPartlin as the founder of the I'm A Celebrity ITV programme.
The source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."

He was joking about the criticisms that some would consider inappropriate to the President in the media and about his positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said he was pretending to be a news anchor.
"I didn't give up at all."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump's first meeting in July was an important step towards the decommissioning of North Korea.
However, the nuclear negotiations have been fined.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in July, the top diplomat of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a 'equivalent reaction' from the United States to the early Korean disarmament efforts.
On the other hand, he said that the United States was continuing its sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship."
He said that efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results, that the missile tests have been completed, that hostages have been helped into freedom and that the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relations with Kim.
"It is very easy to be Presidential, but instead of trying to get out 10 000 more in the halls, we would have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, showing the audience directly ahead.
Indonesian tsunami and quake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign voluntary organisations were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency needed for international assistance was not declared, although about 10 percent of the people in Lombok had become homeless.
"In many cases they have unfortunately made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is a little challenging," said Sumbing.
Although Save the Children form a group that travels to Paluu, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, the informant of the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation in order to see if international organisations would be allowed to participate in the assistance.
Indonesia is still unfortunately unprepared to face natural forces, taking into account the repeated earthquakes on a regular basis.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
It was likely that the human life was lost because of the lack of a tsunami warning siren, even though the warning was in force.
Traveling between many islands of Indonesia is challenging even under the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
The hospital ship assigned to Lomboki to assist the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before it reaches a new accident area.
President Widodo made the development of a worn infrastructure in Indonesia the centre of his election campaign, and he has provided money to improve roads and railways.
However, a financial deficit has plagued the administration of some, while the new elections are approaching next year.
The tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted a more ancient form of religion, are also increasing pressure.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought the streets with jungle knives, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons. This has resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 people and tens of thousands have had to leave their homes.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge sank the late level against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat on Saturday after painting 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqir 27 from Chelsea's goal when his team was in a position to lose the goal.
He moved the ball to the left before he horrified the shot at the rear pole.

"I saw Kante approach, took one touch, and fired without thinking too much."
Chelsea led the match in the half-life of 1-0 after the Belgian Eden Haard painting in 25 minutes.
The Blues tip gave Mateo Kovacic a frontal pass in the situation before he rode off near the middle of the field and spouted to the side of Liverpool.
Kovacic played in the middle of a fast wall feed.
And then he released her to the Penal Area with a great pass.
He ran away from defense and passed Liverpool with Alisson Becker's left foot shot in the back corner.
Liverpool will meet in the divisional phase of the Champions League at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday.

The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami will rise to 832 dead
The Indonesian Disaster Agency early on Sunday reported an earthquake and the number of tsunami deaths to 832 victims.
At a press conference, the agency’s informant Sutopo Purwo reported that many had been trapped in the ruins of the buildings that had collapsed, when the 7.5 magnetic earthquake struck on Friday and raised waves of up to six metres [6 m] high.
Fractures of broken buildings spread widely to 380 000 inhabitants, please.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding a woman stabbed to death.
The body of a woman found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning started a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7.55 in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police are asking the people in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at its root, but I appeal to anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also call on all taxi drivers, especially those who may have recorded something on the dashboard video, to contact the police; they may have information that is vital for the investigation."
The police female informant has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, people who may know a woman have come to the scene of the crime, who have asked about her location of discovery.
As the investigation continues, the police report that they're trying to inform the victim of what happened.
The cab driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police had told us that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents have just learned that they can go for hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A tearing woman appeared at the scene.
He kept saying, "It's terrible."
At 2 o’clock in the isolated area there were two Maya, and outside there was a third.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who were in charge of the apartment building.
Anyone who knows something will be asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or call anonymously to the Crimestoppers number 0800 555 111 using the identification 247 on 30 September.
The Cromwell statue in this House was part of the history rewrit of history.
It would be a poetic right to evict the statue, considering that his own fanatical puritans destroyed English cultural and religious monuments as the best Talibans.
But the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "a fool" and "a rewrite of history".
The president of the Crommel Society, John Goldsmith, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of statues would be a target for Oliver Cromwell's statue outside the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not command or execute the British Civil War iconoclasm.
The wrong Cromwell might suffer from the actions of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's wonderful description of Cromwell's opinions in the 19th century is historical evidence of a character that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, though perhaps more in the 1800s than these days, consider Cromwell as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, which, of course, was caused by monarchy in this case.
Whether this is a precise description of the subject is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
At least it is certain that the debate in the middle of the 16th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell must be identified as a character representing the other side of that division.
In addition, his achievements as a state administrator deserve to be praised and remembered."
The killer's pig's abhorred the Chinese farmer's life.
The local media report that the pig attacked the farmer and killed him in a market in south-west China.
Only the body of a man identified by the last name of Yan was found near Liupanshui Square in Guizhou Province. The man’s artery was broken and he was on top of the blood, and the South China Morning Post newsed on Sunday.
A pig herd is preparing to vaccinate pigs in the pig herd on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He was reportedly traveling with his cousin from the nearby Yunna province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also noticed that the door to the nearby pighouse was open.
In the pig, he said he saw a big herd with his mouth in his blood.
According to the news, a forensic investigation confirmed a 250-pound pack of cattle to the death of a mutilated farmer.
Guyang Evening News reports a cousin named Wu saying, "My cousin's legs were bloody and bruised."
The surveillance camera shows the cousin arriving at the market to feed the pigs on Thursday morning at 4:40 p.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the leaders of the market told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it would not harm others while collecting evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the Tori authorities are reported to be negotiating death benefits.
Pigs are known to have attacked humans before, even though it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a pig of almost 300 pounds (300 kg) climbed against this tractor by a Welsh farmer until his wife managed to rush the animal out.
The Oregonn farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012. After the event, the farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News channel that although the pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of blood can act as a “saint”.
"They're just playful.
They're like little children, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt you.
All we have to do is respect them properly," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring extensive rainfall to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to deteriorate as she moves above the cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring floods to North Mexico and to the Southwest of the United States.
The wind speed of the rose was 30 feet [38 m] per second, i.e. the first - class hurricane, on Sunday morning from five o’clock on the east coast, and it was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure is developing on the Pacific, which is heading eastward towards the west coast of the United States. As the rose arrives on the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push deep tropical humidity northward towards the Southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain into some parts of Mexico.
Then the interactive tropical humidity with the approaching low pressure will form extensive rainfalls in the southwest in the next few days.
Local rainfalls of 25 to 100 millimeters cause dangerous rainfalls and potentially landslide in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes rainfall of 50-75 millimeters per hour, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
For certain areas of the south-west, and especially Arizona, up to 50-100 millimeters of rain are expected.
Severe rainfalls are possible and conditions can rapidly weaken due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
If tropical rain is threatened, it is strongly recommended to avoid going to the desert on foot.
Hard rainfalls can turn canyons into canoes, and thunderstorms cause local windfalls and flying dusts.
The approaching low-pressure area will bring local heavy rainfalls to the coasts of southern California.
The rainfalls of more than 10 mm are possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the area.
Fragile tropical rainfalls begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday until the rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rainfall will spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
In October, intense fluctuations in temperatures can be seen throughout the United States as the Arctic region cools down, but as the tropic remains rather warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations at short distances.
The central part of the United States sees an excellent example of major temperature differences on Sunday.
Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowan Des Moines have a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees.
The delaying heat of the summer seeks to reinvigorate and expand in the near days.
The beginning of October is expected to be widely warm in the central and eastern parts of the United States, with a temperature of +26° from the southern plains to the northeast.
In New York City, the temperature can hurt on Tuesdays to +26 degrees (about 4 degrees) warmer than the average.
According to our long-term forecast, there are good opportunities in the East of the United States for higher temperatures than average in the first half of October.
More than 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's consultation
More than 20 million people watched a broadcast broadcast by six television channels on Tuesday, where the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, responsible for the sexual crime in the 1980s, gave their fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political patrimony continued as the television companies suspended their broadcast at the last minute, according to which the FBI is conducting a week-long investigation into the accusations of a contract organised by Senator Jeff Flake in Arizona.
Ford told the Senate's Legal Affairs Committee that he was 100% certain that the intoxicated Kavanaugh was plucking him and trying to take off his clothes at the high school parties.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional witness saying that he was 100% certain that this did not happen.
There were probably more viewers than the 20.4 million announced by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the average of the viewers on the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The figures of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which sent the opportunity were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring viewers who watch in offices.
Something about proportions indicates that the reading corresponds to the number of viewers at the American football playoff or Oscar gala.
According to Nielsen, among all the television companies, the number of viewers was highest at Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh’s name, with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day during the hearing.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3,1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC had 89 million and CNN had 2,52 million viewers.
After the hearing, the interest was still high.
Friday at the center of the drama was Flake.
CNN's and CBS' cameras described how the protesters' screams led him to the elevator on the way to the hearing of the Justice Committee on Friday.
CNN showed up straight how he stood at the one minute store looking down at the hollerings.
"Seison right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he'll tell the people the truth?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," he was told."
Mr Flake said that his office had given an opinion and, before the elevators closed, added that he had more to tell after the committee had been consulted.
Hours later, cable and broadcasting networks directly sent when the Committee on Legal Affairs began to vote on the transfer of Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary.
However, Mr Flake said that he only acted in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the candidate next week, as the Democrats in the minority have called for.
Flake was partially convinced by his friend, Democrat Chris Coons, of the discussions he had.
Flake made his decision after discussing with Coons and several other senators.
The choice of Flake had power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for Brexit's politics
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Sunday Times blames those who criticise her EU's plans for politics that threatens the future of Britain and its national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In addition to May's interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, where his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan.
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson as a suspect in the LSU player's death.
Police have arrested a suspect in the LSU for shooting a 20-year-old man who played basketball in the death of Wayde Sims.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, according to Baton Rougen Police Department, he's being charged with murder in the second degree.
The authorities published a video of Sims's and Simpson's investigation, where the police report that Sims lost his glasses.
The police found eyeglasses at the scene and told them they found Simpson's DNA, says WAFB.
The police say Simpson admitted to shooting Wade in interrogations.
According to Advocate, his bail was set at USD 350 000.
The coroner of East Baton Rouge County published a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The Agency thanks the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the region residents for assisting in the investigation leading up to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, Head of Staff of LSU, thanked the law enforcement authorities for their "extremism and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-metre assailant grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne father also played basketball in LSU.
He recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 disc balls in the match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said he was "astonished" and "astonished" about Wayy's death.
"You're always afraid of something like this," Wayde said.
The volcano spits ashes over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern settlements of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the Mexican Disaster Prevention Centre urged citizens to stay away from the volcano when the crater’s activity accelerated and during the day 183 gas and ash discharges had been registered.
The Centre records the noise and vibration several times.
In social media, pictures were published in areas such as Xochimilco, Mexico, where the windshields of cars were covered with thin ash.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of a volcano in the south-west of the capital of 72 km since the 7.1-magnetised earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan paratists come together before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six persons were arrested in the conflict between the protesters and the riot police in favour of independence. Thousands participated in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the resignation vote.
The police arrested a group of masked independence supporters who threw eggs and powder paints that formed dark clouds of dust on the streets normally filled by tourists.
Over the course of the day, more cracks broke out as the police used their cotton to control the dungs.
A number of hours continued between the independence supporters and the groups of Unionists, with the previous calling 'no forgetfulness, no forgiveness', and the latter saying 'live Spain'.
The local press reports that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries from demonstrations.
The tension is still on the surface in the area of independence one year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid declared illegal, but which is celebrated by the Catalan paratroopers.
The voters chose independence by a clear majority, although participation was low in boycotts of opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in last year's violent conflicts when the police tried to prevent voting in polling stations across the region.
The independence groups stayed outside on Friday to prevent the demonstration supporting the national police.
However, the demonstration was arranged, but it had to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the demonstration of separatists with his wife, said that he was no longer hopeful of the independence of Catalonia.
"Last year we experienced one of the best moments of our lives."
I saw my parents cry with joy to vote, but now we're stuck," he says.
Despite the small but vital victory achieved in the regional elections last December, the speed of the parties in favour of the independence of Catalonia has fallen this year. Many of the most well-known leaders are either in voluntary exile or in detention waiting for a trial for their participation in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who pictured the police's profitable demonstration on his phone, says politicians on both sides of the street are arguing.
"Your account's getting tighter all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders in detention since the last nine years, announced that he would participate in the European elections next year.
"Advocating a European candidate is the best way to condemn the fallout and repression of democratic values that we have seen by the Spanish Government," he says.
Londonderry: The men were arrested after the car hit the house
Men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car was reported to have repeatedly hit the house in Londonderry.
The events took place at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 7:30 p.m. in Britain.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
A few minutes later, they might be shooting at the car with a bow.
Livingston won Rangers 1-0 with Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingston secured victory
A serialist named Livingston astonished Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard a second defeat in 18 matches as the manager of the Ibrox Society.
Finally, Dolly Menga's goal was to win as the Gary Holt team rose into a divided second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew were deprived of the first win of the season in Premiership, and next Sunday, it will meet with serial leader Hearts, who is eight points ahead.
In the meantime, the Rangers will meet Rapid in the Vienna European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued in the series to reach six matches. Head coach Holt hasn't lost yet since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost places for a visiter who was suffering from a lack of steel.
Holt's team should have led long before his goal after causing the Rangers serious difficulties with his directness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finishing went wide, and the next thing I know, Alan Lithgow was able to slide off the line to Craig Halkett's push-by, but he drove the ball past.
The hosts willingly handed over the ball control to Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate from special circumstances.
This is exactly how the important goal came.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played to Menga a place where he could move the ball to the center of the penalty zone and finish.
By then, Rangers had held the ball, but he said that the defense of the home team would hold, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly could not be tried.
The same pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's company, and Lithgow led the ball past one of Livingston's special situations.
The focus on the Livingston Penal Area was constantly cleaned away, and two situations were also called for in vain - after Halkett's battled exchangeman Glenn Middleton and the ball that hit his hand.
"A great performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC in the Alasdair Lamont Tony Macao, Scotland
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent for every player, continuing through the lead-up.
The team’s way of playing and the crew has not changed much since it got back to the highest level.However, the Holt must be recognised for the way in which he has strengthened the team once he has arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was great in leading an excellently organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall the whole fight.
Although Rangers was missing ideas.
The team has played very well from time to time under Gerrard, but now it is far from his standards.
The last pass was exhausted, and they managed to open the defense of the home team only once. This should act as a wake-up call for Rangers, which is the middle of the table.
Erdogan got a different reception in Cologne.
The smile was sensitive and the sky was blue on Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been differences of opinion on human rights and freedom of the press, as well as on the EU's efforts in Turkey.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevented a group of 25 000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, explaining the matter for security reasons, but there were still a lot of supporters nearby to see the President.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan - many of whom were the Kurds - also brought their voices to the people, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
Competitive demonstrations reflect the division of opinions, and some of the German Turks greet him as a hero when others abuse him.
A road accident in Deptford: A cyclist dies in a collision with a car
The cyclist died when he hit the car in London.
The accident took place at about ten local time in the southwest of Deptford near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, where there is live traffic.
The driver stopped and the medical staff came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic escape accident on Childers Street, about one and a half miles from the Saturday accident site.
The city police tell us that they're trying to identify a man and inform his loved ones.
There are roadblocks and bus traffic has been diverted. Drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in restlessness
Prison officials report the high security status of six prison guards in the prison's restless state.
The dispersals began at HMP Long Lart prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 on Sunday, Britain’s time and continue.
They've brought in special Tornado police to calm down the unrest behind which there are eight prisoners in one prison wing.
The police's small-scale facial injuries were treated at the scene.
One prison care informant said: "HMP Long Lartin has been sent to a specialised prison staff to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken over by the police and may have to spend longer behind bars."
The HMP Long Lart prison has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The warden was reported to have been hospitalized in June after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In addition, in October, riot police were alerted to serious unrest in which the staff was attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa presents a threat of heavy rainfall to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the drought areas can benefit)
There are rare tropical low pressure in Arizona, but that is exactly what happens at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa pass over the southwest plain with the risk of heavy rainfalls.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of heavy rainfalls from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern Kaifornia and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The rose is expected to progress directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will arrive on Monday in the form of rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service pointed out in its twitter that only "10 tropical storms have preserved the tropical storm or low pressure at a distance of 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was still a hurricane at a distance of 65 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict 50-100 millimeters of rain. In the Mogollin ridge in Arizona, it can be up to 150 millimeters.
In other southwest areas, including the central rock mountains and Great Basin, 25-50 millilitres are likely to be obtained. In some places, a total of 100 millimeters can rain.
Pink rains can also be a blessing in a drought - tested area if there is no danger of heavy rainfall.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains can be useful because of severe drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drying Agency, more than 40% of Arizona suffers from extreme drought, which is the second highest, says weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first land on her route on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. At that time, it is still a hurricane with a wind speed of 135 kilometers per hour, moving north at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm loses its power when it comes to colder waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico as a tropical storm strong during the Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, rains can be severe and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"From the California peninsula to the north-west of Sonora, 75-150 millimeters are expected, and up to 250 millimeters are possible," says weather.com.
Rosa will then continue her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border as a tropical low pressure in the morning hours of Tuesday; from there it will continue its journey through Arizona to the southern Utah by Tuesday late.
"The greatest risks associated with the extremely severe rainfall in the California Peninsula, Northwest Sonora and the Southwest of the United States," says the National Hurricane Agency.
These rainfalls are expected to cause life-threatening rainfalls and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, on Saturday at 4:00 a.m., Britain.
He was taken to a hospital where he was told to be in a "stable" state.
The police report that during the night they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man in the Radstock area in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking for contact with anyone who may have video footage recorded on the mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has experienced the democratic party's "evilness and anger"
"The voice on behalf of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and shameful methods of the democratic party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered from the democratic party's "film and anger" throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, he strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexual harassment that would have occurred decades ago in their teens.
Ford also proved his accusation in the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said "the Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellence, character and courage" that day.
"The voice in favour of confirming Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is the voice of one of the most well-deserved legal scholars of our time, with excellent meritis of public service," he told his support group in West Virginia.
The President made an indirect reference to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of the Republican electoral activity in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning full," he said.
"That's why I'm circling all over to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats had given the task of "responsibility and deterrence".
The senior assistant of the Republican Party Management told CNN that the first important vote on Kavanaugh's appointment procedure is expected to take place at the Senate by Friday.
Hundreds of dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis, the number of deaths is expected to rise
On Saturday, the authorities reported at least 384 deaths following a major earthquake and tsunami attack on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia.
I would ask that hundreds of people meet at the festival on the town’s beach on Friday, when waves of up to six metres [6 m] height struck the beach in the dark of the evening. Many were washed to death as the waves destroyed everything.
The tsunami caused an earthquake of 7,5 magnets.
When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not leave immediately when they became victims of it," says BNPB's informant at Purwo Nugroho Jakarta, Indonesia's major accident relief agency.
"The tsunami did not come alone, but it carried cars, wooden trunks, houses and struck all over the country," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached an hourly speed of 800 kilometers in the open sea before it hit the coast.
Some of the people survived the tsunami by climbing into the trees, he says.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 headquarters in Palu.
Air images published by the disaster agency show several destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency BPPT stated that the energy released in the Friday's massive earthquake corresponded to around 200 atomic bombs dropped in Hiroshima's Second World War.
It says that the terrain of a long and narrow bay may have swelled the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He reported that some victims had been found in the ruins of fallen buildings and added that 540 persons had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the deaths and the damage may be higher from Pala to the north on a continuous coast, a region called Dongala, which is closer to the centre of the quake.
Communications "are completely broken, and there is no information on Dongala" says Nugroho.
According to the statement of the Red Cross, more than 300 000 people live there, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse," he said.
The Agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not telling that the tsunami hit Palu, although the authorities said that the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
In a shared amateur video in social media, the man on the upper floors of the building is alarmingly shouting for warnings about the approaching tsunami to people on the street.
Only minutes later, the beach is hit by a water wall that takes away buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't verify even the authenticity of the photo material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that cut off the communication connections around us, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue efforts.
The authorities tell us that the army has begun to send help from Jakarta and other cities on transport vehicles, but the evacuated ones still need food and other basic equipment.
The city airport has been re-opened for assistance only and remains closed until October.
President Widodon was due to visit please at evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's a really bad situation.
The staff of World Vision Dongala have reached safety in the city, where they are housed in tent roofs in the inner courtyard of the office. On their way they passed the scene of destruction, says Dosaba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's a really bad situation.
When aid teams started their uncomfortable mission, some complained that foreign aid workers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian provisions, financing, supplies and staff from abroad can only start to flow once the accident area has been declared a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
"There is still a disaster at regional level," says Aulia Ariani, the informant of the Indonesian Red Cross.
'When the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can begin to receive international assistance, but the declaration has not yet been made'.
When the second night landed on the floor after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, the friends and family members of the missing provided the hope that their loved ones’ miracle would differ from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers freed a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian hangar team, had trained two missing hangars for the Asian championships that ended earlier this month.
Roa Roa Hotel also caught his students, says Mandagi.
"As an older member of the addiction, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Gendon reports that he was desperate to reach out to the beach festival participants in WhatsApp messages after news of Roa Roa’s collapse spread among the addictive community.
However, after the messages he sent, only one grey mark appeared instead of two blue ones.
"I understand that means no messages were delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,50 in a ATM supplement in Newport on the Leve
The thieves took $26,750 from the Brink's security company's employee on Friday morning when he was completing the ATM in Newport is in the South.
The car driver had been emptying and completing the ATM at the entertainment center, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the release.
When Brink's employee's attention was elsewhere, he "run behind your man" who stole his money for delivery.
According to the press, witnesses saw several persons escape the scene, but the police did not specify their number.
People with information on their identities are asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: A rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The character that used to be known as Kanye West."
Ye has been the nickname of the 41-year-old West for some time, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album published in June.
The change is preceded by his upcoming performance in the Saturday Night Live program, where he is expected to publish his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creator of the program, cancelled his participation for "monetary reasons".
The West has previously told him that the word also has religious significance to him, not only because it is shortened by his professional name.
While discussing the name of the album earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said, "I believe that "yes" is the most common word in the Bible, and there it is "you".
"So I'm you, us, and all of us.
It began with Kanye, which means the only strip, and ended up in a shorter form, Ye, which just expresses the goodness, the evil, the confusion, everything in us.
The album is mainly a reflection on who we are."
He's one of several known rappers who've changed their names.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former partner JAY-Z has also sometimes removed and restored the connection and the letters.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use an army against civilians.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected President of Mexico, promised that military power would never be used against civilians.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared at the Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, promised that "no one would use the army to repress the Mexican people".
The armed forces fired a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were invading Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by offering monthly study grants and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training were driving young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence research
The United States should double its funding for the study of AI when China improves its activity in this field, says the financialer and AI Kai-Fu Lee, a professional in AI, Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The opinion was preceded by communications on artificial intelligence in various parts of the US administration, although there is no formal strategy for artificial intelligence in the United States.
In the meantime, China has already presented its plans last year: it will seek to lead artificial intelligence development by 2030.
"Dualising the budget for AI research would be a good start, considering that other countries are so much behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI", says Lee.
Double funding could double the probability that the next major artificial intelligence achievement would take place in the United States, Lee reported this week's CNBC interview.
Lee's book "The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He works as CEO at Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China's most important AI companies called Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University, which defeated the highest ranking Othello player in the United States. Later, he was in the leading roles of Microsoft Research as well as the head of Google's Chinese operations.
Lee acknowledged the previous technology competitions of the US administration, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be organised to identify future visionaries.
Lee says that U.S. researchers worked hard to get public support.
"Academic influences are not taken by China, but by large companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been recruiting university tops to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to step up its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think those who have completed a doctoral degree in AI should be automatically awarded green cards," he said.
The Chinese Government's next generation of artificial intelligence development plans in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other state organisations grant money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
This year, the US Ministry of Defence established the Defence Department Joint Artistic Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together industrial and academic partners, and the White House has also announced the establishment of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA was also announced this month for a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF, in turn, invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
At the same time, the legislative initiative for setting up a National Safety Commission on AI has not advanced for months.
Macedonians in a referendum to change the name of the country
In the referendum on Sunday, the Macedonians voted to change the name of the country to "the Republic of North Macedonia", which would solve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented the country's efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, considers that the name of the northern neighbour is in practice a territorial requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its entry into the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries signed an agreement on a new name proposal, but nationalist opponents felt that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he is not going to vote in a referendum, and the campaign against the vote gives rise to doubts as to whether voting activity will reach the required 50 % limit in order to have a legal outcome.
The question in the ballot note was: 'Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece'.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's supporters for the change in name make sense that the price is worth paying so that Macedonia, who has risen from the collapse of Yugoslavia, can try to become a member of both the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, on behalf of the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they respect the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive effect.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Commission, no irregularities were reported by 13.00.
However, voting activity was only 16% compared to 34% of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66% of those entitled to vote finally voted.
"I came to vote in favour of my children and put our seat in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old, who voted for the capital in Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and his son, Dushko, voted in a referendum on the name change in Macedonia in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents set up by boycotts in front of the Skopje Parliament.
"We carry NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads up, not through the kitchen door," said Kavarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, as part of European integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring the investment needed into Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that a large majority will vote in favour of change of name because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said "yes" is "to harm our future."
The opinion poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research on Monday referred to the 30-43% voting activity in the referendum - i.e. the activity required below.
In the second survey by the Macedonian TV, 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote in favour of the yes option.
In order for the referendum to succeed, voting activity must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for the Western-minded government to take power in May last year.
See, Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, won the entire Brighton defense with his goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made clear evidence of Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
At 65 minutes, Aguero made his goal look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the chart, the Argentinan lead player got a pass from the middle field.
He found an empty space in the field by storming through three Brighton defensemen.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one of the defenders and then left several others at the edge of the Brighton Penalty Area.
After that, he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The British tip used its first touch within the penalty zone to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed the Brighton guard with a shot at the right corner of Mathew Ryan's goal.
City manager Pep Guardiola told journalists that "Aguero has problems with his legs".
"We talked about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Lucky for us, he scored in that time."
Sterling, however, had already given the celestial blues an advantage in the struggle against valooli.
The paint came in with 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He gave Leroy Sane a beautiful pass on the left.
Sane took a few contacts before he sent the ball to the back of the pole towards Sterling.
The celestial assailant shoved the ball into the net just before the end of the line.
City will meet Hoffenheim in the league section on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a joy blower in a fight against Rockies.
The nations are out of the playoffs, so why try hard to get started?
However, Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to take over the pitch in a Sunday's match against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still has a playbook. They have a difference in one victory in the western series of Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockies got at least a wild card with his 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still aiming for their first division victory.
"Although we do not have a stake, we can at least rise to the pass, knowing that the atmosphere between the audience and the second team here in Denver creates the most demanding competitive position I have faced this year.
Why don't I want to accept the challenge?"
The Nationals have not yet published their starter on Sunday, but they are, according to information, inclined to give Scherzer an opportunity under these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a training session on Thursday, and he'd play at the start of his 34th match, and he'd be on his normal rest shift on Sunday.
The Washington right-handed player has an 18-7 win/loss ratio this season. The ERA statistics are 2.53 and he has burned the bat 300 times, while the pair statistics are 220 2/3.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who, at the same time, spoke about the importance of the Republican electoral activity in the mid-term elections.
"All our achievements are at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of the great -- not just campaigning, but campaigning, and that's why I'm circling everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this terrible, horribly radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They've decided to return to the grand jury by any means necessary.
They will not choose who is harming or who is to be milled, so that they may come to power; that is what they want, power and power, but we will not give it to them.
He said that the Democrats had given the task of "opting and preventing".
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "wrong and evil and evil and lying."
When he referred to as the longest Democrat in the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Feinstein, the public responded with loud booms.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
Well, no, I expect a little bit... it was really bad body language... the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a tolerant congregation.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinions
I was not really surprised when my local party Momentum activists supported the motion of censure against me.
After all, I am only the last representative of the queue, Mr Labour, to be told that I am not welcome - just because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary assembly, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because of his strong opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was a criticism that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Subjects relating to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, which are ironically similar, which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Conference stated on Friday that 'we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
The majority of the eight years I have worked as a local representative of Labour have been precisely that of the party council on Friday.
Now many meetings do not follow that tone, and a more friendly and gentle policy has long since been forgotten if it even started.
It is all the more clear that the Labour Party will no longer tolerate dissenting opinions and that every opinion will be assessed on the basis of whether or not it is appropriate for the political leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and the colleagues with whom I had thought I would share a similar political view began to expect me from a full translation and positions I would never have agreed to, whether it was national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result of the insults in social media, which calls for my choice to be withdrawn, the rejection of central politics, and I hear that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my own experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my fellow Members, because the comments that have been made to me are political in nature.
I greatly respect the professionalism and determination of my fellow Members who face sexual and racist insults every day, and never fail.
The normalisation of malpractice is one of the most disturbing aspects of the policy of this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn insisted that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with every motion of censure or change in the rule of choice, the party becomes more limited.
For two years, I have been told to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that "it all goes well".
But that's not the reason I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the failure of the Government of Thatcher to attend a single school, I have tried, both as a city councillor and as a minister, to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I've never covered my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been surprised by my views or my differences with the current leadership.
For those in favour of the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that when the state is moving towards a brexite that hampers households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy questioning my confidence in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to the Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honor, and the threat of separation or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your interest.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Unbeatable Ayr in block tip
The last two goals were slightly distorted by the final result of the match, but Ayr certainly deserved a victory in the entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team of ten who have not lost a single match.
After all, a great defence and a more successful risk-taking was what supported them, and Coach Peter Murchie can be pleased.
"We have been challenged in our fights and we are still undefeated, so I can be satisfied." he says.
Melrose Robyn Christie says, "All due respect to Ayr, they took risks better than we did."
Ayr took the lead at 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of the Scottish captain Roy Hughes, who gave to the Warriors, allowed Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo raised Ayr's leadership with a punishment painting, and just before the halftime he scored and succeeded in the conversion kick, increasing Ayr's leadership readings to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, which in the conversion kick Baggot managed to narrow the difference to five points.
There was a long delay in the game when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried out from the field. As the game continued, Ayr raised his lead with Stafford McDowall's goal, which Climo succeeded in the conversion kick.
Ayri Captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrosen Bruce Colvine scored hard after a score that failed to convert.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card about Climo's ballless battle, and Macpherson scored a goal at the end of Ayr's maul from the sideline.
Climo succeeded in the conversion kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's fire and won Gregor Henry to finish the fifth goal of the home team.
Still Game series star starts in the restaurant industry
The star of Still Game series, Ford Kieran, has been appointed head of the licensed restaurant company and should start working in the restaurant sector as well.
The 56-year-old actor, Jack Jarvis, makes his recommendation in the BBC program he's writing with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the coming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kierna is already planning her life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he has been designated as head of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment, but the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to join Glasgow's flourishing restaurant business.
"The sea belongs to us": the Inland Bolivia is trying to get back in touch with the Pacific through justice
The sailors are patrolling outside the fleet base in La Paz.
The flag poles of public buildings have a sea-blue flag.
The fleet's bases from Titicacal to Amazon have been snuffed with a slogan: "The sea is legally ours.
It's our duty to get it back."
In the inland Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the war on resources in the 19th century is still strong – as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
The hope is at its highest for decades, when Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has strong progress, joint spirit and instinctness, and, of course, a positive attitude in waiting for the final solution," said diplomat Roberto Calzad.
A number of people around the country are looking forward to the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big screens, hoping that the Hague will be in favour of – after decades of dissenting debate – Bolivia's view that Chile has an obligation to grant its independent access to the sea in Bolivia.
The charismatic president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who will face the re-election of the controversial battle next year, will be much at stake next Monday.
"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he assured in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the Court is unlikely to decide in the interests of Bolivia, and even if it were to decide, the situation would not change much.
The UN institution with a Dutch background does not have the power to dispose of Chilean territories, and the ICJ has also stated that it does not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision will be taken only six months after the last statements have been made indicates that the case 'is not complicated', says Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
Moreover, over the past four years, Bolivia’s intentions have been slowed down rather than promoted.
"The current Bolivian regime has seized the issue of maritime connections," Zárate said.
The rhetoric of Morales has suppressed the rest of the Chilean goodwill, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at some point, but it will be very difficult to organise negotiations afterwards.
In both countries, there has been no second embassy since 1962.
The former President and the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, do not accept the view that the Court's decision would have been exceptionally rapid.
Monday gives Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to end the 139-year differences with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzad also denies that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would have used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to connect with the Pacific," she added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past."
North Korea reported that nuclear decommissioning would not take place unless it could rely on the United States.
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington, says North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Mr Ri's statement came just before the US Foreign Minister, Mike Pompeo, was about to resume his deadlock diplomacy with nuclear weapons, only three months after the United States met Kim Jong Unin in Singapore.
Ri said that it is a "far off dream" to believe that the continued sanctions and the opposition of the United States to the end declaration of the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pyongyang has first taken significant measures to promote disengagement, Washington will be alert to the adoption of the declaration.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, President of the United States, want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is going to give up the armed arsenal, which the state is likely to see as the only real way to guarantee its own security, has been widespread suspicion.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump Summit.
The fashion shows in Paris present the most recent collection of large headforms, which will soon be in your immediate vicinity.
If you want to expand your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you do not need to continue searching.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their SS19 collection a selection of special super-super-heads that would dazzle the style circles of the Paris Fashion Weeks.
The very impractical heads took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have also sent their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino’s most striking creation was a beige hat with a wide feathers, which almost covered the heads of the models.
Other oversized garments included a jewel - decorated watermelon, a sorcerer hat, and even a pineapple — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks – just before Halloween.
Several colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than top fashion.
One of the creatures with a snorkel and mask was more like a diver, and the other was like a melted ice cream pitcher.
And if you want to take a stand for a big fashion, you're lucky.
The followers of the fashion predict that huge scarfs will appear on the street.
The oversized hats follow closely the "La Bomba", a straw hat with a half-metre cylinder, which has been seen in all from Rihan to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult reputation of the impractical hat, which was widely seen in social media, also encircled another large creature into fashion shows — a straw - made bag that is almost as large as the model that bears it.
The most striking creation of the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris’s fashion week was a raffi bag with white leather hand straps.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I see large hats and beach bags on the street next summer – designers have made such an impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are a key skill for a world citizen
The learning results of Scottish private schools have traditionally been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good results. Individual and community success in sport, art, music and other community-based projects has strengthened success.
These schools of over 30 000 pupils across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Department of Private Schools SCIS, seek to provide a high-quality service to their pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for their careers, postgraduates, higher education and world citizenship.
As an actor in the field of education, which can design and implement tailor-made study content, we have noticed the status of languages as a popular and desirable subject in ongoing educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes into his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language if we want to build a relationship with people in other countries.
From the latest results of this year's trials, we find that languages are at the top of the lists for the percentage of admission between private schools.
68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages reached the highest grade A.
The material was collected from 74 schools belonging to the SCIS. Based on the data, it was found that students who received the best grade A, 72 per cent studied Mandarin Chinese, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, languages are optional subjects, but they are considered to be of the same value as science (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the study programme of private schools and elsewhere.
The survey carried out by the UK Employment Office in 2014 revealed that 17% of the situations where the employer had difficulty finding a suitable worker for the job were explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore all the more necessary to promote the career development of young people.
The more the potential work needs language skills, the more essential these skills will be in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he will have the advantage of this lifelong skill in the future, regardless of the career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically puts a person with language skills ahead of the competition.
According to a survey carried out by YouGov in 2013, 75 % of over 4 000 adults in Great Britain are unable to engage in a conversation in a foreign language, and France was the only language with a two-digit figure of 15 %.
That is why it is important for children today to be involved in language teaching.
In particular, knowledge of the languages of developing countries will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are supposed to be important to the British in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Despite the interests of your child, private schools always have several language options taught by specialised teachers.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future will bring.
In this time, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be very important for the future of the country in an international business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
Today's languages should indeed be seen as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high level for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the SCIS of the Scottish Private Schools Council.
LeBron's making a debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The expectations of those who are waiting for LeBron James' first performance in the L.A. Lakers' ranks are almost over.
Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego before the season.
But for how many minutes he really plays, he'll be seen.
"It will be more than one, and less than 48" said Walton Lakers on the official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for minutes.
James, who followed the exercises, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers’ pre-games.
"At this point, I don't need any more premiere games to prepare," he said.
Trump's Western Virginia campaign time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first five election events scheduled for next week, including sympathetic targets such as Tennese and Mississippi.
As the vote awaits his election to fill the seat of the Supreme Court Judge, Trump tries to increase support for the forthcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans are in danger of losing the majority in the Congressional elections in November.
What time is Trump's Western Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
The Trump West Virginia Wheeling event starts at 19 o'clock on Saturday, 29.9.2018.
You can view Trump's Western Virginia campaign online as a live screen via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump would like to take a position on the hearing of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who became ardent in the charges of sexual harassment, who have delayed the Senate's confirmation vote, as much as a week before the FBI's investigation.
But the priority for a series of campaigns is to support the success of the Republican candidates in the strict November elections.
Therefore, the comment on President Trump's campaign was made on the five events of the next week 'to wake up volunteers and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives', according to Mr Reuters.
"The rule of the Congress is so essential for his purposes that the President is prepared to travel to as many states as possible during an urgent campaign period," told Reuters, an anonymous representative of the Trump campaign.
Today's venue is Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and there can be supporters even from "Ohio and Pennsylvania," as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh" in West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit to West Virginia during the past month, where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports President Patrick Morrisey, a candidate for the Western Virginia Senate, who has been left behind in the polls.
"It is not a good sign from Morrisey's point of view that the President is trying to increase his support for the polls," said Political Scientist Simon Haeder of the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States team shows the will to fight to keep up the hope before Sunday's singles games
After three one-sided sessions on Saturday afternoon four games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the self-enhancing force of success is a fully invented phenomenon in sport, players still believe it, and more and more in tournaments like this.
Where do they think this power of success is right now?
"They had a six-point lead position, which narrowed down to four, so we take this success force as a leap," Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has a leading position: four points ahead and 12 can be played.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a bit of wind in the sails and a lot of what encouraged, such as Spieth and Justin Thomas's condition, which enabled them to play together all day and received three points out of four.
Spieth has been overwhelming from brick to green, and leads by example.
The strenuous throat sounds of the victory were heightened as he moved forward when he succeeded in a critical set to even out the match in exactly four, when he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
The putt that they won the 15th match was followed by a similar cry that gave the impression that he believed that the United States team had not yet lost.
"You need to focus really well and take care of your own fight," Spieth said.
It's the only thing left for these players.
18 holes to impress.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Ryder Cup's indisputable legends Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
A special but sweet twin in Europe has won four out of four flawlessly.
"Moliwood" was the only twin who didn't do any bogs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way in which they give and get energy from this raging audience, confirms that they are the pre-favours of Sunday. And when the sun sets in the Le Golf National, another more popular player to ensure Europe's possible victory could not be like Fleetwood and Molinari.
I'd rather have both at the same time in different holes.
However, the talks on the success of Europe are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, who was the hero of the four-game in the morning with Alex Noren.
One bog and two double bogs in the first nine holes dug the Spanish and Swedish into a hole so deep that they were nowhere near to survive there.
But on Sunday, no one will come to help you out of the hole.
Four-ball and four-game games are fascinating to follow from a close point of view of couples’ cooperation: what advice they give or fail to give, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a prominent lead before the last day, but this four-game showed that the US team has the will to fight, even though it has been suspected in particular in the United States.
Europe will take the 10-6 lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will be in good charge before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after they took 10-6 lead in four-balls and four-games from the United States on Saturday.
The great twin Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the victory with two wins from the rapper Tiger Woods, and got the score high to four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who made a great effort to keep the victory in Hazeltine two years ago, ruled the low-played US team in four-ball in the morning, leading the match to a situation of 3-1.
The United States was a tougher opponent in four games, winning two matches, but they were unable to narrow down the lead.
Jim Fury's half needed eight points from Sunday 12 to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner who has won four points in a row. He and Molinari, also called "Molliwood", were the second twin in Ryder Cup's history after the sensational weekend, which has won four points in the first four games.
After first crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four ball, they then finished Bryson Dechambeau, a fully degenerate Woods and U.S. beginner.
Woods, who barely survived the two matches on Saturday, was at times very great, but has still lost 19 of his 29 matches in four ball and four game, and up to seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested the four-balls of the morning, but returned with Henrik Stenson to the four-game, but lost 2-1 to Dust Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked the first and third.
Europe did not get everything the way it wanted this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to the southwest.
The triple value rival Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high target for the United States at two points on Saturday.
They won a two-to-one win on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four balls in Spain, and later 4-3 win on Poulter and Rory McIlroy in four games after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team risen from a four-point drive station to a level at the start of the double games, even though Fury's side is enough to maintain the victory.
However, after two days of second best, it may be that the Sunday counterattack has been too requested.
North Korea "not in any way" takes itself out of arms without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions merely increased confidence in the United States, and under these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
At the UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that during the last year, North Korea has taken "substantial measures of good will", such as the completion of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of a nuclear test facility and the promise that North Korea will not increase the amount of nuclear weapons or technology.
"But we haven't seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be certain that national security will be maintained, so it is not possible, under such circumstances, to take ourselves out of arms unilaterally."
Although Ri repeated the familiar complaint that Washington would not accept the phased abandonment of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for every interminable matter, his statement must be noted in the sense that unilateral decoupling was not completely excluded, as Mr Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint opinion adopted by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting of the President-in-Office of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June. In his opinion, Kim assured that the Korean peninsula would be removed from nuclear weapons, and Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has attempted to formally end the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has demanded that Pyongyang first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the facilitation of the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States calls for 'nuclear disengagement first' and has increased pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal with force – even in opposition to "the declaration of peace"", Ri said.
"The idea of sanctions getting us on our knees is the desire of the indifferent.
But the problem is that constant sanctions only deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings with South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, over the last five months, and added: "If the party calling for arms to be removed were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have progressed to such a deadlock."
Yet Rin's tone was considerably different last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of missiles towards the United States' continental regions was inevitable after the "bad President" Trump called Kimi a "missile man" with suicide intentions.
Even last year Trump threatened to "destruct completely" North Korea. This year, however, Trump warmly praised Kimi for her courage to approach the abandonment of arms, but nevertheless stressed that there is still a great deal of work to be done and sanctions must remain until North Korea abandons nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump mentioned that he has no time limit: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia proposed that the UN Security Council should reward the progress already made by Pyongyang.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the strengthening of the Security Council's sanctions must continue to be strong and without fail until we prove the complete, final and reinforced abandonment of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of stifling the financial channels for the production of ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met North Korea at the UN General Assembly, and he also announced his return visit to Pyongyang for preparations for the second summit next month.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the latest visit did not go smoothly.
When he left Pyongyang, he described progress. However, North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangster-like demands" only a few hours later.
North Korea committed itself to the closure of the missile base and nuclear facility at a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month, in the event that the United States is taking "similar measures".
According to Pompeo, Kim means "similar measures" guarantees that Trump committed to at the Singapore meeting and moving towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete an adequate rest course
All undergraduate students from Harvard University take part this year in a course designed to increase student rest. The course is a counterattack to the University's flourishing macho culture, where students weigh long nights with caffeine power.
According to the researcher, students from the best university in the world are often quite ignorant of fundamentals related to their own well-being.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine at Harvard University, who works for a sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that the course is the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler received an idea for the course after lectured on the impact of the sleep deficit on learning.
"After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, "Why am I only hearing this now, the last year of my studies?"
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I thought was surprising," he told Telegraph in the interview.
For the first time this year, the course will guide students on how the right associations support academic and sports performances and improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of the Faculty of Medicine at Harvard University, and Deputy Director of Health Services at the University, says that the university has completed the course after hearing how students suffer from severe sleep deprivation during the study week.
An hour-long course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students are presented with a picture of a dormitory room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, thereby getting information on the effects of caffeine and light and the impact of a sleep shortage on sports performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
Part Two tells participants how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of a heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routines.
"We know that this has no immediate effect on the behaviour of students.
However, we believe that they have the right to know about these matters in the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking," adds Professor Czeisler.
According to Professor Czeisler, all-night study marathons are still a matter of pride, and modern technology and the ever-growing pressures of students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
"Adequate and high-quality sleep should be the 'secret weapon' of students against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even against weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes hunger-like conditions in the brain, which is why people are constantly hungry", the professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in chemical and physical psychology in California, helped Professor Czeisler plan the course after he took one of the courses he taught in the first year in Harvard last year.
He says that the course opened his eyes and gave all campus students a boost to organise a comprehensive course.
He hopes that all postgraduate students will be able to complete a similar set of studies before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler also recommends that students set a wake-up watch to remind them of the time of sleep in addition to the morning wake and invites them to bear in mind the side effects of electronic display devices and LED light on the daily rhythms, which may make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga shot took the victory of Gerrard’s players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers experienced another losing day, when Dolly Menga's shot through a broken defense led to a 1-0 win for Livingston.
Ibrox’s players were running for their first win since February 4-1, which was fought against St. Johnstone. Gary Holt’s team took the win this time, and Gerrard now only suffered his second defeat during his 18-game manager career. Rangers remained eight points away from the current leader of the Valoliga.
Menga shot the ball in the finish seven minutes before the halftime, and then, with Rangers' falling will to fight, the situation was no longer even.
The Rangers fell into sixth place as a result of the game. Livingston, on the other hand, has climbed to third place, and the goal difference is higher than only in Hibernia.
There may be other problems for the Rangers, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when the object was thrown out of the game, and the wound has been treated.
Gerrard made eight exchanges for a team that had hit Ayr and advanced to the semifinals of the Scottish league.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 assembly where the team took the score from Hearts last week. The same strategy again produced results when a well-structured composition managed to discipline the opponent almost every turn.
Although Rangers managed to dominate the possession of the ball, Livingston was better off taking advantage of the situation.
Livingston had an opportunity to score at two minutes when Menga's first pass gave Scott Pittman the freeway to the Allan McGregor goal. However, Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but another defenseman, Alan Lithgow, managed only to launch a broad rear pole.
The Rangers took control of the game on the other hand, but the final third of the game no longer had confidence in the air.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment when at fifteen minutes he and Steven Lawless had run into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian requests.
The Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half. However, the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was effortlessly rejecting the Lasana Coulibaly bush and the powerless shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Livingston's goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just due to the hard work of the team.
The Rangers still couldn't do anything about Jacobs' long feeding tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who was cold-headed to Menga for easy goal.
With the changer Gerrard decided to change Coulibay and put Ryan Kent in the field. The change affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable opening for Morelos. However, the attack interrupted Kelly’s rapid defense.
Livingston set up visitors to play their own game again, while Lithgow and Halkett continued their long passes after each other.
Holt's team had the opportunity to raise their lead at the last moments of the game. However, McGregor's fine defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow got to his position in the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who came to change the Rangers, also called for a penalty kick when he joined Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Apples: Geigermeter inventor
Next page from our "Sunday Morning" alma: September 30, 1882, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, the future physicist, was born in Germany today 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention later led to the development of a device known as geigermeter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and the meter was also the central concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "Coronado Watches", where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are presenting scientists who appear to be quite cattle shepherds:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geigerometer, used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put your headphones on your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on minerals."
Evans: "Look, it really is!
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention that bears his name, however, still lives.
A new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system ‘see’ malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system ‘see’ malignant cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
The method is used to isolate resistant cells from the patient and to alter them in the laboratory.
After treatment, cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ the typical proteins of several cancers
The dog tissue has produced promising results in patients with various cancers.
For example, cancer cells in patients with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells.
The method is used to isolate resistant cells from the patient and to modify them in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ the typical HER2 proteins of several cancers. The modified cells are finally injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, USA, describes the method: "Our results indicate that this is a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "directs the growth of several types of cancer", explains Professor Berzofsky. "These include breast cancer and ovarian, lung and colon cancer.
A similar approach – taking resistant cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West got into critics' teeth after praising Trumpia on Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on his head.
The show didn't go as planned.
Kanye West was beaten by President Donald Trump in the Saturday Night Live show and announced that he would try to be President in the 2020 elections.
After playing his third song "Ghost Town" Trump's Make America Great Again campaign hat, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated its support for President Trump.
"When I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump, because he's racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he says.
The evening's broadcast began with a sketch of Matt Damon's grinning at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing in the Senate's Legal Committee, which relates to the claims made by Christine Blasey Ford about the sexual harassment by Kavanaugh.
We didn't get West's beef on TV, but comedian Chris Rock downloaded a break from it to social media.
It's unclear if Rock's supposed to make fun of West with his post.
In addition, the West complained that it had to be treated in the face of a hat that it held in its head.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat in my head.
I've been bullied!
Then they'll say I'm on the line," West says at the Washington Examer interview.
West goes on to say, "Do you want to see what it means to be in the margin?" and says he's wearing a Superman's sign, 'cause then you can't tell me what I'm doing. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
According to Variett, the comments of West made a sound on the audience at least twice, and the performers seemed embarrassed. One of the participants described the situation to the newspaper as follows: "The whole studio was completely quiet."
The West was selected for the program at short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West in many viewers caused confusion by performing the song "I love it" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West receives support from the head of the conservative TPUSA organization, Candace Turner, who praised the courage of this on Twitter: "Thank you for being a roster."
However, the discussion programme leader, Karen Hunter, pointed out that the West "is only itself, which is wonderful at all".
"I can, however, decide to be a MADE person (by buying his music or a brand of clothing or by supporting this "art", which I consider to be supporting and spreading ideology harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
The same applies to us," he added.
Prior to his performance on Twitter tonight, the rapper announced that he had changed his name to a "person formerly known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows Diddy here, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and we also remember, of course, the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then became an artist known as Prince.

The prosecution shall be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, an actor in the throne, is attacking toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his heroic role as Jon Snow'na HBO in the violent fantasy series of the throne game.
However, Harrington has attacked the Machosankar stereotype: according to a 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned by hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Harrington suspects that something has gone wrong in the case and questions the means used to intervene in toxic masculinity in the era of the #MeToo phenomenon.
Recently, Harrington, a member of the star chart of the throne game, also married to a 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admits that she has a strong desire to intervene in the subject.
"The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity is what makes me feel powerful at the moment," he says.
"What has been taught to men in the years of their growth, which has led to problems that are now noticeable?"
Harrington believes that television and its very masculine characters are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He goes on to say, "What is inborn and what is learned?
What is learned on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel that they must be certain in order to be men?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time – how can we change this?
Because young men have something really wrong."
In the interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of the pre- or downstream parts of the throne game after the end of the series next summer, because he has, according to his own words, "get enough of the battlefields and horses".
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which is about the film producer and his rober brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting acquainted with his future Rose wife was the best thing the throne game has offered him.
"I met my wife at this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on," she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love by Harrington in Emmy's award-winning fantasy series.
The couple was married in June 2018 on Leslie family farms in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: New infections have increased by 14% in China
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens.
According to health authorities, the virus affects more than 820,000 lives in the country.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at the conference in Yunnan Province, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
However, a year later, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be common.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women due to the conservative values of the country.
Many infections result from insufficient protection in such relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised to ensure the universal availability of HIV medicines as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the data of the employee's leaking Republican senator and accuses him of spreading "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied the claims that his staff would have published personal data on the three Republican sensors on the Wikipedia pages concerning them.
A Democrat from Los Angeles confirmed that these claims were disseminated by "extreme right-wing" commentators and websites.
"Lie, lies, and more contemptible lies," says Waters in his Twitter statement.
Among the information published was the home addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham, representing South Carolina, and Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, representing the state of Utah.
An unknown person released information from the U.S. Congress on Thursday during the hearing of the Senate Committee on the charges of sexual abuse against the candidate Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, report that according to Hillin's newspaper, messages were published at the IP address attached to Waters' office and by a person belonging to Waters' staff.
"This unsubstantiated accusation is completely wrong and it is an absolute lie," Water continued.
"My employer, whose identity, personal data and safety have been compromised by these false and false accusations, has no form of responsibility for leaking this information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and absolutely a lie."
Waters’ statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, and the critics were also accompanied by Ari Fleischer, former Press Secretary of the White House.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," wrote Fleischer.
"It seems that his character is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to be hostile.
There's no reason to be insubordination.
There's no reason to question the prosecution's motives.
You must behave moderately and calmly in this situation."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during the hearing on Thursday.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is competing for Waters in the Congressional elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"I can't believe if this is true," he said.
In its opinion, Mr Waters stated that he had contacted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies for these false accusations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," he continued, "and that they will be legally held accountable for all destructive and dangerous actions against some or all of my staff."
Johnny English strikes again – the underpower Rowan Atkinson agent parodia
The tradition has already been established to look for brexit references in any film that is slightly expensive to Britain. However, this does not seem to fit the Johnny English agent parodia and the action comedy series, which started in 2003 with the Johnny English Rain and came back to life in the 2011 extension "Johnny English – Reborn".
Can the satire of the nation made in the cheek become Britain's new national export success?
In one way or another, Johnny English, an asshole-eyed, rubber-faced and incompetent, has already earned his license for a second time. His name, above all, tells us that this is a comical creation aimed at a film market outside the English-speaking world.
It is, of course, the stupid secret agent who is desperately trying to breathe around the melting glamour, but appears as a mix of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and that unhappy one-notch musician at the London 2012 opening concert.
The character is based on the pure chaos left behind by the cosmopolitan and mystical world man, originally presented by Atkinson in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
There's a moment in the latest show.
I particularly liked the scene where Johnny English arrives on a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the rotor's stage is knocking on his helmet.
Atkinson's physical comedy presents comedy, but the humor itself seems to be under-efficient and strangely unnecessary, especially because ‘serious’ film brands, such as 007 and the dangerous task now offer humor as part of the main content of the film.
The humor seems to be directed at children, and I don't think the crazy treatment of Johnny English seems as inventive and sharp as Mr. Bean's muffler committee.
The starting point that is repeated every year is that the United Kingdom is in worse trouble.
The cyber hacker has infiltrated the British top-secret spy network and reveals the identity of all British agents in the field as a knock-off by an agent in the field, as shown by Kevin Eldon's unfortunate little role.
This is the last drop for the important and difficult Prime Minister, who is already in his ears in favour of political disapproval: Emma Thompson does everything he can in the skins of the Teresa May parody character, but the script just does not offer him enough space.
When intelligence advisors inform him that all the spies in the field have been exposed, an emergency call must be made for someone who has already moved away from active service.
Of course, it’s a mischievous Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement days as a teacher at the fine school, but at the same time provides informal lessons in the nobles of spying.
English is praised for the emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he will meet again with his endlessly patient battle partner Bough, who will continue to be played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man married to a submarine commander whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to have access to his rights.
So the catastrophic Batman and Robin have returned to his Majesty's secret service to face Olga Kurylenko's fateful supercrime Ophelia Bhuletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, and the Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy claims to be able to solve the British computer problems.
The Odysse of English and Bough will immediately turn into a farce: a two - masked twin lights up a fine French restaurant and causes chaos in its secret pursuit of Volta's luxury yacht. The company will explore Volta's house with virtual glasses will end up with pure anarchy in the real world.
Even the last inhibitions of the performers will be severed at the end of the scene, but despite all the powerlessness and charm, the film still seems to be slightly made to the children’s audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
When I watch Johnny English movies, I have before come to the same thought: why is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would justify his talent?
The British Labour Party denies plans for a four-day working week with a salary of five days
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan for British workers to work four days a week, but wages would be paid five days a day.
The party is told that it requires company leaders to pass on the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution to workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, employees could enjoy the three-day weekends on the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea of a ‘party economic programme’ and its plans for a more costly policy for the benefit of workers would be appropriate.
The Central Trade Union Organisation supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
The source of the High Level Labour Party reports to the Sunday Times: "The review of the line was announced before the year-end.
The change will not take place in a moment, but the four-day working week is an objective that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers and the political party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea: the British Green Party committed itself to supporting the transition to a four-day working week in connection with its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective shall not receive indivisible support in the lines of Labour.
A Labour Press Officer states: "Four-day working week is not a party's policy, and the party does not consider such a transition."
John McDonnell, Minister of Finance of the shadow government, used the work conference last week to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from "ungrowthless dictators" and "smugglings" of undertakings of general interest.
According to the plans of the Minister of Finance of the shadow government, the current shareholders of water companies would not be able to regain their share in its entirety, as the government under Labour could carry out "reductions" on the basis of irregularities detected.
He also confirmed the plans to place employees in the management boards of companies and to create inclusive equity funds that would transfer up to GBP 500 per year to the management of the equity capital of private companies.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are discussing in their 60-minute program whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI judge Brett Kavanaugh's investigation has delayed at least a week's final vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge, and the delay also raises the question of whether the result of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republicans in the name of Kavanaugh.
In the 60-minute period to be sent on Sunday, the programme correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to find out what they could change their minds about.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carol colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said, on my way to the hearing... "I said I'd spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened when the accusations came up and asked him ‘Did you do it?’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks like a stone.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's a bomb-proof," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett denied it sharply," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"Not one of the people he appointed was able to confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old matter.
I don't see what could change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival in New York on Saturday is a musical event whose performer map is as impressive as its mission: the eradication of poverty from the world.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival attracts tens of thousands of people on the lawns of the Central Park of New York to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real goal of the event: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Power Project, an international advisory group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people active in poverty eradication.
In order to get a free ticket to take place (unless you are willing to pay for the VIP flag), the public must carry out various tasks or "activities" such as volunteering, send an e-mail to a political decision-makers or make a call, or perform another act that disseminates awareness of the project objectives.
But how has Global Citizen succeeded, now that there are only 12 years left to reach the goal?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert ticket a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘cliktivism’ among others — an idea that the world can be changed by signing an e-mail address or sending a receipt?
Global Citizen announces that he has recorded more than 19 million "acts" on behalf of different goals since 2011.
According to it, these actions have encouraged political decision-makers to announce commitments and principles that exceed $37 billion and have been used in a way that affects more than 2.25 billion people's lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations that have already been used or collected for more than $10 billion.
The group estimates that the funds achieved so far have already affected the lives of almost 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives in Great Britain, committed to "help children develop to their full potential". The group committed to providing Rwanda with $35 million to end malnutrition in the country after the activists had sent them 4 700 TVs as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"With the help of the British government, donors, governments of different countries and world citizens like you, we can pass on social injustice and malnutrition to the press," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, to the public at a concert held in London in 2018.
According to the Group, the British Government was also called upon to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children by more than 5,000 acts. The Government has published funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions asked on the website of the movement is: "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
Global citizen's answer: "You will be long and difficult and many stumbling stones are ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, such as the great civil rights struggles and the anti-partheid movements before us, because together we are stronger."
Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the New York concert this year, and its star map includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weekly, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
According to the U.S. Department of Home Affairs, the country can make energy exports difficult by using the fleet as a "block"
According to the US Home Minister Ryan Zinke quoted by Washington examer, Washington can, if necessary, use its fleet to prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia's activities in Syria – at the invitation of a legitimate government – are an excuse for the re-emergence of the new energy market in the region.
"I believe that the reason for [Russia]'s presence in the Middle East is energy transmission, just like in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe", Zinken is said to have said.
According to the Authority, there are ways and means to prevent this.
"The United States has the ability to keep the shipping routes open through its fleet and, if necessary, by encircling to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up on the world market" he says.
Zinke spoke to the public at an event organised by the Energy Consumers Association, a non-profit group that is profiled as a "speaker of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that this is one thing and the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and the replacement of fuel for another," he says, and describes Russia as "the circus number of one trick", whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
These statements are due to the fact that the Trump regime has sought to strengthen the export of LNG to Europe and to replace it with much cheaper Russian LNG.
In order to enhance this, the Trump regime, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unfit" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to President Trump binds Berlin to the Moscow recovery line.
Moscow has repeatedly focused on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the transport capacity of 110 billion cubic metres of the pipe in use, as a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington's opposition and considers this to be an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure, and that consumers must have the opportunity to choose its supplier" says Alexander Novak, Russian Minister of Energy, after meeting with the US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has led to a counter-reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industrial umbrella organisation, the central industrial union of Germany, has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that a third country is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Director of the German Confederation of Industry, recently after meeting with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, intends to think carefully about the candidate for Presidential elections in 2020.
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, in Massachusetts, announced that he would "consider carefully" be a presidential candidate after the mid-terms.
Warren confirmed that he was considering running for office at an open poll in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It is time for women to move to Washington and fix our flawed regime, and this also means a woman at the head of the kingdom," he said, according to The Hill.
"After the sixth day of November, I intend to carefully consider becoming Presidential candidate."
Warren evaluated President Donald Trump during the occasion by saying that 'he is taking the country in the wrong direction'.
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he says.
Warren has appeared frankly in criticising Trump and the candidate for this Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course we're gonna need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, according to the opinion poll published on Thursday, the majority of Warren's voters do not support this nomination in 2020.
According to a study carried out by Suffolk University Policy Research Institute and Boston Globe, 58% of 'probable' voters in Massachusetts are not in favour of a senator's nomination.
32% were in favour of being a candidate.
More respondents supported the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick with 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent democratic candidates for the 2020 elections were former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden has said that he will officially decide on his nomination by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's military trauma at Donald Trump's election.
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after she joined the armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son has to go through when he returns home, I can well identify with other families who will face the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our returning soldiers will carry," he told the public meeting at the elections in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Donald Trump.
Palin called the arrest “the hippo in the living room” and said his son, as did the other war veterans, “returning a little changed, they return hardened, they return wondering whether he and his comrades in the army and in the air force will be respected for the benefit of this country.”
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wassilla, Alaska. According to Dan Bennett, Wassilla's informant, he was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as domestic violence and treatment of the weapon intoxicated.
18 states and the Columbian Federation support the new asylum procedure
Eighteen states and the Columbian Federation are seeking a change to the new line that has entered into force in the United States, according to which asylum is not granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
The 18 state and federal representatives have submitted a letter of "friends of justice" on Friday in Washington. The letter supports infringing asylum seekers says NBC News.
The full name of the agent has not been published in the so-called Grace vs Sessions, which was raised by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy.
He tells us that his partner, "and his sons of violent gangs," abused him, and that the U.S. authorities denied him asylum on 20.7.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor, who supported Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries where gang and family violence are common to all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed the decision of the Appeal Board of Asylum Applications in 2014 to allow paperless migrants to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
Karl Racine, the general prosecutor of the Columbian Federation, commented on Friday that the new policy "takes into account the state, federal and international law for decades".
"The law of the Member State of the Union requires all asylum applications to be resolved on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and this kind of obstacle violates this principle".
The prosecutors also claim in their letter that the practice of preventing asylum seekers from accessing harms the United States economy because the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and "bring in the necessary additional labour".
In June General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges on immigration to suspend the granting of asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"The place of refuge is intended for persons who flee their home country because of persecution or fear caused by race, religion, nationality or a particular class of society," Sessions announced in its opinion of 11 June on a new asylum practice.
The asylum was never intended to solve all the problems — even serious — that people face every day around the world.
The desperate rescue of survivors continues in Palu – the number of deaths found has already doubled
The situation is getting more serious for the survivors.
"Your account is very tight," says 35-year-old Mother Risa Kusuma, when she is calming down her hot baby, please at the desolate evacuation center in the city.
"The ambulances will be bringing new bodies from one minute to the next.
Clean water is scarce."
The residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their wet goods, and try to save what is still to be saved.
Hundreds of people are injured, and the hospitals affected by the 7.5 magnetised quakes are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from vertebral fractures and shoulder fractures, rest outside the military hospital, where patients are being treated due to persistent, intense post-surgences.
His eyes will be filled with tears as he relates how the violent earthquake shook the fifth - floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I got stuck in the ruins of the wall, I think." Harris tells me, according to Associated Press, and tells me that he was in town with his family as a wedding guest.
"I heard my wife screaming for help and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador blames China for "provoking" with "propaganda announcements"
The American Ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American newspaper as a means of propaganda, a week after the publication of a four-page commercial in the American daily newspaper, which praise the mutual interests of the US-China Trade Agreement.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the Annex to China Daily in the Des Moines Register, which is the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after indicting China from its involvement in the Congress elections on 6 November.
According to the US authorities who spoke to Reuters, Trump's accusations of Beijing's attempts to interfere with the US elections constitute a new step in the Washington's expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for the foreign government to distribute notifications to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an ever-escalating trade war, in which both parties, in turn, impose customs duties on their counterpart's export products.
According to Chinese and American experts, Chinese revenge tariffs were directed at states such as Iowa at the start of the trade war, which supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador to the United States of China and the long-standing Governor of Iowa state, says that Beijing has done damage to the United States labour force, farmers and businesses.
China "is now accelerating its provocations by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press", wrote Branstad in his paper published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from the US's prestigious free word and press tradition by placing a paid announcement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad writes.
"On the other hand, there are only limited differences of opinion in the shopping malls on the streets of Peking, and real, dissenting opinions that Chinese citizens can not see at all about the alarming development of their economies. This is because the media is strictly in the economic interest of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
Branstad continues by saying that 'one of the largest newspapers in China was likely to publish an offer' in an article he wrote, but it does not specify which magazine it is.
Kavanaugh fiasko banishes female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
According to analysts, the fact that many of the Republicans’ leaders stand behind and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh can cause a counter-reaction, especially in the mid-term elections of female voters.
The feelings surrounding the case have been in large rounds, and most Republicans have already announced their desire to move forward with the vote.
"These things cannot be withdrawn," says Professor Grant Reeher of State Studies at the University of Siracus, Maxwell Institute, in an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flaken (Republicans, Arizona) in his last-minute offer of an FBI investigation by angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday and they won't forget tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior adviser and newsman of the National Reform Group MoveOn, according to a newspaper published in the capital on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang "November is coming" when they expressed their opinion in the Senate corridors when the ruling Republicans decided to move forward in Kavanaugh's appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mik reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be predictable," says Stu Rothenberg, a non-binding political analyst in an interview with the news site.
"People say that enthusiasm has already been high, and that is true.
But it could be even greater, especially among uncertain female voters in the neighbourhood and younger voters, aged between 18 and 29, who often do not vote because they do not like the President."
Analysts anticipate a possible counter-reaction if the Republicans proceed with confirmation even before Ford's testimony against the Supreme Court candidate, in which he made his claim on sexual harassment.
"This is going to be a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the National Committee of the Republicans, to the NBC News news channel at the beginning of last week.
"It is not just a question of the vote of the Committee or of the final vote or of whether Kavanaugh is being put to the hearing; it is a question of how the Republicans have acted and how they have treated Fordia", Guy Cecil, the head of the Group of the United States of America, which supports democracy, pointed out to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided in whether they should believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh as the majority tended to the latter.
According to a new opinion poll by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe in Ford’s testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% say they believe in Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38 percent say that Kavanaugh is likely or definitely lying in his testimony, whereas only 30 percent say the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's push forward, the FBI is investigating the accusations made by Ford and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified in front of the Legal Affairs Committee that Kavanaugh had been advocating him when he was 17 years old when he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate revealed to him at his genitals at a student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet as a counterattack for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup company designed to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the Technology Legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the Solid platform of Berners-Lee's open source code.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to any information.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee is joking about Inrupt's intention of "giving the world."
"It must be done now," he said referring to his start-up attempt.
"It's an historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data store", i.e. POD.
It can include contact lists, notebooks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on one browser at a time.
The unique thing about a personal repository is that it is completely user-dependent, who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "the personal enforcement of data".
According to the CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to provide resources, processes and the skills required to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently includes the security platform purchased by Berners-Leen, Bruce, IBM, some hired developers working with the project and a community of voluntary coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications with the tools available on Inrupt’s website. All of this will be available from this week onwards.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team will not discuss with "Facebook and Google whether to offer people a complete change in which all their business models are turned on overnight".
"We do not ask their consent to the matter."
In his article in the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's task is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem for the unity and quality of the new Solid network.
In 1994 Berners-Lee revolutionised the Internet by setting up the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee maintains his position as founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute, also after Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The city remembers the hero priest of World War I
The city celebrates the only priest who has been awarded the Victoria Cross medal of the Church of England, a soldier, after 100 years of events.
The sports medal was awarded to Colonel Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918 due to attacks on the villages of Bellenglis and Leaucourt.
Vann died, however, the sniper was created four days later without ever knowing of the highest honor of the British army.
Two of his grandchildren were exposing a memorial stone at the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandkids, Michael Vann, says the event is "symbolical"; the monument was revealed just 100 years after his rewarded grandfather's ultimatum.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion across Canal de Saint-Quent "in a very dense fog and under heavy field guns and machine guns."
Later he rushed into the front line and "the greatest show of valour" led the troops ahead of the attack alone to the field guns. In the ensuing battle, Vann poured three cannon batteries soldiers with his own hands.
Colonel Vann died on 4 October 1918 — only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act was "someone I could never achieve like, something that raised respect."
Michael Vann He and his brother, Dr. James Lann, counted the blacksmith after the parade of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says that it is "a great honor to attend the parade" and added, "a great crowd is remembering the glory of a true hero."
Friends of the free match waited all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – the television channel showed Pipsa Piggy
Imagine the situation in which you have been up all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and the whole event will not be presented.
There were 13 matches in the San Jose event program, of which six main series matches, and the show was to be presented live on Channel 5 in Britain.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousesi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the program changed to Pipsa Piglet for the big knockout of the viewers.
Some of the viewers were not really happy to have been up all night because of the match.
A friend of the free game opened up on Twitter, describing the replacement of the match with the children's cartoon "some kind of sick joke".
"The law said that this content was not suitable for presentation at 6:00 a.m., so they had to change it to the children's program," explained Dave Schwartz, the Senior Marketing and Communication Deputy Director of Bellator.
Piss Pig, yes.
The Director of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that the timetables would be worked out so that British viewers could follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking about a retransmission that we're probably gonna make the program work," Coker said.
"However, it is six o'clock in the morning, and we will not be able to present the programme until Sunday, which is Monday for their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their head, messages began to move in the direction and in the other direction and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix the mistake because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case; it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you this will not happen next time.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual. We tried to offer our fans more and tried too much.
This is a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
The swimmer and Olympic athlete Tom Daley say that he felt inferior to all others because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete tells me that he didn't just come to high school, that "they're not all like me."
Lauren Laverne, who spoke in the Desert Island Discs program of Radio 4, says that she spoke about gay rights to give others a ‘hope’.
She also explains how winning at the Olympics after having a child was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, the regular director of the long-term radio program, has taken several months off due to the disease.
As a guest in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "less" when he was young than everyone else, because "it was not socially acceptable to keep boys and work".
He says, "To this day these feelings, feel smaller and different, have been reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I have needed to succeed."
He says that he wanted to prove himself ‘something’ so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexuality eventually became apparent.
A double Olympic Bronzemist has become a high profile LGBT activist, and he is playing in this year's Commonwealth Games to criminalise homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he felt lucky to have an open life without sanctions and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
The three-time world champion tells of his love for a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – as a "surprising surprise".
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says that age difference has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things so young" – he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – "it's hard to find another of the same age who would have experienced similar complications and sufferings," says Daley.
The couple had a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – which led to a change in Daley's "whole perspective".
"If you'd asked me last year, my life would have been around winning the gold medal," he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than the golden Olympic medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son was named after Daley's father, who died of brain cancer when he was only 40 years old in 2011.
Daley said that his father would never accept that he would die, and one of the most recent things he asked Daley about the 2012 Olympic tickets, he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wasn't gonna be there anymore to be in the front row," Daley says.
"I held her hand when her breathing stopped. Only after she had really stopped breathing and she was dead, I finally realized that she was not vulnerable," she says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew this was something I dreamed of my whole life – jump in front of the home crowd at the Olympics. There's no better feeling," says Daley.
This was also an inspiration for his first selection of songs – Heather Model's song "Proud" – which even raised feelings when he was preparing for the Olympics and still gets his skin on chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs are sent to BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 a.m. BST.
Half for Mickelson's change seat at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The United States Phil Mickelson is breaking the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to be appalled to avoid the record round remaining in history as an unfortunate performance.
Mickelson, who plays at the two-yearly event for the record 12th time, moved to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the time of the football and the Foursome on Saturday.
In general, the American five-time Major tournament winner now spent half the day as a cheerleader and on the other side of the field trying to win.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered one of the most accurate drivers of his career, is not an ideal choice for a strict Le Golf National field, where a long-growing packer punishes impeccable hits.
If there is not enough resistance in the field for Mickelson himself, Francesco Molinari, who is known for his accuracy in the 9th game on Sunday, will be the winner of the British Open, who will play together with Tommy Fleetwood, the newcomer, who will serve as the main winner of all four wins this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind when they arrive at 12 double games, get a flying departure, Michelson’s game can prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed confidence in his player, but what else could be said in the situation.
"He fully understands the role in which he played today. He clapped me on the back, hurried and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He is one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
That's not what I imagined, but this is how it went, and this is the kind of solution we came up with.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson is breaking Nick Faldon's record of more of the Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can also mark the end of a man’s Ryder Cup career, which, though, was never comparable to his personal performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 downs and seven half-ways, but Fury says his presence brings something unspecified to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, clever, likes to joke at people's expense, and he's a funny guy everyone likes to follow," he explains.
"Younger players must have had fun with him this week. It's funny to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his contribution to the game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long a lead position can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that Ryder Cup's leading position before the last day's doubles can become a rough trip.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros, led by his side, had a five-point lead position over the Americans, but who survived to win on the lime lines at the root and just the size of his nose and won at the narrowest possible margin141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It reminds us of how we ran deep in Valderram, we led deep in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, although we were scarcely," Bjorn said after watching the 5-3 wins of the 2018 team on Friday and yesterday, moving to the 10-6 lead in the Le Golf National field.
History will show both me and all the other members of the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We're going to the field and we're doing everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we try to win that prize, and we aim only at it.
As I have always said, I will focus on these 12 players who are playing on our side. However, we are aware of what is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Happy to see how his team's players have been doing in a difficult field, Bjorn adds: "I will never lick until I drop out on such things.
Tomorrow is completely different.
Tomorrow, the priority will be individual performances, and then we will talk about different things.
It is wonderful to be in the field with a partner when everything goes well, but when the field is alone, the player's capacity will be tested to the bottom.
This is a message that needs to be transmitted to players – tomorrow everyone will be able to do the best they can.
Now we have to give up a partner who can also go [to the field alone] and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent of Captain Jim Furyk will require his players to perform better as individuals than they could as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the full translations of the last day in both directions. He participated in the team winning in Brookline before becoming a loser when the European team won Medinah's miracle.
"I remember every word of the devil," he answered the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw of the 1999 team handed over the lines of his team to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just as happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medinah.
When it moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have adjusted our composition accordingly and we will put the boys in the field in the way we want, as you know, we will do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead a defence battle and he will face Rory McIlroy in the main game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be in order to meet their European opponents.
"I put the group's guys in this order because I think it's going through the entire tournament," Bjorn commented on his two-game choices.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The latest fregat of the German fleet should have been introduced in 2014 to replace the obsolete cold war fleet, but will be introduced at the earliest next year due to defective systems and explosively increasing costs, according to local media.
According to the military informant ‘Rheinland-Pfalzin’, the first ship of the new Baden-Württemberg group, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying after-delivery problems have persecuted an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the ageing Bremen-class fregates.
According to the available data, they are equipped with effective cannons, missile systems to combat aircraft and surface vessels, and with evasive technology such as radar reflectivity and infrared and acoustic signals.
The important features of the ship include its longer service interval – new fregats should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without ever going to home port.
However, continuous delays mean that warships, which represent the top of the technology, are said to improve Germany's influence in the overseas regions, are already obsolete as they enter the service, says Die Zeit.
The bad luck F125-frgatti ended up in the headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet will return the ship after it has been delivered.
There is little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but the German media has spoken of the essential "software and equipment defects" that make the warship unfit for combat.
The software deficiencies are particularly important because the size of the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class ships is about 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bremen class.
In addition, it was found that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the fleet's ability to later update.
The Rheinland-Pfalz capacity of 7 000 tonnes is expected to be twice as heavy as the equivalent class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the entire project price tag is also becoming a problem.
The price is multiplied by an increase of EUR 3.1 billion, whereas the original price was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the use of new fregates have emerged when the German Navy has recently been warned of shrinking.
Mr Bartels, Director of the German Parliament’s Defence Committee, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet’s usable vessels are ‘we are running low’.
According to the Authority, the problem has grown over time due to the removal of old vessels, but no new ones have been submitted to replace them.
He complained that none of the fregates of the Baden-Württemberg class could have been introduced into the fleet.
The environmental organization is eavesdropping on the secret life of bats.
A new study in the area above Scotland seeks to find out how bats use the landscape when hunting for food.
It is hoped that the new study will bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and a guide to future protective measures.
Research carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland is carried out on the areas of Inverewe Garden, the botanical garden in Wester Ross.
The study will set up specific storage facilities to monitor the operation of bats during the period.
The organisation’s employees and volunteers will also perform mobile measurements using portable detection devices.
The frequency of voting, as well as the species in question, shall be ensured by expert analysis.
On the basis of the results, a map and report on the habitats will be created, where bat behaviour can be shown in a picture of the size of the area.
Rob Dewar, the Organization’s nature adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are the most important for bats, and how they are exploited by different species.
Information will help in the planning of habitats, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, taking into account bats and associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole has decreased considerably over the last hundred years.
Construction and land-building work threatens the resting places and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also constitute a risk, as can fly paper and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, due to the nightly hunting practices, their ears will be more useful in catching catches than in the eyes.
Bats use advanced echo positioning techniques to detect insects and barriers on their flight path.
National Trust for Scotland is a rural environment-focused organization that maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 acres across the country – and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out surveys, rest-place inspections and, in some cases, rescue measures for animals.
The organisation has even set up the first and only one in Scotland for the protection of bats in the countries of the Dumfries and Galloway Manor. Eight out of ten bat oils in Scotland are found in the area.
Nurse David Thompson says the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave is very good for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and overall a good living environment.
We do not know all about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization will help us to better understand what bats need to succeed."
He stresses the importance of checking the buildings for bats before starting rehabilitation, as the destruction of one bat’s resting place may unintentionally cause up to 400 female bats and youngsters to die and destroy an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and are prohibited from killing, disturbing or destroying their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Protection Organisation, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn from our bats, and we still don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers are preparing a case against a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has stamped the rape charges against him as "false" and says that people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have taken action to bring claims against the German magazine Der Spiegel.
The assailant of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rape by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid the victim 375 000 dollars for silence, Der Spiegel reports on Friday.
On Instagram, a 33-year-old footballer strongly rejected the accusations and described them as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they've said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it's part of this profession.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player kept smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing for the trial brought by Der Spiegel about claims that the Reuters News Office has called "unqualified reporting on suspicions of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player is demanding compensation for his/her mental suffering according to the seriousness of the infringement, which probably means the most serious infringement of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged case is reported to have occurred in June 2009 in the suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan are reported to have met in the nightclub and moved to the player's room, where he is claimed to have raped this anally, according to the papers submitted to the Nevada Clark County Regional Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo landed on his knees after the alleged event and said that he was a 99 percent good guy, but whose "one percent" was disappointing.
According to the papers, Ronaldo has confirmed that a couple had had sex, but it was mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken photos of her injuries in the hospital, but later reached a settlement because she was "astonished at the possibility of revenge" and concerned about "becoming the subject of public humiliation".
34-year-olds now say they are seeking the annulment of the conciliation procedure because they are still traumatised by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to the agreement to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault from Manchester United and to the Italian power team in Juvento with a 100 million-dollar agreement.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will regret forever" the end of car manufacturing
The UK would "repent forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after the brexite, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that he considered it 'to be a concern' if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, he said that the United Kingdom would temporarily suspend production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese car manufacturer says that the impact of the restrictions is visible in the form of job losses if Brext is concluded without a contract.
A factory in Burnaston, where the models of Toyota Auris and Avensis were manufactured last year, produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be interruptions in the production of our plant," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of the Toyotan Burnaston unit.
Other car manufacturers in Britain, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of leaving the European Union as to how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close Mini’s manufacturing plant for a month when the brexite is implemented.
According to the car manufacturers, the main concern is to address the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a non-contractual brexite.
The Toyota production line will be run in a timely manner using the JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in Britain and the EU, and cars will be made on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without the agreement on 29 March, it can cause disruptions at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and shortages.
It is impossible to keep a stock of more than 24 hours at the Derbyshire factory, according to Toyota, and production would be suspended.
Clark says that Theresa May's EU relations plan is "accurately calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need an agreement: we want the best possible agreement, which not only means success in the current situation, but it is an opportunity that we must take advantage of," he says in the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"Not only in the statements made by Toyota, but also by other manufacturers, we must be able to continue the very well-functioning series of supply chains to date."
Toyota cannot tell how long production will be stopped, but warns that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the installation and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and has worked as a trade union manager at the factory, says that there is concern among the growing members: "The jobs lost according to my experience will never return.
The government informs us: 'We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU'.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
The challenging meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein may be "to be transferred" to the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, due to his responsibilities on Sunday, the White House announced.
Mr Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, Trump's assistants' contacts with Russia and any action taken by the President to prevent justice.
For months, there has been rumors in Washington about Trump's intention to fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, which would jeopardise the objectivity of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported to Rosenstein on the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, and on the possibility of the president being expelled from the US Constitution, Appendix 25.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was to speak of the resignation of Rosenstein.
However, at that time President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York, so the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "not prefer" to separate Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because its date coincided with the hearing of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week's investigation into Kavanaugh's claims, which continued to delay the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump's Press Chief Sarah Sanders performed on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, Sanders said: “The date for this has not been set. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed for another week due to everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court at the moment.
But I always want to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists might disagree with this argument: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Newsman Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders says that the reason for the lack of press conferences is due to other reasons than the aversion to the "approach" of TV suppliers, but said, "I do not deny the fact that they are observable."
However, Sanders suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President holds more Question Time than any president before him," he says, and adds further evidence of the quote book, "We have checked those numbers."
"The press will still be held," said Sanders, but "it is extremely much better if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to talk to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do this many times over the past few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly responds to questions when leaving the White House or participating in open events or press conferences with visiting valuables.
The performance alone at the press conference is rare.
This week, in New York City, the President showed a possible cause for this when he appeared unhindered and from time to time strangely gathered journalists.
The Minister for Health wrote a letter to workers of the Scottish public health system (NHS Scotland) from EU countries regarding the fear of Brexit
The Minister for Health has written a letter to employees of the Scottish health system from EU countries to express their gratitude and hope for their staying in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish Member, sent a letter with less than six months left for the United Kingdom to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to cover the costs arising from applications for "established status" of EU citizens working in specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes as follows: During the summer, the divorce negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
The United Kingdom Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible non-contractual distinction.
I know all of this is uncertain times for you.
That is why I would like to repeat now how much we appreciate the contribution of each of our workers to citizenship.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie due to major emergency surgery
The supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers team Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery since the loss of the team from 31 to 27 Vanderbilt Commodors on Saturday, reports Tennessa journalist Mike Organ.
The chief coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the injury occurred just before the halftime.
"He came to the side, and he simply cut it short," Reed says.
Coachs and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the side before putting him on couples and took him to the side for a more accurate assessment.
Tennessee State's agent told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "the type/width of the injury is unknown at this stage" and that the Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays all over the team after her transfer from Illinois.
He had five fights on Saturday before he left the game, making a total of 18 fights this season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when buying properties in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy properties in Britain. The extra money will be used to help the homeless as planned by the Conservative Party’s new plans.
The purpose of the amendment is to neutralise Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase of the stamp duty applies to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to £120 million a year — to help the homeless
Theresa May is going to inform you today about the higher tax rate for foreign buyers when they buy properties in Great Britain. The extra money is used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises about cheaper housing and paid attention to good income taxation.
The raising of the stamp tax is targeted at people and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the additional money from this is channelled to government efforts to help the homeless.
The additional charge – which is added to the current stamp tax two years ago in addition to the two-bedroom and investment housing increases – can be up to 3%.
The Minister of Finance expects an increase of up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of London's new buildings are purchased by non-United Kingdom residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-rate buyers to access the housing market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK, especially in its capital city, have become ‘atrocities’ because several foreign real estate owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new approach will come only weeks after Boris Johnson presented a reduction in the tax rate as a means of facilitating the purchase of first-time dwellings for young people.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land and not building it, and called on Prime Minister May to abandon the quotas for affordable housing in order to correct the 'unscrupulous situation of housing' in Britain.
Corbyn has published a remarkable series of proposals for the reform of the housing market, including the restrictions on rents and the cessation of "non-profitable evictions".
He would also like to give the councils more power over the construction of new dwellings.
Prime Minister May says: "I was going to own the British dream of my prime minister last year – that every generation should be better than its predecessor.
This means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
It cannot be right, however, that persons who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy housing as easily as the busy British residents.
Too many people have had a dream of having a home far too far away, and the shame of being homeless remains a fact."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
The leader of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his ultimate goal is to become the leader of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is excited about his challenge of raising a team from the northeast corner of the country back to their feet. The team is currently in third place in the UK 2nd Division.
Ross moved to the "lights stadium" this summer after he had directed St. Mirren back to Scotland in the last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play on my country's team.
I got on team two and it was there," Ross says on the BBC: Scotland's Sportsound.
"As a child, I often watched games with my father in Scotland at Hampden, and it's something that's always pulled me back.
Such an opportunity will only be met if I succeed as a company manager."
Ross' predecessors include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Director of Alloa Athletic says that he was not concerned about entering his nameless predecessors' shoes with a nameful company, who has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"At the moment, I'm measuring my own success with the question of whether I can restore this company to the valoliage.
Based on the structure and capacity of the club, it is undoubtedly part of the valoliage," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably think myself successful only if I could pilot the team back into the valoliage."
Ross has only been a manager for three years: first as Deputy Director of Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heat coaching group.
After that, he helped Alloa rise from the third series of fall games and raised St. Mirren’s fall state to champions during the next season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his career as a player in the teams of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I was probably at a real crossroads with my career," she recalls the time when she moved on to the leadership of Allo.
"I truly believed I was better suited to be a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, made a little bit of money and enjoyed some relatively great successes.
However, playing can be hard.
The player has to deal with a variety of things every week.
I am still going through the same things, such as stress and pressure from work, but it seems like it's the right task to lead the team.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I'm doing it for me, and I feel better in my own body than ever in my adult life."
The whole interview will be held on Sunday 30th, Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
The perfect time to enjoy the cup is on Saturday at 5.30 p.m., research shows
The heat wave of the summer has given fire to pubs struggling with Britain’s difficulties, but at the same time has put more pressure on the food chains.
According to statistics, sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but the income from restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant company from CGA, compiled the figures, says: "Continuous sunny weather and England's longer-than-predicted participation in the football world championships meant that July was made up of pubs like June with 2.8% higher sales, while the month was even worse for restaurants.
The fall of 1.8% in the sales of restaurants in June only deteriorated in July.
The pubs and bars focused on the drinking side were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales grew more than the decline in the sale of restaurants.
Pubs focused on the food side also suffer from heat, but less dramatically than restaurant operators.
It looks like people just wanted to drink out of their minds.
Sales of pubs and bar drinks run by companies increased by 6.6% over the month, and the sales of food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, of the RSM company offering leisure and hotel restaurant consultancy services, says: "The results will continue with the trend that has continued since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors affecting the sale of the market for extra-home meals.
It is no surprise that the fight for food chains continues, although the fall in annual sales of 4.8% is particularly marked by the current economic struggle with cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come to the players who were focused on food in the worse seam, and only time to show whether the brighter temperatures of the Augustes would bring a painfully needed break in the breath.
The combined total increase in sales of pubs and restaurants, including new opened restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker is a barometer following the sale of the British pub, bar and restaurant, which collects and analyses the results of 47 sectors from a group with a combined turnover of more than GBP 9 billion, which is considered to be a reliable measure of the sector.
One-fifth of the children secretly conceal social media accounts from their parents
A fifth of children — some of whom are up to 11 years of age — secretly conceal social media accounts from their parents and teachers, says the study
A study of 20,000 upper secondary school students revealed a growing phenomenon of ‘instagram fake accounts’
The news raised concerns about the distribution of sexual content on accounts
20 per cent of students reported having a ‘head account’ shown to parents
A fifth of children, some of whom are up to 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 upper secondary school students revealed the rapidly growing existence of ‘Instagram fake accounts’, which refers to the Instagram web site for the distribution of images.
The news has raised fears that accounts can publish sexual content.
20 per cent of students reported that they consider cleaning ‘main accounts’ to be shown to parents while using other private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager that she hoped to be raped after colliding with the secret site of her 13 - year - old daughter.
A study carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Principals Conference (HMC) revealed that 40% of young people aged 11-18 had two separate profiles, and half of them admitted that they were holding secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, says, "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to set up online facilities where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilith Doyle's "sportsman's voice" to the Scottish sportsman's government.
Elidh Doyle has been elected as a member of the Scottish sportsmen's government as a non-executive member, attending the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most prized athlete in Scotland. Ian Beattie, Chairman of the Board of Directors, describes the title as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the wide-ranging international experience of the athlete during the last decade.
"Elidh is greatly respected by athletes in Scotland, Great Britain and internationally. I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit enormously from his appointment to the government," says Beattie.
Doyle says, "I look forward to my role as the sound of athletes and hope that I can be of use and help guide Scottish sport in the right direction."
Four American athletes who won the 200 m and 400 m distances at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, who are now acting as a regular commentator for the BBC, lost their ability to walk as a result of a transient circulatory disorder in the brain.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I had a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
The doctors say it's only time to show me if I'm going to recover and what's going to happen.
This has been a exhausting job, but I have recovered completely, learned to walk again, and now I am training for agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
An ad like mothers cows to share opinions online
An advertising similar to dairy cows, which is produced by a breast - feeding company, has shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, a consumer technology manufacturer, has placed on the market a product called "the world's first silent and wearable breast pump". Its marketing will be accelerated by an ad made in the cheek and adapted to the style of music videos, which describes the freedom brought to breast-feeding mothers by the new pump.
Four real-life mothers dance in a navet filled with hays, among other things, with the following songs: "Yes, I will milk myself, but there is no tail" and "if you didn't notice, they're not uglier but they're tits".
The chorus continues, "Put it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my inventions."
However, an advertisement published on the company's Facebook page caused a discussion online.
A video of 77,000 hits and hundreds of comments has triggered a conflicting reaction in viewers. Many say it is making fun of the dairy industry’s daily ‘horrors’.
"The use of cows in advertising this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and give birth so they can produce milk, but their babies will be stolen soon after giving birth", one commentator writes.

Another viewer commented: "Obviously, it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why can't they be used to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to have their babies?"
The third commentator added: "A completely compulsory ad."
The ad also received defenders: a woman admitted that the ad was "happy" in her opinion.
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I still did.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product," reads in one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (often at the workplace or in the toilets) and who feel like cows".
The purpose of the advertising is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the commercial, the women in the video reveal that they have danced unnoticed pumps stuck in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the idea that many women using breast pumps feel like cows.
The Elvis pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses and is unnoticedly fit in the breast-feeding vests, which gives women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out during pumping.
Ana Balari, a member and artistic director of Mother Advertising, commented: "Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that earned a bold and provocative income on the market.
By breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of the breast pump into the spotlight, we brought out the incredible feeling of freedom brought by the new pump in an entertaining and identical way."
The Elvis pump has ended up in the headlines before.

Hundreds of immigrant children were moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in silence
The number of children admitted to immigration has increased sharply, despite the fact that the monthly number of crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the difficulties of placing children in families as a result of the harsh rhetoric and politics introduced by the Trump regime.
Most foster families are traditionally made up of undocumented migrants, and registration as a foster family may jeopardise their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities indicated that potential foster families and other adult members of the economy had to give their fingerprints and that this information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs authority, testified last week at Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for a place of residence for minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80% of people who are either members of the foster family or members of their families are illegally in the country, and most of them are criminals.
So we keep looking for these people," Albence says.
In an attempt to deal with cases of children more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules whereby, in some cases, the case must be dealt with before the Court of Justice within one month of the time limit of 60 days previously used, the employees of the host centre report.
Many people prefer videoconferencing rather than personalizing their case in a court of law on the matters of immigrants.
Those who are not considered entitled to assistance shall be quickly deported.
According to the reports published in recent months by the reception center workers and the system, the time spent by children in prison will influence whether children are beginning to suffer from anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape.
According to lawyers, concerns are particularly highlighted in larger institutions, such as the Towerillo, where signs of child desperation can be overlooked due to the large size of the institution.
They add that transferring children to tent cities without giving them sufficient time to prepare for it emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children are already suffering from trauma.
Syria commands the United States, France and Turkey to leave the "men's forces" immediately.
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also a substitute for the Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are illegally in the country, using the excuse for the fight against terrorism, and that 'they will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died in 2011 and since, and millions of people have had to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue the "holy battle until all Syria has been cleansed" of both terrorist organisations and illegal foreign troops.
The United States has some 2 000 soldiers stationed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding the Kurds and the Arab troops that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has placed more than 1,000 troops in the country to be torn down by battles.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said that the conditions were good for return and accused the "some Western countries" of spreading irrational fears, which encourage refugees to stay out of the country.
"We have called upon the international community and aid organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing something that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria before the end of the war by political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last base of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity for political debate.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian troops supported by Russia on the territory of three million people.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has 'clear time limits' and expressed the wish that military action would be directed towards jihadists, including those on the al-Nusa front of al-Qaida, 'which will be destroyed'.
The UN Ambassador, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of the new government and opposition committee to create and pave the way for the elections of the post-war Syrian Constitution.
Moualem imposed conditions on the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to "reviewing the provisions of the current Constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump gets selected for the second season
In line with this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 elections unless, as many Liberals are likely to wish, the post and the scandal will end his term in a premature manner.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidential decision ever!"
To date, no signs of fatigue have been observed in the viewers.
Since 2014, best watch figures have doubled with CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled with 1.6 million MSNBC.
Fox News says that Nielsen has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best watch time compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC Rachel Maddow Show has reached cable TV: the top readings of 3.5 million viewers on the main news nights.
"This is a smoke that attracts people, because it is something we do not understand," says Neal Baer, the main producer of the ABC Designed Survivor programme, of the Minister who will rise as president after the attack on the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
The chaos has a lot of entertainment.
Of course, unlike other TV programs, news from Washington can determine how Roe vs. Wade is going to get to each other and how the world economy is doing.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the duties of a conscious citizen to look at the six-hour expert panel arguing about the use of Bob Woodward's source data for the Book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 oscillating pilot jacket (Washington Post says that "supervisedness is a piece of clothing") and the consequences of the unpretentious descriptions of Stormy Daniels' anatomy of Trump.
For example, I can never look at Super Mario the same way I used to.
"What he's doing seems like a real TV show, because it's partly about giving something to the public every night," says Wheelhouse Entertainment Director and the creator of the Pantillainamo series Brent Montgomery Trump's show, and the daily changing contours (NFL dispute, Kim Jong-un's praise).
You can't miss one episode, or you'll fall off the wagon.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a wonderful sunny day on the north coast of Kauai, but he couldn't go out because he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not withdraw from the programme where Brett Kavanaugh was before the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs and was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

It is not surprising that the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania has been faced with a real cash flow, as the restructuring of the congressional districts means that two of the already elected candidates will have to fight for one place.
This recently resegregated Pittsburgh constituency is a battle challenge for the Democratic Conor Lamb, who was the place of the second constituency in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is competing with another elected candidate, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th constituency of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th constituency.
The division was redeployed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old division of constituencies favoured the Republicans contrary to the Constitution.
Competition in the new 17th constituency has been launched in the financial departments of the main economic parties at the Democratic Campaign Conventional Committee (DCCC) and at the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name of the sheep became known after the special elections of the 18th Congressional District in Pennsylvania in March.
This place had been in the Republic for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won 20% in the region.
Political commentators have given the Democrats a fine advantage.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but retreated from its intentions.
The diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already quoted the situation in Beijing and the mild reaction in Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and also owned the hotel in Panama until the partners banished the management team of the Trump Organisation.
Officials of the US Department of Foreign Affairs decided to recall American diplomat leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of the "slow lines according to which Taiwan will no longer be recognised", said Heather Nauert in his opinion earlier this month.
However, sanctions were considered only for El Salvador, which received an estimated 140 million dollars of aid from the United States in 2017 for drug control, as well as development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American state with a high level of unemployment and homicide.
As the internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity.The corresponding meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in attempts to prevent migrants from reaching the United States.
However, in mid-September, the high administrative officials made it clear that the meeting would be desired to proceed and that this effectively closed the speculation on the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now expected to give the mid-October meeting some indication of the importance of the administration for the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors mentioned returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new unpleasant messages or punishments from Washington.
The informant of the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the discussion with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal matters anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also spoke under anonymity.
History Teaches
The next inevitable step may be the report by Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible prevention of President Trump's right, which is now very serious evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to investigate whether Trump’s campaign was secretly working with Russia when Russia intervened in the US elections.
If power is changed in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just as he prepares to go back to his constituents and possibly be judged by his fellow Members.
There are a lot of questions here, and I am not saying that the loss of President Trump would be inevitable - neither will the loss of people in Europe.
We must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic and those solutions determine how long this struggle will take.
In 1938 the German authorities would have been prepared to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the massacre of the years that followed.
The course of history goes around such turning points where the inevitable march of democracy is either accelerating or delayed.
The Americans are now faced with a number of such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump fires Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been polished since it became public knowledge that he had proposed a secret recording of the President's speech and considered the possible inability of the President to perform his duties.
Rosenstein says The Times's report is incorrect.
"How do we react if the recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's activities is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite the credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, do we vote in the mid-terms for a Congress that considers President Trump responsible?
If we fail on these occasions, our democracy will end up in a long and dark winter.
But I believe our success is due to the lessons I have received in Prague.
My mother was a Jew in Czechoslovakia and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, moved to America as a migrant and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on that table decorated by the hacker.
How can I have this legacy, not an optimism in the future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans as an optimist for the Rapid Vienna meeting
The Rangers will meet at their home on the Thursday of Rapid Viennena, knowing that in the same month in Spain, after the game against Villarreal, the victory of the Austrians would give the team a strong position to get to European League Section G.
The knee injury prevented the midfield player Graham Dorrans from getting into the field this season before Villarreal 2-2, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a stepping stone for better results.
"It was a good result for us, because Villarreal is a good answer", says a 31-year-old player.
"We went to the game with the expectation that we could have something and brought a score with us.
Maybe we could have caught the end of the win, but all in all, the game is probably a fair result.
They must have been better in the first half, and we got to the second half, and we were better.
There will be another important evening in the European League on Thursday.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a tough game, because their result was good in the previous game, but I believe that with the support of this group, we will be able to do everything we can and we will achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough on my own injuries and changes on the team, but now it feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy; the trainings are going well.
I hope now we can press full, leave the past season behind us and succeed."
Fear of pensioning takes women to sleep at night
Although the participants had a clear view of how they hoped to take care of themselves, few had spoken to their loved ones.
Approximately half of the participants in the country survey reported that they were discussing the costs of long-term treatment with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents reported having talked to their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the floor," says Holly Snyder, Deputy Director of the National Life Insurance Company.
Start like this.
Talk to your mate and your children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you unless you tell them about your wishes in time.
Talk to a professional person and your family about where and how to get help, as these issues are an important factor in determining costs.
Take financial advice into discussion: advice can also help to find a way to cover these costs.
Financial options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs, or self-cost insurance if you can afford it.
Legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative in order to appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical treatment and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider, too, the creation of a proxy for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to determine a trusted person to take care of the financial decisions for you and to ensure that your invoices are paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Remember, too, small details: Imagine that your elderly parents would be on their way to a hospital due to a health emergency.

A man was shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with an air gun several times as he walked home late at night.
About forty - year - old victim was in the area of Ilfracomben Oxford Grove in Devon when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
The police describe the attack that took place at about 2:30 p.m. as "a random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life threatening and the police have appealed to witnesses.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Please, Indonesia on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase.
Since communications are broken, the rescue authorities have not received any information from the northern part of the municipality of Dongala, which is closer to the surface centre of the 7.5 magnetised quake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Key information about Palus and Donggala on the island of Sulawes:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawes province located a narrow bay along the west coast of Sulawes Island, with an estimated 379 800 inhabitants in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami struck during the city's 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Dongala extends more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) to the north-west coast of the island of Sulawes.
The municipality of Dongala is an administrative area under the province, whose population was estimated at 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic interests of the central Sulawes province and, in particular, of the Dongala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Paluu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the last hundred years.
In 1938 the tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is standing in the active Pacific Ring of Fire and is often suffering from earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in northern Sumatra on the west coast of the province of Aceh, Indonesia, caused a tsunami on 26 December, which struck 14 states and killed 226 000 people on the Indian coasts. More than half of the victims were in the area of Aceh.
2005: A series of intense earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias in the coastal waters of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 Magnitude struck Indonesia's most populated island, Java, south of causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast of the island killing almost 700 people.
2009: 7.6 Magnitude struck the city of Padang, which is the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: 7.5 Magnitude struck one out of the island of Sumatran Mentawai, causing a ten-metre high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A superficial quake struck the area of Aceh Pidie Jaya, causing destruction and panic when people remember the huge destruction caused by the earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than a hundred people died as the buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in isolation.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence
The oldest son of the former Governor and Vice-President of Alaska, Track Palin, has been arrested for assault.
According to a report by the Alaska Police on Saturday, Palin, 29, from Wasilla in Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence and of the prevention of and opposition to domestic violence in the context of the arrest.
According to the police report, Palin picked up a phone from a woman’s date when he tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody in the Mat-Su Pretrial Investigation Centre and the guarantee is set at $500, reports the TV channel KUTU.
According to the report, Palin arrived at the trial on Saturday and replied that he was "unfortunately innocent".
Palin is accused of three offences in Class A, which means that he can receive a maximum of one year's imprisonment sentence and $250 000 fines.
He is also accused of an infringement of Class B, which can be sentenced to a day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
Pali is not for the first time accused of a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
That's when Palin's mother called the police and reported an assault.
The case is currently under discussion in Alaska's vet law.
In January 2016, Palin was accused of domestic violence involving possession of a weapon under the influence of drugs.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of hitting him in the face.
In 2016, the veteran groups criticised Sarah Palin for combining her son’s violent behavior with a traumatic stress disorder due to a service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake struck the island of Sulawes in Indonesia on Friday.
By its power of 7,5 Magnitude, the earthquake caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication connections are broken and the number of victims is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck right outside the central part of Sulawes on the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
In social media, there are videos of the moment of the quake.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach festival in the city, please, when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are considering imposing a rare death penalty on a suspected NYC terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the eight human-life terrorist attacks in New York City, a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state since 1953.
According to the charge, Saipov, 30, used Home Depot's rental car in his October attack on the West Side Highway wheel road in Manhattan, where he drove on pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report on the application for the death penalty in the southern administrative district of New York, death penalty is possible if the prosecutors are able to demonstrate that Saipov killed eight of his victims "intentionally" and caused "intentionally" serious physical injuries.
According to the document of the court, it is possible to pass the death penalty on both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, the federal court filed a 22-point charge against Saipov, including eight murders to assist a terrorist organisation, typically using this criminal code in cases involving organised crime, and also the charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "a remarkable design and preparation", the prosecutors stated and described the way Saipov did his work "as horrible, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, harm and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The last time the court of the southern district of New York has delivered a death sentence, it has been a decade.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty has last been implemented in New York in a federal case in 1953 when a couple named Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed sentenced to a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents of the court, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance during the days and months that followed the attack.
He told the investigators what he did felt good, the police told him.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to strike after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He responded to a 22-point charge that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defence attorneys representing Saipov, said the defense was "naturally disappointed" to the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and not recognition and life sentence without the possibility of release is a solution that only prolongs the trauma to the parties involved in these events," said Patton.
Saipov’s defense had previously requested that he not be subjected to the death penalty.
The Conservative Member says that the NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable in the Brexit negotiations.
In a demonstration today, Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the civil army.
Former Ukip leader said that politicians must feel pressure from Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians proposed that she lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, the Conservative Special Representative, said to the marchers in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be "out" if Farage were a Brexit Secretary.
But May encounters the deep - divided lines of his settlement of the challenge posed by the conservatives in favour of survival, who were involved in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep Chequers' compromise proposal on the surface of the brexite supporters and opponents, as well as the EU.
The supporters called on him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the setback - and to force Eurosceptics and Labour to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wanted to "set up the Chequers proposal to go".
He proposed that Farage be involved and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
The Member of Wellingborough added: "I am defending the brexite, but we need to get rid of the Chequers proposal."
He expressed his opposition to the EU, saying: 'We did not war World Wars to become subjects.
We want to legislate our own laws in our own country."
Bone knocked the idea that the public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British changed their minds and would like to remain is a completely incorrect argument."
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative supporter of the Brexit, also took part in the march and said to the journalists: "I say only: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, and it will not be supported by the members of the party, nor by the activists who really go out on the streets and are responsible for our success at all.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added, "The Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that politicians need to feel pressure if they are to reverse the 2016 referendum.
This is now a matter of trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that we don't accept it."
When talking to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want politicians who are about to turn the brexite to feel pressure from you."
"We are going to mobilise the army of the citizens of this country, who gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is once again an independent, self-governing and proud state."
Meanwhile, the supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before the two - hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists were waving "Tories Against Brexit" signs this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party mocked the conservative security problems they had with the party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they can get IT systems in place and all the technology for the Canadian plus plus and the seamless border functions for free Irish trade," he added.
"It's a full farce.
There is no good brexite," he added.
Warren's seriously considering the presidential candidate.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States says he is seriously considering the presidential candidate after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at the city hall in the Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
In November, Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, met Geoff Diehl, joint president of the Trump 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Warren is expected to stand against Trump in the 2020 elections.
Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th town hall meeting with voters after the beginning of the Trump season.
One of the participants asked if Warren was going to try to be president.
Warren replied that it is now time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, including a woman in the highest place.
Arrest on the shooting of LSU Sims
Louisiana Baton Rougen police reported on Saturday that they arrested a person suspected of shooting on Friday at the death of the LSU basketball team player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rougen P.D. Reported Dyteon Simpson, 20 o'clock in the morning at an ET briefing.
The police had released a video of a Friday's shooting incident and asked for help in identifying the man in it.
Sims, 20, shot near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died as a result," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through the 247 Sports network.
Wayde was defending his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted he was there during the interrogations, held a gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson didn't make an arrest for resistance, and he was taken to East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 19-inch junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 in the last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 discs per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after team arrangements offer him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valter Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that Mercedes’ team arrangements play an important role in the competition.
Bottas got a good start from the stake and left Hamilton almost his own luck in defending his place in the first two rounds, inviting Vettelli to join his teammates.
Vettel went to the fork first and left Hamilton to drive a bunch of tails, which should have been resolved.
Mercedes came to the fork later and came back after Vettelli, but Hamilton passed by after a little contact and after the Ferrari driver moved back against the inner line, giving up defending his position after two thirds of his movements.
Max Verstappen, who spent his 21st birthday, started in the back row and was the seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the competition as he extended the change of tyres in his aim of quick termination and taking fourth place from Kimi Räikkös.
He finally came to the fork in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the speed of the remaining eight rounds when Räikkönen took fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtter was doing a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he passed me by.
The team has done an exceptional job to achieve a double win," said Hamilton.
Very bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim that he did not leak to the public a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which he accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
When speaking on the occasion in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Mr Ford's testimony before the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was a sign of people's 'film, wickedness and dishonesty'.
"The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when we see anger, people who are angry, mean, mean and dishonest," the President said.
"When we see publications and bedded things and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you run this information?
Do you remember his answer... did you have a year-on-year document... oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't bleed.
Wait a minute.
Did we... No, we didn't leak," he added to the senator's vexation.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing the accusations against Ford Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have taken place in his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential according to his wishes."
But his ban was not acceptable to the President, who commented on the matter on Saturday's occasion: "I would say to you that that was very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate who was accused of sexual harassment by three women and thought that the Democrats would use the accusations for their own good.
"They have decided to return to power by any means necessary.
You see that evil and evil. They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to gain power and control,” Mediaite reports the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars applied for compensation for the defeat of the Elite League on Friday's Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had a leading position in the early stages thanks to two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to the level before Dwyer returned Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard evened Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured victory.
This was the third Elite League cut for Adam Keefe's men who won Dundeen 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
During the fourth season, the teams met three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening painting came in four minutes at 3:35 a.m. from Kendall McFaull's feed. David Rutherford fed when Beauillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the shady opening season Sullivan brought the home team back to the game in time 13:10 before Matt Marquardt entered the Cownie's leveling paint in time at 15:16.
Dwyer secured Giant's leadership for the first round break when he hit the night at the end of the first round of his second goal.
The home team assembled its lines and Bouchard rebalanced with force over time at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined their forces and Nielsen were able to make Dundee the first lead at the end of the second round. He also secured the victory of his team in the fifth goal in the middle of the last round.
Giants, who has now lost four of his last five games, will meet at his home next Friday at Milton Keynes.

Although their colleagues fled the shop, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his work in a wildly rolling air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed still and made sure that Batik Air’s flight 6321, which was currently on the runway, was safely in the air.
Then he jumped out of the air traffic control tower he thought was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia’s informant Yohannes Sirait stated that Agung’s decision could save hundreds of lives, reported in the Australian ABC News.
A helicopter was prepared to transport him to a larger hospital in the city of Balikpapan.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This news breaks our hearts," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of victims will increase to thousands because the country's disaster authorities have announced that the links with the cities of Dongala, Sig and Boutong are weak.
"The number of victims is expected to continue to rise because several bodies have been buried in ruins and many people have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo, the agency's informant.

Micronesia accident: Air Niugin says that one person is missing after the plane has crashed into the lagoon.
The representatives of the airline of the aircraft that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific Ocean now report that one person is missing, although according to the previous report, all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the submerged aircraft.
According to Air Niugin, it has not been able to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that it would try to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer any questions about additional information on the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
The local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water in an attempt to land at Chuuk Airport.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people stayed in the hospital on Saturday and everyone was stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet have both reported the plane landing in the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes told me that the plane landed very low.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to chain in a submerged plane to emergency exits in the belt - deep water.
He told the passengers that they were panicking and screamed, and that he himself suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the sailors in the repairs of a nearby dock were involved in the rescue by carrying people to the beach by rubber boat before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres (one hundred feet).
According to Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not joined the crash.
Analyst presents a timeline for the night she was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor completed the retrial, in which the man was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of data analysis.
He described to the jury how he had used the data recorded on his cell phone when he assembled the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tell and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett reported having received the location data of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was contrary to his earlier claims with Chambers the night he died, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that Tellin’s cell phone was at Chambers at the same time as Tellis claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that Tellis was lying because my car was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks after he died.
According to the data recorded on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett noted that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls, and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The final speeches on the defence are scheduled for launch on Sunday.
The judge said he was waiting for the trial to proceed to the jury later on the same day.

They want to go back to hip hop root and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have witnessed a new rise in Britain with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark-skinned one?
New York nanny sues a couple for racist text
The New York nanny challenges the couple's right to discriminate against discrimination by accidentally getting a text message from the child's mother, in which she complains that she's "as yet another dark-skinned".
A couple denys that they are racists and likens the challenge of "cryptism."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her regret when the new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived at work on her first working day in 2016 and she found that this was dark-skinned.
"EIIIII," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
But then he sent a message instead of his husband to Giselle Maurice, twice.
Having realized his mistake, the troubled Plasco-Flaxman had separated Maurice from New York Post, stating that his African-American nanny, who had received their previous departure passports, had done badly, and this time he had been expecting a Filipino.
Maurice got paid for one day at work and was sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple to get a payoff and wants 350 dollars a day for six months, for which she had originally been washed to live and work in the family, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he said to the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have responded to racist claims that the termination of Maurice’s employment was a legitimate solution because they could not trust him after they offended him.
"My wife sent him something she wasn't supposed to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told me at the Post interview.
"But would you leave your child in the sight of someone you've been unfriendly to, even if it's just an accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco sided with the challenge of blackmail and said that his wife had had had a baby two months earlier and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Are we going to start chasing someone else in a situation like this?
It is not very well done," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the public opinion has quickly condemned the couple in social media, embracing their behaviour and logic.
The new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers were afraid that the public would not identify with a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in her letter: “It is difficult to cope with the position of a person who read the book for the first time before publication.
It's fun now that Paddington's huge popularity is known."
Noting that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before committed to writing children's books on the adventures of a toy bear, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the book seemed bitter because his father died in the previous year.
Paddington "described a very important family member" and said his father was silently proud of the success he had achieved.
"He was a rather quiet man, not a limping guy at all," she says.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; one of which you are proud, even though it is not really your own achievement.
I think he experienced Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was his creation, he always gave the glory to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His daughter had been evicted after the plane landed at the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save his life in vain.
"Nad called a little bit and told me the situation was really bad that he wasn't expected to survive," says Ednan-Laperouse.
Then they called and said that my daughter would die in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you."
The drugs used by the doctors to keep his heart running gradually disappeared from his body.
He had died a little earlier, and now everything went out.
I could just sit there knowing it was all over.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and other people around me.
I had to keep myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who mourned the loss of his daughter, boarded a plane among other passengers who knew nothing about the trials he was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I kept my head down, and the tears were soaking all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a tremendous sympathy for Nadia.
That he needed my love and my understanding now.
I knew how much he loved my daughter."
Dead women send cards to stop suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones work hard to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey send cards with encouraging messages and a telephone number that can be supported.
Davis' son Tyler got depressed when he was 13. He committed suicide when he was 18.
"I would not want any parent to experience the feelings I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45, living in Lydney, reports that his son was a promising cook with a contagious grin.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile illuminates the whole room."
But he quit his job before he died because he felt like he was in the dark.
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old little brother found his brother who had taken his life from himself.
Davis says he's always afraid of the consequences.
Davis created cards "to tell people that there are people you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet. You need to talk."
Humphrey has been a friend of Davies for many years, and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was down or depressed or anything like that," Humphrey said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was in the country on Christmas Day. When the children opened their gifts, he did not take in eye contact or anything like it."
He notes that Mark's death was a difficult trauma for them, but they still have to survive ahead: "It's breaking down the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But all we have to do is go on living and fight ahead."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI commences its investigation.
"I thought that if we could really achieve what he wanted - a limited investigation in time and scope - perhaps we could achieve a little unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "disintegrate" the deadlock caused by the supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
It's a matter of timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, 6 November, and if the Republican success is weak as expected, their efforts to have the man they want elected to the Supreme Court of the country will become more difficult.
George W. Bush has grabbed the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during the Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is drawn up?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, so Vice President Mike Pence could blow the game off and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean locusts will fall during Kim
According to the South Korean legislator, the number of people who have flown to South Korea from North Korea has decreased since the entry into force of Kim Jong-un seven years ago.
Park Byeon-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Harmonisation and reported that the surges took place last year in 1 127 - 2011 occurred in 2,706.
According to Park, the key factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the increase in the prices of human traffickers.
There has been no public comment on Pyongyang.
The majority of North Korean divers will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
From Seoul it is noted that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarised zone between the Korea.
China treats divers as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and most of the time they are forced to return them.
Further, technically speaking, relations between North Korea and South Korea in the war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang and the discussions focused on the negotiations that were on the halt.
This followed the historic meeting in June, where US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-u met in Singapore and agreed on a general approach towards the Korean peninsula's nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of falling apart after the meeting.
"Without any confidence from the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis, and under such circumstances we will certainly not begin unilaterally to dispose of our equipment first," Ri said to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy your fear calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
Director of Minority Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said it was temporarily inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
Your fear commented at a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called "hysterical"," said Pelosi of her own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Legal Affairs Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied accusations that he was sexually harassed by Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in emotional power and sometimes he almost cried out and lost his ability to speak when he told about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the democratic members of the committee without calling himself "the grotesque and planned persecution against a person", organised by the Liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Your fear said that he believed Kavanaugh's testimony to show that he is unable to act in the Supreme Court because it showed that he is partial to the Democrats.
"I believe that he made himself incompetent with his statements and in the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," said Pelosi.
Your fear wondered when he was asked if he would press charges against Kavanaugh if his choice were confirmed and if the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
"Let's say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he's currently working," said your Fear.
Kavanaugh is currently working at the U.S. Federal Court of Appeal.
Your fear added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possible provisions of Kavanaugh on health reform or Roe v Wade, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative court-holder.
In the consultations relating to its confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the right time for a hysterical and partial person to be elected a member of the court and we would expect to say that it is wonderful," said Pelosi.
Women have to make it through everything.
It is a legitimate fire speech with months and years of rage, and he cannot keep it unscrupulous.
"We cry when we're angry," Miss Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
He continued: "I was helped enormously by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she was also crying when she got angry, but that she had developed a way of saying to her speechmate in a situation where she got angry and started crying, "You might think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I'm really mad."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are justified as a way of breaking out rage, although they are generally misunderstood in a fundamental sense.
One of my most memorable memories of my early job in the male-dominated office is when I cried out of rage and an older woman, a cold-shoeed supervisor, who I had always been a little afraid of, grabbed me off my neck and pulled me into the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and then they're happy because they've been hurt by your mind."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democrat Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on this presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an out-of- wedlock relationship on a Monkey Business boat and got out of the race, it was a very frustrated Schroeder feeling that there was no reason why he would not try to be president himself.
"It was not a well thought-out decision," he said to me, laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates, and at least one more was needed.
Someone called the situation ‘The Snow and the Seven Dwarves.’
Since the campaign period was long enough, he was behind the fund-raiser, and so he announced that he would not go to the race if he did not have $2 million in total.
It was a lost battle.
He learned that some of his supporters, who gave the male candidates a thousand dollars, gave him only 250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" he thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he was placed under the influence of his feelings - of gratitude for his supporters, of the frustration of the system that made it so difficult to raise funds for election work against voters and delegates, and of hatred for sexism - that he was unable to speak.
"I could've thought I'd get a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
"You could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tombstone would probably be cut into a memoir.
‘He cried.’
How the United States and China Can Benefit Beijing
The opening up of the US-China trade war was an ear drug, and although the fight is nothing but over, a country break can benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on the main Chinese export items, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week, the most significant escalation took place with new customs duties affecting import goods worth 200 billion dollars (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all products imported from China to the USA.
Beijing has responded on the same scale every time, last from five to ten percent by imposing customs duties on American imports worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye-to-eye style, and it does not seem that the second largest economic power in the world is on its way for even a moment.
To get Washington back, we should give in to our own demands, but public worship to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts note that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing interdependence between countries.
"The long political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that start the economic downturn in one of the countries and this is in fact a more dangerous opportunity than bystanders have so far understood," says Abigail Grace, an Asian research assistant at the Center for New American Security.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is "ready" to return refugees
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in the reconstruction of the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
In speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country would improve.
"Your account is now more stable and safer as a result of developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
The circumstances now make it possible for refugees to return voluntarily to the country from which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and their unilateral economic activities on their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian Government would be grateful for the help it has given in the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that the government would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the rebels.
The European team confirmed Ryder Cup's victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup in the finals of the US team at 16.5 against 10.5 in the Le Golf National field outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe, which has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team kept the crown to itself when its Danish Captain Thomas Bjørn’s team reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star player Phil Mickelson was having trouble almost the entire tournament and he hit his start in the water on the 16th hole of the par-3-track, giving Francesco Molinar a match.
The Italian Molinari shined in all the rounds and became one of the four players who scored 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth came out with a result of 5&4 against the lowest-ranking player of the European team, the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, the world’s top player, lost results of 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European in all time, with a total of 25.5 careers.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a heavy year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win this victory.
It is a team, and I am glad that I could help," said the touched Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He transfers the torch to his countryman Jon Rahm, who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in the 2&1st Sunday singles competitions.
"I feel a lot of pride after winning Tiger Woods, and I grew up admiring him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds Ryder Cup record 13-21-3.
Strange statistics from one of the best players of all time who have won 14 big wins and will only be left to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding the routes throughout the weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, whose game was high-level throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the United States team said after the failed performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We put pressure on the European team in this morning's games.
We got him.
Honor to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're regrouping, working with our American PGA and Ryder Cup Committee, and we're moving on.
These 12 guys are great, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I've got to get my hat up.
We met our winner."
