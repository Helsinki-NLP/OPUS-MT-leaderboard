Found a 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere
The police have had a search mission for a nine-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday night.
The disappearance report on a boy who left West Tampere with his friend has spread in social media.
According to the police station, we've got contact with the boy, and he's got no danger of life and health.
The son's father told the evening-Sanom, knowing he was found.
He's fine, and now we're starting the follow-up.
The boy was found in the neighborhood, so my dad told me.
Ronaldo's wild again, tearing the painting apart at Mess.
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish League during the weekend and continued his work in the Masters League.
The fight between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo from the Masters League's goaldom turned for at least a moment.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved to the top of all-time scorer statistics alone when he shot the visitor Shahtar Donetski's network with two hits on the penalty kicks and one on the gambling situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when the Barcelona Messiah, who was on a level with him before Tuesday, had 77 hits.
Real won the 4-0.
Juventus has been stumbling in the Italian football league in Serie A since the beginning, but in the Champions League section D, he started with a two-to-one win in Manchester City.
The victory goal was won over ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack bore Sergei Aguero with a knee-jerk.
The Aguero who was injured during the week in the semi-final game only arrived at the airport in the last ten minutes.
The Second Manchester Society also suffered severe in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering 1-2 losses.
The 20-year-old manU law-enforcementist Luke Shaw's guest fight only took a quarter an hour.
The dangerous look of Hector Moreno's PSV hit the manU pack so badly that Shaw was likely to break his leg.
Shaw was lying on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium ten minutes before the medical staff left to take him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to 1-0 in 41st minute, but ManU's pleasure lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened out before the break at an extra time.
In the second half of the year, the winner of the PSV was Luciano Narsingh.
In the Masters League of the Painting season, section A was started by Paris Saint-Germain.
It was Angel Di Maria of Argentina who changed Manchester United's shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through right and lifted Johan Wiland, the goaltender of Malmo to the back corner of the ball.
Edinson Cavani did 2-0 for the second half of PSG.
PSG has been bet on the success of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's long-term euro, is not the best benchmark.
For the first time, Ibrahimovic, the star of PSG, met Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmo in 1999.
Roman Ermenko played 90 minutes after his team lost 0-1 to Wolfsburg in the B-section match in Germany.
The opposition party immediately called for a divorce. The president gave the wrong speech.
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, has again given the same speech in Parliament as he gave at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech Mugabe apparently didn't realize the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is fully alive.
The MDC, the main opposition party, called on Mugabe to resign, because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants rushed to say that the confusion had only taken place in Mugabe’s staff and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mr Mugabe's speech addressed the impact of China on the country's economy earlier and now.
Germany and Austria want an extra summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an extraordinary summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, will assess the request.
According to the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
The negotiations on the quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, at the Minister of Interior's table.
The teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during an emergency call.
The voice just a little colored university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during the emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "gold dog" was alive and probably shocked, and said that contact details of the loved ones of the dead woman were found on his phone.
Inside the house, the police found a message from Amy Prentiss's body and a note written on the page: "I'm so sorry I could cancel this lover Amy and she's the only woman who's ever loved me," said a letter from experts that says is signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Delta State University of Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus, where the police believe that he shot and killed the held history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this office.
Lynn Buford, head of police at Delta State University, told the university staff about the shooting at 10:18 p.m.
He said that Lamb called a fatal emergency call for a while after that.
By the end of the day, the number of the dead rose one more: Lamb committed suicide while the police surrounded the mother - in - law.
The authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb’s motives the day after the students and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of the shooting at school.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, but that may have had problems.
The students said they'd been waiting for his lessons.
Prentiss's death scene, Gautier, police say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in his book, in which he thanked the "mighty people" with whom he shared the academic life.
Both were taught by the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended the courses of both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said that he also seemed nervous and anxious, "as if something had been wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he was under a lot of stress at the end of 2014-15.
She had previously asked for a sick leave from Delta State University, saying that she had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university pay principles meant that even though Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and assistant professorship.
The university's principal, William LaForge, said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, as far as he knew, but that there was clearly something in Lamb's mind.
These questions are no longer answered by Lamb.
After Lamb fled the campus, the police caught up with him when he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before being arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Mississippi Greenville, reports Methel Johnson, D.C.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this very house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived there.
The sheep grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught geography and educational sciences. The University has 3500 students and is located in a city with approximately 12 000 inhabitants.
She did her doctoral degree in education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and fun.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a fun, older guy who tried to teach Hairston to play guitar for many years.
He was quite a charmer in those days.
All the girls were molten while he was there, now told by 40-year-old Hairston who lives in the Jackson suburbs of Brandon.
Apparently, Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a riverside brick house in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me they broke up 15 years ago, but he stayed friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
She was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me she hadn't met Lamb, but she had heard from her daughter, Abigail, that she was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together on some gigs.
O'Steen told me that his daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
The bartender and occasional entertainment director Mike Shaffer of the shady bar near Gautier tells that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the 5th of September after Lamb had finished his guitar and lip harp performance for a few audiences.
Nothing seemed wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were playing around and throwing shit at each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
The dead teacher Schmidt led the first year of students' seminar program and was specializing in Indians and colonial history, reported the school's English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three little children.
He studied at Kansas Empire State University and was chairman of his brotherhood and student government.
On Tuesday evening in Cleveland, Delta State campus, there was a candle attack involving around 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the fair during which the University Choir sang songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Mississippi Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus of Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that the police are now saying that Lamb made an emergency call since Schmidt was shot, and that even though during the call I referred to Prentiss as his wife, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that it does not hire as many employees as last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that current regular and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to spend more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40 000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, with 45 000 people employed during the 2014 holiday period.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
The company said that the interviews of applicants will start this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Although there are months of holiday time, the Christmas season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to assist in the occupation of stores and in the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of the film Return to the Future was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox, a professionally important one.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat at the theater waiting for the Royals to arrive, and I realized that I was sitting next to me empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," she said in a future documentary back in Time's trailer.
The film begins and I think I'm just a fake catch and a hand stretch away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a document about the Back to the Future film that was interviewed with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and CEO Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future got its premiere 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "I doubt it's the greatest time travel movie of all time."
Back in Time is available in order video, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
The UN Director says that the situation in Syria will not be resolved by armed means.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's answer to the fact that Russia is increasing military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict "will not be resolved in arms", and the additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader once again called on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to join and support no non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At the Wednesday press conference, Mr Ban told us that he intends to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the Ministerial Week of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted the fact that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional forces "has made it impossible to resolve the situation."
Mr Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate, in dealing with the Syrian crisis, the solidarity and consensus they demonstrated when agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 Support Surveys that show Donald Trump is serious
Some people have been trying to label him as the windmill.
Some people just think he's a joke.
Some of them are waiting for the crash.
Although some Republicans have tried to slow down Donald Trump from the top of the support polls, it has not (yet) succeeded.
Of the latest 11 national surveys in ten Donald Trump has been in charge in the two-digit century, some have started to seriously consider what this means for the real estate king's appointments.
Of course, the election is only in the early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
In 2011 Rick Perry was losing its leading position in the rising Herman Cain, both of which received no state in the appointment process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in public elections.
However, external groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic association Club for Growth, have noticed Trump's tenacity and started to use his funds to overthrow him.
The following recent survey results suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's popularity figures have made a full translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, the support polls at Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Currently, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten people say they're negative.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
Last week, 60 percent of Republicans in Iowa, the University of Quinn, reported that they welcomed Trump.
Two thirds of Republican voters would be pleased if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week 67% of Republicans said that they would be either "inspired" or "satisfy" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they'd be upset if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson achieves the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43%) vs. Trump.
Next up, the most enthusiastic?
Marco Rubio only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republican voters would be 'unsatisfied' or 'dejected' if Jeb Bush became the candidate for the popular Jeb Bush.
The fiery nature of Trump is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpia has been widely criticised for his grandiose speeches and insults, according to the Monday's ABC News/Washington Post survey, 52% of the voters on the Republican side at national level think that the real estate king has the right character for the President.
According to a survey conducted by the Quinn Market last week in the State of Iowa holding the first party meeting, the figure is the same: 52% of Republicans think Trump has the right character for the leader.
However, according to the ABC/Post poll, 44% think that his character is not suitable for acting as President, and almost six out of ten think that his character is not part of the White House.
The Republican voters are accustomed to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real alternative.
According to the CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump to be the most likely option to ask who most likely is to be appointed as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Information release: Republican voters have not always had the clearest possible crystal ball at their disposal.
During the last parliamentary term, four out of ten Republicans at this time agreed that Rick Perry would be appointed as a candidate, and only 28% of the final candidate, Mitt Romney, was in favour.
In any case, this shows that most of the Republican voters consider Trump's campaign credible.
Even if the Republicans stood up for another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that a fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump’s leadership, as anti- Trump support is divided among many other candidates.
However, a survey carried out by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in the hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives a majority in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He's on the same page with Ted Cruz.
The only winner of Trump?
If they were opposited, Ben Carson would win Trump with a big 18-point difference.
The majority of Donald Trump's supporters have just said that they have made a decision.
The new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters in favour of Trump have decided who their vote is going to be.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say for sure that they would never change their mind.
46% said that they might be able to change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made a decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapers" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some people are concerned that Trump’s mightiness drives Latin voters further away from the Republican Party and harms rebranding attempts.
According to the new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
The futility of the government has reached a new peak.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely due to their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said on Monday in the ABC/Post survey that they prefer to choose a non-political person rather than one with government experience.
They're also mad at the federal government.
A survey of Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg two weeks ago showed that three of the four Republicans of Iowa are frustrated with the Republicans in Congress: 54% are "unsatisfied" and 21% are "truely angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first performance in Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance in Question Time has been eagerly expected since his choice.
The new director of the Labour Labour Party, Jeremy Corby, will meet David Cameron for the first time in Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn rises to ask about his first six questions shortly after noon, and probably both the media and the Labour Party's representatives were watching closely for his performance.
Corbyn has insisted on this weekly show "less theatre and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave some opportunities to his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and he spoke at the annual meeting of the trade union organisation on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the Labour Director to stand silently during the National Song in the Memorial Service of Tuesday, organised on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the British Air War, has raised criticisms of the Conservative Party's representatives and has appeared in many front-page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing national songs has attracted attention
Corbyn's representative said his "supervisedly silent" and that he admits the "sport of the Royal Air Force in the Great Britain's Air War."
A member of the Corbyn shadow government, Owen Smith, said to the BBC Two Newsnight program that he would have invited the Labour Director to sing a national song, despite his view that the Royal House should be terminated.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to take part in Corbyn's inner circle, relying on differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs, originally supported by less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party.
The BBC Policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the differences in policy regarding the role of the party in the European Union and the Government's ceiling on aid have also been "accumulated" within the Labour Party since the appointment of Corbyn.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the Trade Union Confederation that the Labour Party is proposing a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, Mr Smith, Secretary for Labour and Pensions of the shadow government, said that the party was "very clear" in that they were only opposed to the government's plans to drop the ceiling from £26 000 to £23 0000.
Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party met by David Cameron during the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and is now telling us that he has "massaged" ideas for the Prime Minister and has received more than 30 000 proposals.
Islington North, Member of the Commission, Corbyn, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too controversial and that he intends to refrain from both clever words and poke, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the Secretary of Finance of the shadow government, will replace him in Question Time when Corby is not involved - for example when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues should also be allowed to speak, and he has said that he has approached the president of the House, Mr Bercowi, from the groups involved.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said that he wanted to move away from a political theater that is often combined with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but he later had to admit that he had failed.
Since they began to be televisiond in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure of how to assess the Director's judgment, the management of his lower chamber, and his position with other Members of the House, even though the critics have criticised Question Time for becoming merely a gloomy image that requires far-reaching reforms.
Described in Joburg: Homeless young people are trained as photographers
It's a difficult place to be homeless from downtown Johannesburg.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photographs of their neighborhood and get profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people who graduated from the project.

The value of the pound increases as the United Kingdom's wage growth increases
The value of the pound jumped upwards after the figures showed an increase in the UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMILLER.
Between May and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was fastest after 2009 and was considered to be bringing estimates of the rise in the exchange rates.
The pound rose by more than one per cent to $1,505 and 0.84 per cent to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49 per cent to 6229.21.
SABMILLer was the most distinct share in the market and rose by 20 % after the competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share rose by 0.9 per cent after the encouraging news from the competing luxury group Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is the key market for Burberry - had started to increase again.
Glencore’s shares rose by 5 percent after the mining waste reported that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt - cutting strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mond's shares were the largest figures in the index 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed his recommendation from company to "sales".
JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports clothing company released information on its six-monthly return before taxes: 83 per cent up to GBP 46.6 million.
According to the director of JD Sports, higher wages can damage enlargement
Peter Cowgill, Director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for employees is raised in the UK, it may mean that "the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase".
However, this purchasing power is not likely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, Cowgill states.
The costs could be targeted at the company's enlargement plans, he added, which would mean less more jobs.
Metcash will launch a grass-root campaign against the invasion of Ald's area.
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Ald's attack in South and West Australia.
The wholesaler of food, Metcash, has launched a grass roots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before Aldin's $700 million attack.
At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food providers and build an IGA brand through the marketing of mainstream and social media and through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA traders and buyers have jumped in, and brands such as Simmo's, an ice cream manufacturer from Dunsborough, offer flavors in IGA stores, and shop owners sell discount tickets to Australian football matches for their regular customers.
Metcashi is expected to reveal more details of his defence strategy on 29 September, when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and iron goods organises an annual investor's strategy day.
There is a great deal at stake, as South and West Australia together account for almost 30% of the area of Metcashi IGA stores, with profit margins higher than those of the IGA network of the Eastern States of Metcashi.
People who shop in South and West Australia are well known for being in the corner, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 % in the south and 24 % in the west compared to 14 % in the east.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will catch around 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first movements.
In its report this week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers can lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash can lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 in the south and 30 in the west, resulting in a turnover of 500 and 600 million dollars in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcashi's high fixed costs base can cost Metcash around $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although the recent study of Roy Morgan found that IGA’s customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi's food and food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016, by 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018 so that its market share will fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the leading investment fund and founder of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, said at business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "well possibly lose in a decade".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcashi Government would have contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has fallen from 18% to 14%, and revenues from Metcashi’s food and food business, which delivers products to around 1200 IGA dealers, have decreased by 43% since 2012, reflecting a reduction in the debt financing of activities when pressure is placed on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is in favour and has invested more than $150 million a year in the weekly fall in prices of hundreds of products to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers to renovate shops by adding faster-growing fresh food and bringing a better range of private brand products to the market.
Ian Morrice, Director General of Metcashi, says that the calculation of prices and the improvement of stores have increased the attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, chairman of the Australian tennis union, supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasis Kokkinakis deserves honor rather than criticism of his conduct.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered as a sider in a recent storm that has been raging around his friend Nick Kyrgyus. He deserves honor rather than criticism of his own behavior, says Steve Healy, Chairman of the Australian tennis union.
The younger member of the talented twin called "Special Ks", Kokkinakis, was unwittingly exposed to a case where Kyrgyos provoked Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal Masters competition.
Soon thereafter, in a fiery fight in Cincinnati, the chief judge had to separate Kokkinakis from his opponent Ryan Harrison twice when Harrison declared: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that kid."
Even though Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his bat after the cramp ruined his possible victory over Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been the untenable defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, a young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth from another place in doubles with Bernard Tomic at the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I think quite strongly that your Thana's just been dragged into trouble," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he was losing because of the cramp in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat when he's frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved perfectly well, even in quite provocative situations in the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a nice family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He is very mature by the age of 19, he works hard, fits into the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he is working hard, he is in good condition and he is quite calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged according to his merit.
Healy has also supported the decision not to join the important games starting on Friday, describing this "joint decision" as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the Canberran return to the team's permanent equipment.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games and not on everything around [Cyrrios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he is growing up in the public, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of the public debate these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border against Serbia, with the aim of blocking the flows of migrants who came to the country illegally.
There was chaos at the border when hundreds of immigrants gathered in an neutral area, and the Serbian authorities reacted with shock.
The people who fled the violence of their own countries have now erected their tents and settled on the road section between the inspection stations in the two countries for an indefinite period.
However, vanity increased.
While the police helicopter stayed above them, immigrants said, "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water for protest.
The Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs declared that it is 'unacceptable' for migrants to return from Hungary, as they continue to come from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, no harm to civilians.
The debate must take place in the next few days with other countries and Brussels," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The confusion at the Hungarian-Serbia border arose after the failure of the 28th Nationality Group to establish a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibilities for 40 000 people seeking asylum, who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and ministers were hopeful to talk about reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take 120 000 additional refugees, including some of Hungary.
On Tuesday, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an extraordinary EU summit to discuss the migration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will work in the near future.
The emergency situation on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in a crisis and enabled you to be closed and asylum cases can be speeded up.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is ready, the country will also set up a barbed wire fence on the border with Romania to stop the flood of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finish the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and point of entry into the European Union for refugees, many of whom are at war from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are seeking a better life for economic refugees, and not those who are entitled to protection under war - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary now define the attempt to cross or damage a 4-metre fibre fence built by the government on the southern border against Serbia and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"As a result of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government is declaring an emergency", the government's informant, Zoltán Kovacs, told journalists in the southern town of Szeged.
We are very clear here: crossing the illegal border is a crime.
Parliament still needs to formally accept the military deployment expected next week, but Associated Press journalists at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakongi, a security adviser from Orban’s home country, said that the authorities had captured 45 people in their efforts to cross the border and 15 people in their own country.
They got over by hurting the fence, now being imprisoned by the police, and charged with violations defined in the new laws.
The authorities will correct the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points off the border with Serbia after sending a train wagon covered with barbed wire to close one of these places.
The main border crossing point near Roszkea in Hungary was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and the crowd tried to infiltrate them.
About 20 of them got in, but thousands were left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 elections: According to a national survey, Hillary Clinton's leadership in Bernie Sanders has narrowed on the side
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue in a two-digit lead in the Democratic Nomination Competition, but Senator Bernie Sanders will blackmail him.
Clinton now supports 47% of democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders, on the other hand, supports 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he is going to join the presidential competition, but he is supported by 15% of the democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the pre-election, the majority of the Democrats say that it is too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
However, Clinton’s supporters stand behind their choice more firmly than the other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has fallen among several population groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge with women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed down.
His popularity among men has decreased considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's head starter in a group of democracies under the age of 50 has disappeared, and he's now in line with Sanders.
However, Clinton clearly leads with older voters.
Last month Clinton led Sanders in the double-digit century with liberals, but now Sanders is leading this group by five percentage points.
Approximately half of the country's democracies say that they will be eager to support Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
A fourth says he supports her with certain reservations, and 15% would support her only because she is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
The opinion is more confusing for those who do not currently support Clinton - only a quarter of them would be eager to support him.
Where 48% of the Democrats say that they would be eager to support Clinton, the Republican first man, Donald Trump, says the same is true of the fewer Republican voters (35%).
When Clinton's supporters were asked why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had the right experience (16%) and then the most popular answers were that now was the right time for the female president (13%) and that he was the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the Vice-President has an influence on the possible presidential candidate, 57% of the democratic voters would like to see him in the race already - even though one third disagrees.
If you ask the Democrats who they would choose to be second in the party's name, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say they'd choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek a democratic candidate, the leadership of Hilary Clinton from Sanders will grow. If Biden goes along, the management will be 20 percentage points, but if he leaves, the number will be 30.
55% of the Democrats believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
By this standard, Biden remains far away, but the proportion of those who consider him most voting has grown.
However, when asked what was the most important thing about the candidate, they raised their opinions above the question of voteability.
Even last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered to be an impossible candidate for these voters.
The candidates or potential candidates for democratics are well qualified for certain key issues among the voters of their party.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden is best at triple honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty per cent of the Democrats say that Clinton is not considered honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent says they have no opinion of Sanders.
In general terms, Democrat voters also believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
Looking at all these issues, about a quarter of the Democrats say they have no opinion on Sanders.
Although the use of Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and server while he is a foreign minister still raises questions, the majority of the Democratists are satisfied with his explanation of the matter and say that the matter did not affect their public opinion on him.
But it's different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about one third are satisfied.
The public’s views were shared in March shortly after the day came to light.
Most Americans say that e - mail policy did not influence their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say that their opinion on him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say that their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32% consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has fallen 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say that Clinton is not considered honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of the country's registered voters do not think Trump is honest and reliable either.
But both Clinton and Trump are considered to be good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered to be the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many don't have an opinion on him, just like Carson does.
The error margin in the study involving 351 democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in a national poll.
Ben Carson is coming near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll.
In the new survey, two candidates collected half of all the votes, leaving others to fight for the foothold.
Throughout the country, the Republican voters are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has increased to 27 % of the questionnaire published by CBS before the elections of Fox News last month.
At the same time, however, Carson rose from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is well-managed among the various demographic groups and is excluding Trump from the high-level Republican voters.
The rest of the field is lagging behind, except for Carly Fiorina and the Ohio Governor John Kasich. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support has decreased most: from 10% last month to 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and floridan Senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6%.
The error margin in the sample of this latest survey, which was carried out in September, is +/- 6 %.
Last week's latest CNN/ORC survey showed Carson's rise in the polls: he has 19% support for the Republicans, and Trump is above him by 32%.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was also significantly ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity rose last week, Trump criticised retired neurosurgery for nothing, even though Carson apologized to Trump's questioning of his faith.
"We need energy", Trump said last Saturday at his campaign visit in Iowa.
Five fraternity members are charged with the death of a first-year student at Baruch College.
Almost two years after the student died at the Brotherhood Simputus ceremony in the Pocono Mountains region of Pennsylvania, the murder charge has been brought against five people.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of the Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the membership rite in September 2013, and then delayed taking him to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a pack of sand of over 13 kilos, and then he was repeatedly beaten into the ground as he tried to walk through an ice field towards the finish.
Finally, Deng complained that his head was hurt, and then he lost consciousness.
The members of the brotherhood did not call the emergency number after Deng passed out, but, according to the accusations, waited an hour before they brought him to the hospital, the police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search the network for information on his symptoms, and contact the Brotherhood National Chairman Andy Meng, asking for advice, Chris Wagner, police chief, at a press conference.
"This is where the members began to hide their ritual equipment, and in practice put the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," said Commissioner Wagner.
They couldn't get Deng to break up, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated blows to the head, body, and thigh of a blunt object.
"A lot of families have suffered from fraternity sprawl, when at least one student has died every year since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this is an important step for the authorities.
The great jury of Monroe County was in favour of the first five members being charged with the murder of the third degree.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent stimuli and criminal plotting.
"We do not want to be held responsible only for individuals. If there is an organisation behind what has happened that has officially or informally accepted the situation, they must also be held responsible", Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood demolished its connection with the local department.
This is what happens when the U.S. central bank increases interest rates
The interest rate rises, and the market for rising rates falls, bond yields rise and the economy declines.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's going to take or how long it's going to take.
The past does little to help with timing, especially in terms of the economy.
The coming of the recession has lasted only 11 months since the first lifting, and sometimes it has been as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the U.S. central bank in raising interest rates has often, albeit not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why the US Central Bank officials have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on it, because interest rates are being raised, but mainly on the development cycle of the time to normalize the situation.
Indeed, there are several variables in the equation.
However, in the end, market participants will be able to see that all interest-bearing measures have been oversized.
"The first increase since the global economic crisis in the central bank is inevitably interpreted in some circles as the end of the 'bad money' era," said Julian Jessop, the chief economic expert on global affairs at Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to normal, albeit still low, levels of shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it would not have any effect.
Below is an overview of how some areas of the economy will react in the light of past developments:
As has been seen on the market in the last month or so, waiting to raise interest rates can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital tends to stop 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what will happen after the increase of the central bank.
More specifically, in the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, with an increase of around 14% when the increase is approached, 250 days after which the situation is fairly stable (mean increase of 2.6%), and normal conditions have been reached after 500 days with average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, as reported in the recent analysis of Bob Doll, the leading capital strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, published in the Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on the shares is generally clearer at a later stage of the raising cycle when the yields start to fall.
The recessions are part of the economy, but interest payments often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not previously been faced and which can accelerate the recession.
This is in particular the gross domestic product, which will be closest to its lowest ever level before the central bank's interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, the nominal annual GDP in the 118 increases since 1950 has only been less than 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 per cent, few believe it will last after the third quarter has reached 1.5 per cent, reports Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
The rise in interest rates in such a fragile economic system can be risky and raises the question of whether this is a "is different", Deutsche Bank stated.
The market participants have been preparing for the central bank's increase for the whole year, and everyone is waiting for this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will end on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept the increase in this meeting, futures trade only anticipates a 25% probability.
"Our research shows that since 1950, all lifting cycles have so far experienced an increasing leverage effect in supercycles where GDP has passed its peaks before the recession very quickly after the recovery has begun," says the report.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst in the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been overwhelmingly looking forward to the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now the 74th month is in progress.
The flat-rate return has also been unstable in the face of the market's expectation of an interest rate increase and the model is somewhat similar to the findings made on capital.
The main difference is that, when the central bank changes its line, its effects are more visible in bonds than in shares.
The trend in bond yields appears to change immediately with the first increase/surgery of the cycle.
At the end of the raising cycle, bond yields will fall immediately," said Deutche Bank.
Charles Schwab's strategies believe that the increase in interest rates will bring about convergence in the yields of longer and shorter-term bonds, thus smoothing down the yield curve.
High-income bonds often produce better in a situation like this, although "we are still careful about looking for a return", said the analyst Kathy Jones of the fixed yield of Schwab in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of a tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more stable, the credit margins have increased and the instability has increased - all these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened up its policy.
In general, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt are doing less when the value increase of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than their funding.
"Historia shows that "quality" shares are generally more profitable in the three months after the first raise," Goldman Sachs analysts noted in their customer-oriented report.
After the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, companies with strong turnover passed weak turnover by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares were better than low-quality companies. The first average was 4 (percentage) and the latter 3 (percentage).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Those companies that have a lot of variable interest debts are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside the market speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
Savingrs can also make a profit with higher profits, although the experts disagree on how fast the impact feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, says Congressman Andrew Bingham
Congressman Andrew Bingham blames the channel for "nationalisation"
He claims that it becomes increasingly difficult to separate it from a commercial competitor.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that they only imitate the British Awards
Member of the House Damien Collins criticises The Voice saying that it is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is changing to Classic FM, claims the leading representative adding pressure from the production company to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not.
A Conservative Member, Andrew Bingham, also told the BBC leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to have a 'transparent' content and that it would be increasingly difficult to distinguish from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards Awards, which was launched last December.
"The last year's BBC Music Awards only appears to be a British Awards gala under a different name.
So if you try to do something different, here are two examples I remember directly when you actually just copied something that you already have on the market," Bingham said.
The Director-General of the BBC contested the accusations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is much ahead of his commercial competitor as regards live music and knowledge sharing.
Radio 3 teaches me things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, first-class.
"In addition, I think it is really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, Chief of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel must do more work than previously to reach the audience because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of BBC's offer, which was criticised for entering the toes of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Member of the Conservative Tory Party Damien Collins criticised The Voice, a music competition purchased by BBC from the Dutch production company Talpa Media estimated at GBP 22 million.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and is in no way original?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1-channel program, in which Paloma Faith and Boy George are star judges, was produced "in the BBC style".
He added that he wanted the production company to "find success inside his own house" the next time he started the entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of the coming seasons of The Voice, or to determine that the money of the licensee would be used for other forms of entertainment.
Online sales increased the lowest so far in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Net sales increased by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month there was an increase following the start of low statistics in 2000
Three years ago online sales were confirmed by the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday might contain consumption
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has grown enormously and has transformed many of Britain’s shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a levelling of online sales in the air, while the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
In August, total consumption grew least since the start of statistics in 2000: only five per cent from the year before.
Experts say that there are signs of online sales levelling in the air, when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If we look at the levels of growth in previous years and return to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be rational over time", Andy Mulcahy, a supplier of the JMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales were strengthened when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people shopping online and that they could be made in different environments, such as the couch.
But now it is leveling, and (growth) can be calculated.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, has been considered as one of the reasons behind slowing down shops.
Experts believe that consumers will control shopping before the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers flocked to their computers to grab shops, pouring over the websites of many traders.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which led buyers to argue about the findings, can curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail consortium found that only about one out of five pounds were used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of wearing fashion chains for shopping streets.
The Muslims are burying the dead in the Mecca Uprising Accident, the Bin Laden family.
The Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has been partly accused of a collapse in the building left by Saudi Binary Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were injured when the crane collapsed.
29 dead were carried in the air across the streets, and hundreds of Muslims gathered together to bury them. The victims died when the crane collapsed in Mecca's great mosque.
Mostly white-dressed mourners filled the path to honor the first of the dead who made their final journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession passed the holy place, where only a few days ago the crane fell through the roof of the mosque and poured down worshipers.
The bodies were released for burial when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed that Bin Laden’s family was guilty of a disaster involving 394 people.
The bodies of 29 of the worshipers who had fallen in the Mecca’s great mosque were carried across the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children from Qasim Akram Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in a major mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hay-sacrifice.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that the hay Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane handle up when it was not in use.
The decision published by the Saudi Press Agency of the State in its Arabic version stated that the Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English - language service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s directors were prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week Salman swore to survive the fall of the cranes in the yard of the great mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before this month's hay-sacrifice.
The Binladin Group has not published any reports on the collapse of the poor and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The royal decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around the Mecca factory, which are part of the huge building robbery led by the Binladin Group.
The family of Binladin has been close to the Saudi Arabian ruling family for decades, leading to major construction projects.
Al-Qaida's late leader Osama bin Laden was a rebel son whose family denied in the 1990s.
The collapse took place in the wind and rainy weather only days before millions arrive in the kingdom for pilgrimage, which every able Muslim must do at least once in his life.
The authorities say that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered one million rals ($174,000) to be paid to the families of the dead and to the permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
The B&Q boss says that East European low-cost workers are behind popularity
The British are increasingly using the services of their assistants, Veronique Laury says.
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, Screwfix deals for professionals will be opened 200 more
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores all over the country
Author Rupert Steiner, city's main correspondent Daily Mail
The British are told to give up hammers and paint brushes and to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home rehabilitation work.
It seems that if you're smart with a hammer or you start painting walls, you're a minority now.
You see, the British are hiring more and more helpers to do their own tea and tea work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new president of Kingfisher, who owns the home repair chain, said that behind the popularity is the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a mock-up price.
This leads to Kingfisher planning to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said that she wanted more women to work at B&Q stores, because eight out of ten shopping decisions are made by a more beautiful sex.
Now most of the staff are men.
He said that the changes in the population must be taken into account: today, there are more single women's economies doing more home rehabilitation than before.
Laury said, "The biggest part of our shop staff is still men.
We need to strike a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the decisions to buy products are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of only five women who run the main companies in the British FTSE100 index. He has rebuildd his management team with the same number of male and female spouses.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with 50% of women in the group, including its CEO and financial director.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - the difference here is an important matter.
It hasn't been hard to find good women in the management team."
Kingfisher reported a fall in both the six-month profits and the sales after the group took over the costs of closing down the stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The government of three aces decided to resort to coercive legislation in order to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were therefore quite quickly achieved.
The sharp head of the SAK and other employees’ organisations began to be forced to stand on Friday because of the broad expression of workers.
A lot of people think that it also makes sense.
Let's ask if it's worth the strike when things are going bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people online have already come to announce that they are not going to participate in the demonstration, but are going to work.
In the good old days of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no online protest, but openly declaring yourself a rich person would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of trade unions does not give rise to much protest, but it gives cause for thought.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was a few decades ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of Ay's business, the government's rough solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things have seemed to be rolling on their own weight for years, the alliances are now finally able to defend the rights of the worker, in a visible and proper manner.
In this way, the government may want to imprison the role of the Ay movement, when membership in the trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary.
Whatever the organisation's actions may be, it is nonsense that the expression of Friday's mind would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product is falling further and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
Hard savings for the University of Lappeenranta: Objective 8.5 million savings, reduction of staff by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenranta will start a savings course aimed at cutting costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start negotiations on the whole staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million annually.
In practice, this means reducing about 130 workers.
In addition, two million will be saved on other activities.
The 2016 budget, which foresees a deficit of 8,5 million, is the basis for the negotiations on the Single Market.
It is also affected by the cuts in appropriations made by the government.
During this financial year, the University will produce approximately 2.6 million deficits.
Costs will increase slightly next year, but funding from the same ministry will fall by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is around EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined impact of massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in company funding on our university is very significant, says Principal Anneli Pauli in the University Newsletter.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with trustees will be launched next Tuesday and will last for six weeks as prescribed by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland on the railways
The owner of Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also targets rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of Britain's largest railway companies, Souter says.
Rail transport is to be opened up to competition gradually.
The first is close traffic in the capital region in 2017-2018.
There will be long-distance traffic after the short-distance traffic.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes the plans of Onnibus.
Other international companies have reported interest in rail transport at least Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
The U.S. Central Bank has to decide on interest rates
The rest of the world follows when the central bank of the United States meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision as to whether to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
When Reuters conducted a survey of 80 economists, slightly more than half of those who believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and that the interest rates are maintained at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is a historic event, because when the central bank cut interest rates to zero, it is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get away from zero and to start normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics, Senior Fellow.
The U.S. economy has functioned relatively well and recovery has brought billions of dollars into balance sheets and low inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rose-like global outlook.
It has warned the market that they must be ready for the take-off, but the signs also show that they believe that the odds are against the rise.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20 a.m. (CET).
The shooter of Delta State University left an apology message.
After his girlfriend was shot in Mississippi on Monday morning, before he shot his colleagues later on the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was "sorrying" about the first murder and hoped that he could cancel it, the authorities told him on Tuesday.
Mississip's Gautier police told me that the school teacher at Delta State University called the emergency number about 10:00 a.m.
Monday, he told me he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send officers to his house.
He said, "He killed his wife last night," and he also said that there is a "soul dog" in the house, which "is not bothering anyone", but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller his name, but he didn't say it.
Lamb didn't explain the shooting.
When the police got there, they found the body of the 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a message from a 45-year-old Lamb that said, "I'm so sorry, I wish I could cancel it.
I loved Amy, and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed his history teacher Ethan Schmidt before he finally killed himself late on Monday when the police surrounded him.
The university's principal, William LaForge, said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, as far as he knew, but that there was clearly something in Lamb's mind.
On Tuesday, the authorities said that despite the claims made on Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss had been in relation to Schmidt, there was no "knowledge or evidence" of any kind of "trimiodrama".
Shawn O'Steen told me he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a good person.
A couple broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that she and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who's upset.
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and her daughters were "one of the best friends in the world."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked on the Internet from her home. Sun Herald said that Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police told Lamb that he called his relatives somewhere on Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail."
When the police reached Lamb’s highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there and went running into the forest where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about education in Delta State in spring 2015, says the CV found on the University's website.
Stars that lost their charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has been hard in recent years.
In 2001 he became ill with leukaemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this, indeed, demands its tax.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months for a double break.
Luke Shaw had a double break in his right leg as Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.
Although the defender remained in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless attack within 15 minutes of Shaw's 20-year-old falling into PSV territory.
He was treated for nine minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before taking him to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double break in his leg, and he's in the hospital now."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then cut in Manchester.
This is terrible, and the boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18 years old, he's in trouble, and then he plays great, and this is what's gonna happen.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but it takes at least six months for a double fracture, and he's not playing in the bloc phase.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to get a red card and a penalty shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian agent was wrong.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a punishment shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-leg thing.
Shaw tweeted as follows: "Thank you for all your messages, the words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Subject: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw's case and loses to PSV
The English defender will have an additional incentive to recover next June's European championship in France.
P.S.V. Coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of this kind of injury, they're all very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend the opponent.
Moreno's leg broke when he played in the Mexican team against Van Galin Holland in the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this hard because the purpose is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see Luke fighting.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this. I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after Chris Modelang challenged him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Each parent will soon learn one thing: If your child loves a book, it will not take long to learn it almost outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the holiday child care service asked the Prime Minister for his favorite children's book, he chose Dr. Seussin The Lorax, the environmental story published in 1971.
The selection was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "It is funny, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to find a picture or a message that we have never seen before."
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, where Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details had been added to complete a rather short original text.
"In the town of Tarville, inside the walls, where all nature is lost and even air is a commodity, the boy hopes to win his dreams over the girl's heart by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see the right tree," says and describes the love story, which Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, did not write from the right name Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds like it's taken from the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database, which starts with the following: "The town of Tarville inside the walls, where everything is artificial and even air is merchandise, the boy hopes to win his dreams over Audrey's heart."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be such an inexplicable book conspirator. In it, a young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by the greedy, wood - beating and needy Kerskanen, regardless of the short, whistling creature that named the story, Lorax, which "speaks for the trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR task is likely to be entrusted to an assistant who apparently never read a book 20 times in a row for a child.
The Prime Minister's informant said the text must have come from Cameron's constituencies office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment at that time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of getting off the British team, but it was still a tough spot.
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I do not think that the rerun of the last 3-0 series is likely to occur.
I wouldn't even close the guest win off the bills.
Alastair Cook’s half may be less experienced than a team of three years ago, but it includes good twisters and the team’s way of thinking is strong: they have no scars from 2012, only youthful positiveness.
The fashion of Ali develops in its rotational feeding, and Adil Rashid is an assailant option, although it is an unknown factor at this level.
Subject: Adam Lyth dropped out of the UK Cricket Team, replaces Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth on the team must understandably be difficult to analyse for me because I'm his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against the attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but harsh truth is that the critics are criticised on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the announcement, because, as I have said before, players are the best selection factors.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
I hope if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance comes up.
The main coach in England, Trevor Bayliss, praised Lyth's attitude even when he did not do as well as he could, and it does not surprise me. Lyth is first and foremost a team player.
It's hard to answer the question how long it takes a batter to leave a trail.
Lyth was elected seven times to the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton got the chance to play both at home and at guests.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in peak condition, but that missed opportunity is now the past.
Alex Hales is coming with me, and there's a batter I appreciate.
There's something about him as a cricket player that we saw early this season in Yorkshire when he scored 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this certainly depends on the team’s composition in the United Arab Emirates.
There's been a spherical idea of fashion in the punching exercise next to Cook, which would bring an extra feeder to the field, but could keep four quick, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why the batter couldn't hit there, and this left-handed guy has already shown himself to be quite a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done her job in Worcestershire, but she is a third to them and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games at the first slowdown before he entered the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari will be a member of the team as a backup feeder, and, as little as I've been dealing with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can watch his unpretentious statistics hitting average 31, with a ball of 35, and think it's gambling, but there's not too many pitchers on offer, and the voters chose the young ones.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach's side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batter Mköri Jayawardene as a consultant in games can prove to be a genius stamp.
He is one of the nicest friends in the game and brings a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes into the white ball games and brings both energy and an unsatisfying rush.
I've always thought that he was born to be part of the international crisis, whether it's playing or training, and he's got the kind of smarts he's using.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested in one day, Root has been given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Even though not everyone agrees, the trainers and selectrs do not make the timetables.
And it must be remembered that just as players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on a light basis.
UK exits from the EU (Brex) can make a profit if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's semi-continental renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are becoming increasingly problematic from day to day, even if it is not taken into account even the hearty Jeremy "Yes or no?" Corbyn's choice to lead the Labour Party or the union of trade unions to be angry with Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Faragsa.
The European diplomatic blood recently explained that, because the EU is so deep in a variety of crises, not all of which are its own, some Member States are tired of Britain's self-centred agenda, full of dissenting concessions and disturbing contractual changes that these countries do not want in the most part.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Confederation of Trade Unions decided that it would not want them either if they undermine social protection.
We could call it a selfie agent for Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local eye, and then coming home to say that they are winning supporters of the reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outwards inside the British EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France', says from Berlin - proposes that the shortest-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care about us then we leave.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his work in the same way that happened to the long-term Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017 at François Holland.
He's a disappearing force, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, a left-wing in Spain.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice on behalf of the selfiebrits when their energy should rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it because of similar separatist trends.
So, my friend, some of these ministers may even deliberately plan to make useless remarks like the Scottish National Party during the 2017 British referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiation was a matter organised" and "the renegotiation was of no importance to Britain."
Europeans have been hard to experience how greedy Fleet Street newspapers can be and how EU-sceptical the press alone are, which they were not inspired by Tony Benn at the time of the 1975 referendum, when our membership started in 1973 was confirmed in the ratio 2:1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist who named himself by writing 'EU direct bananas' as an exchange of letters in Brussels in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a record of a number of strangers visiting taxes, foreigners hacking phones, and persons who are registered elsewhere and own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same about them, but he realized that if you're in a cage with a horny gorilla, you have to give up bananas because of the confusion if you don't want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later on at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blairish than Blair herself, as regards the opposition to Cameron's renegotiation, because Bair had accepted the principle behind the EU's abandoned constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thereby giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him.
But a nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly clapped me on the back of the Westminster Parliamentary House on Monday (I told him he no longer has time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-admissioning Neil Kinnock's 80s boycotted Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he still has to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not with me, but no doubt with Andrew Marri, whose BBC sofa Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says that he would like us to remain in a new Europe.
Well, most of the people outside the British Independence Party of the Ukipi War Painting and Conservative Party's wildest nationalists can certainly get behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fan" Benn said this on both the radio and TV this week, when his internal scout would have liked to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint the rough John McDonnell shadow government's Minister of Finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father was on TV trying to be unfaithful to his Labour Government colleagues without going so far as to lose his seat of government.
Hilary's struggles were more attractive.
But the fight for staying in the "whereever" - Benn's statement - was not what McDonnell said, and not from everything that Corby told the heads and the representatives of the people at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the unhierarchical, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the era of 24-hour television, and especially in social media vortexes, which are an acceptable medium of growth for paranoia and fraud.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to consider the Labour Party's support for the referendum campaign to be self-evident.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental tour of EU membership (and in line with their Benn-spirited regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate with left-wing thinkers for whom the narcism of small differences is a central dogma in opiate bludgeoning.
As for his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why would it be worth wasting political capital in Paris or Berlin (they also have suspicious voters) to grant to Britain when it can be completely useless?
The United States has already been somewhat disappointed by the weak British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the beginning of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise the Public Health England Electricity Tobacco Assessment
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency’s claim that electric cigarettes are 95% less harmful than conventional was the beginning of a meeting of 12 people, some of whom were linked to the tobacco industry.
The experts writing to the British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed to Lancet with the evidence used by the critics Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electric tobacco.
PHE published this "stamp" report last month, describing it as "a comprehensive review of evidence".
However, many researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical journal Lancet published last month a letter attacking PHE's main management decision against the "exceptional Hutera bottom".
Two other researchers at the BMJ have wondered whether the claims are "constructed on a rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policies should be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects that PHE's claim "at present, according to the best estimate, electric cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes" is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a single 12-person meeting that developed a multi-criteria decision-making model (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the disadvantages associated with different nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarised in research.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was EuroSwiss Health, which was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT’s public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced that they had received funding from the manufacturer of electric tobacco, but not the funding they were told to have received from Philip Morris International in the past.
The selection criteria for panel members are not reported, but the panel includes a number of well-known supporters of electric tobacco, some of which also report having received funding in the field of research.
Others present are not known for their expertise in the control of tobacco.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s tobacco manager.
The study produced by the group "a lot to admit" that there is a lack of "controversial evidence concerning the disadvantages of most of the products and most of the criteria", according to McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell claim that PHE's claims that "there's no evidence that electric tobacco works as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, says that the claims made at BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "Smoking cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who smoke for life die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electric tobacco are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80 000 people die from smoking-related illness every year and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even though electric cigarettes are not harmless, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
The BBC should give up EastSenders, says former Channel 4 Director.
Former Channel 4 President Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastSenders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give" anything from hits such as this series of soap on Albert Square.
Johnson said that licence fees should only be used to make programmes that are not carried out by other British broadcasters.
He criticised BBC for putting in public service programmes which are likely to have a smaller audience for difficult transmission times against the most viewed programmes of competitors and channels such as BBC4.
After Tony Hall, Director General of the BBC, said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said that he had tried to establish a relationship with BBC for six years at the time of Channel 4.
"I do not understand the idea that BBC produces and sends programmes that are clearly suitable for unsubstantiated competitors," Johnson said to the Upper Room Communications Committee as part of its study of the future of BBC.
If the licence fee is to be kept - and I am not sure it would be a good idea for this media, or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not do and do.
The Voice will be sent to the most important transmission time because as much support as possible is sought for its future.
The idea of no one else showing the program is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could also be financed without state aid.
The Voice is one such and the EastSenders another, without a ban within the house completed.
To be honest, other channels would do anything for it.
I don't understand how it's about a public service broadcast.
I don't think that would weaken BBC at all."
Channel 4 in 2004-2010 was run by serial entrepreneur Johnson who said that BBC was guilty of hunting the numbers of viewers because of the objectives of the people working there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that BBC sell such series as EastSenders.
Johnson said that the public service programmes of BBC's smaller audience "are going to BBC4, which often cannot measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thus fulfils its responsibilities and can then, in defending the 4 billion-pound fee revenues, say hypocritically that 'of course, we are doing all these unknown programs that no one is looking at'.
They put them on a missionary site where no one will ever see them.
With regard to the licence fee, Mr Johnson said to the Committee: 'I challenge you to seek a more regressive system of who gets the most value for it.
Of course you are all thinking, we all think that at £150 a year there will be a lot of value, but I do not know if that is true for those people for whom £150 is a lot of money, because they do not spend much on BBC.
The former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also testified to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its earlier role as "information, training and entertainment".
He said that only a small part of BBC's production is now classified as education - he said that the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take a model from the Australian and Canadian broadcasts and change the role to "information, education and entertainment".
With regard to the partnership issues, Elstein said that BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which, according to him, are shown on television only a few times, and become allies with commercial companies so that they can all be watched online.
"Voice genetics" allows brain cell control through sound waves
The video shows how the shuttle beams change direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Researchers have grown worms with genetically engineered nervous systems to be controlled by sound waves.
The small beams change direction as soon as they hit a sound pulse that is too high for human ears to be heard.
The pulses work by switching on genetically engineered motion nerve cells with ultrasound-responsive membranes.
Subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said that worms indicate the functioning of a new method called sound genetics, which can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
A researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, indicated to The Guardian that one day the method could replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure leading to electrical impulses in the human brain to treat Parkinson’s disease.
The shuttleworms did not react normally to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles reinforced ultrasound waves, which then entered the worms.
The confirmed ultrasound waves affect TRP-4 ion channels, structures present in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves make these ion channels open up and activate the cells attached to them, says a report published in Nature Communications.
In order to produce ultrasonic-controlled shuttleworms, Chalasani genetically engineered worms so that part of their movement nerve cells are TRP-4-ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on modified worms, the microbubbles reinforced the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms in which they turn on the modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same characteristics as the optogenetics, a pioneering tool that enables scientists to turn nerve cells on and off by using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike the light that has to be sent along the optical fiber to the desired point inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue without any obstacle, so they can be sent to the brain from the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic virus can allow target human nerve cells to react instantaneously to an ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in the clinical environment," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Advertise the British Arms Trade
Watch the video against Amnesty International's anti-arms fair.
Horrible killing machines!
Leg irons that crush ankles!
Drink bombs!
And electrical stuns that cause painful pain but leave no traces!
The happy voice and comic book language leave no doubt that this advertising of the world's largest state fair is a sharp baroque produced by Amnesty International in order to highlight the British government's willingness to trade weapons to the repressive governments at the ExCeL Centre, ExCeL, International, at the ExCeL Centre, in London's shipyard area.

As a result of a separate campaign, many posters appeared for bus stops and metro trains, which require more detailed access.
"Immediate information, will you travel on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" is asked together using the London underground font and brand, as the DLR track turns into a tank image.
This September, a bunch of gun dealers arrive on the DLR route... and customers are asked to help stop the weapons fair.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose work was presented at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped spread posters all over London using the "Ad Space Hack Packs" package. It is a six-pound pack of hexagon keys, which says that the collective can access a third of the advertising space of bus stops throughout the planet.
Transport for London is not pleased with this unauthorized "public vandalism".
One of the parodia ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to the Cruel Designs curator and the University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists increasingly question and want to take political work to outside audiences.
Many artists have started working with activists in opposition fronts when they realize that they must go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another anti-arms poster greets business travelers on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been watched on Facebook over 100 000 times in the last 24 hours. It was created free by VCCP, as well as by a graphic designer and background reporter who worked for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever found that no weapons fairs were advertised at all, and the ExCeL calendar also had an empty point, and he said, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They used to play with the idea of a more realistic advertisement for a shady-origin corporation, but "it was more stopable to stress it with bright colors and animation".
"They have done a fantastic job in helping us to raise questions about the illegal torture device sold at the fair," says Amnestyn Tom Davies.
Now, the British Government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally sold near our home.
Perhaps the most creative art in connection with the space fair comes from within ExCeL when exhibitors trade fantastically decorated products.
In his press release, he's getting an order from the U.S. Army from "the AT4CS RS triggering from the shoulder".
This includes "a unique piping warhead that focuses on the excellent effects behind the armor inside the object".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student apartment
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student apartment when I was 19 when I was ignorant, and that's when I believed in barettes and moral relativism, but only now I remember the violent smiles of the people I've provoked and the numerous, long complaints of others.
Much of what I have learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory can be anything that goes to the nerves from being completely scary.
It's tempting to be flattered: tell me where you come from, did you like a year and where you think about Corbyn, and why "I really don't love or hate Marmite because really it's just a yeast hahaha find me in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others to take a breath... ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and not those you would not like to talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they would share the extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movies, and general entertainment places, but they are also places where people dress and repair their underwear.

Your room should be a resting place, but many dormitories form a culture of travelling from room to room, which is friendly, social and gives rise to lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say, "I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now that I can recover the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing and perhaps send a text message instead of knocking on the door.
Knocking when the speech came: knock.
A guy in my student apartment thought that if the door wasn't locked, he'd been invited in.
He saw quite a few things.
Make friends through bakery.
Since you're starting the university at the top of the bakery trend, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate pastry plate and showing yourself seems a little less strange, less "welcome to the neighborhood, bake something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" -50th century.
The offering of self-made treats is an excellent way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk, and it may be that in the future they will combine your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you know how to bake.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar-fats are likely to make people pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Obviously, stealing someone's chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk for your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It's possible they'll give you permission, even if they're boiling internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to be more adult about it than my roommate who mixed detergent in his milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You don't have to make noises so people don't get to sleep or learn.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial pot gloating the boiler.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play drum and bass music a little lower, because it was 3:00 in the morning and he had a exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted down at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep two hours before making her own music sound, locked her doors and left for a three - hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm with you?
Or vice versa, wouldn't it be incredibly embarrassing if you kept your roommate as your future mate, you would get into one, get divorced, and then you would see him every day and possibly lose all your friends to him.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if a hot roommate isn't your future mate, you could at least try to talk sense down there.
At the exhilarating moment when you realize that someone has left his key in his unlocked room, the line between flapping and bullying is thinr than it seems.
A good trick is fun, but it'll be cancelled in a moment.
You can give a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something, but never mess someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you'll put in the freezer, but don't put their property on the ceiling with a blue sticker like twice.
Racist attack on the residence of foreign students in Kite - The house planned as a reception center was snuffed out in Salo
A racist attack was carried out on Kite in North Karelia on Saturday morning at the home of foreign students.
Contrary to what the police have told us earlier, it is not accommodation facilities for minors seeking asylum, but bed spaces for foreign students already in Finland, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher of the People's College of Kite Evangeline.
The windows and walls of the accommodation facilities of the National University were swept with racist signs, such as the hakarists, and a metal object had been thrown through one of the accommodation windows," says the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, the responsible teacher of social security training of young people at the National University, the building under the influence of vandalism was estimated to have ten people at the time of the attack.
"There was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some could be elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
People from 12 different nationalities are housed at the National University.
They have already been students in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minors.
All the people in the messed-up building have a status.
Some are studying in adult basic school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying in Finland," Luukkainen says.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Eastern Finland police are investigating the attack as an act of harm and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukinen, an information conference was held for students on Monday, with the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic in here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for the past ten years, and this is the first time that something like this happens," Luukkainen says.
According to the lockman, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men were suspected to be the performers and had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think this is the head of the Youth weekend, when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," Luukkainen says.
Salo also has a hospital planned for the reception centre.
The case happened last week.
This was reported on the MTV website on Tuesday night.
There was a hakarist drawn on the wall of the hospital and written in English "You are not welcome".
There's been a report of a crime to the police.
Revision 15.9 at 16.02 Revised incorrect information provided by the police on the age and status of the people living in the building.
The state will put an end to the Y-train for the Karelian... passengers in their misery, "excellently idiotic"
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepor Karja will cease to run in March.
The news upset the passengers on the beginning of the night of the train in Helsinki’s main railway station.
In particular, the drive down strikes the Suntiians, said Torbjörn Bengtström, a municipality.
Very idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and people in work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This cannot be dependent on anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says on the HSTV interview video that he'll come with a tractor to the capital.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains running on the main track shall be connected to the new R-line.
Purola's station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusula are out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes to which the Ministry will purchase train traffic during the following contract period.
The contract period will change at the end of the year and there will be routes to be terminated throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in autumn will be later approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
The Siuntio Bengtström considers that the State’s train surgeon is a short-sighted activity.
We make the same mistakes we have made before and we repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there will be repentance.
The Y train is also used by people other than the Raaseporians and the Siuntians, because it is fast and crosses several stations.
Annina Pöyryä, in Espoo, was upset by the fate of those travelling further from the city area.
"It's very bad for those who have to plan their journey again," he said when he was in pain on the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
There is probably a new train connection to the beach track, which will replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region (HSL) area, which will take you to Kirkkonum.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to find out different options and their impact on the level of service and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y train in about a million years, of course, much more than that.
The R line on the main track will skip two stations.
On the other hand, in Ainola and Sauna Kalli, the number of trains will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuru and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinajoki.
The Pieksämäki Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkus route.
Trains will be reduced on the Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu routes.
More than half a million trips per year are made on a daily basis, while the total number of journeys purchased by the Ministry is around nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring annual savings of 12.3 million to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the Relativity of Capital: "Marx is worth getting to know"
The crisis in the world economy has brought to the surface the capital of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work, published in 1867-1894, to write in the book The timing of Marx's capital, known as the former President of GDP, Yrjö Hakanen, today.
"He will be taken more seriously now than he has been for a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and increasing penetration into all sectors of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved to be amazingly far-reaching.
The list of books based on the Kääsen-seminars organised by Hakasen also contains Professor of Aalto University, the respected financial participant Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx's current "year and forever".
However, the former CEO of the Department of Business Research and Industry is not Marxian, is it?
No, not at all.
Korkman says on the phone that Marx is not considered to be a current economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are isolated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary expert.
"The usual concept is that the history of the brain tells of the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It's true that Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
We are talking again about Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of the technical upheaval," Korkman analyses.
But what the government should decide tomorrow will not help Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
Still, Mr. Marx thinks Korkman should get to know him.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't read," says Korkman.
"The Maoists and Trotskys and other sects hated capitalism, but more of each other".
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political burden of years ago.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's thinking world, like other classics," says Korkman.
The UN demands war criminals in Sri Lanka
The UN demands the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the civil war in Sri Lanka, reports AFP.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 was published on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report blames both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as Tamils for war crimes.
The civil war in Sri Lanka is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
There are no precise data on the number of victims.
In particular, the large-scale attack by the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, and the UN report demands.
The Sri Lankan armed forces report blames torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which were victims of as likely a man as women.
According to the report, rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children to fight.
According to the report, both parties have committed murder.
On Wednesday, Sri Lanka replied that it intended to organise the investigation itself, but did not intend to allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice because foreign judges.
In the yo-test of England, we were able to redistribute social media
On Wednesday a long foreign language was replaced by the majority of students in the autumn.
More than 16,000 pilots tested their English skills.
It was possible to write the material in the experiment, even in social media.
Based on our own experiences, we needed to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of 150 - 250 words in English could be addressed to the operator of the online advisory column.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelia resting chair.
She had to ask for advice on how parents could also look at things for young people.
There were four subjects in total, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them", assesses the third topic of Porvoo's Swedish-speaking high school English lecturer Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was only a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic was, according to Lybeck, quite nice.
It was supposed to write a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school we've been practicing writing speeches," says Lybeck, and evaluates the whole experiment as "almost normal".
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English test was used to answer questions about texts, such as adaptation of the summer birch to climate change and handling of large data masses.
Some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when there will be a second domestic or Swedish or Finnish test.
In high school, the test is organised normally, so the expression of the employees does not affect it.
The Student Qualifications Board invites testers to find suitable connections in time to get to the trial.
Additional time can be given if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
In Oulu, a trade was robbed with a gun.
In Oulu on Wednesday morning, the store was robbed in the city of Kello.
According to the police, the mugger was dressed in dark clothes and in a masking commando.
He's normal and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
They're investigating this as a heist.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protestors in Helsinki - support units from other parts of Finland
The protest against the government's operating decisions will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, predicting the police.
According to preliminary information, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akaka and STK alliances will meet at the railway station at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The police at work, on the other hand, have the task not only of carrying out the alarm and other police activities but also of ensuring that the giant expression is smooth.
Roads leading to the railway station will be closed off from motor vehicles for approximately 9.30 to 14.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed into the area.
From the Hakaniemi direction traffic is cut off from the Kaisaniemi traffic circle, from the west direction to the Mannerheiminti.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
For now, at least it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand on the police business case.
According to Kujala, support units from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki due to the demonstration.
The police won't tell us the exact scout.
"A little bit is coming, but as a rule, we'll be fine on our own," Kujala says.
The police are calling for the avoidance of private cars in downtown Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic hub extends from Hakaniemi level to its core.
Standby traffic is expected from morning until early evening.
With protestors from other parts of Finland, there are also many order buses coming to Helsinki.
They won't be released to the Railway Sentire.
The buses are basically a little far away.
The end of the trip will then have to walk to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The expression also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the police point of view, there's a positive side.
The question of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at these large gatherings, is now partly self-sufficient.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policy may be coming to Helsinki.
The police expect the expression to be smooth.
People are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are reasonable and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations will also be held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's expression of mind is unusual in many ways - do you remember these strikes and expressions of mind?
The big expression organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and extraordinary in many ways.
For example, there is no very good reference point in Finnish political history, says Professor of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä emeritus Martti Siisiinen.
It's no wonder the Ay movement protested.
If it didn't, it'd raise your hands in front of the government," says Sisäinen.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the Finnish corporate tradition - and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough grips are missing contract law.
There are a lot of features here that really try to get the ay movement on its knees.
At the same time, the ay store has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the Ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
The new is now the sharp division whose expression leads to the presence of one whose ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed from all over Finland expressed their views at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you're looking for a reference point for a Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostoristai, which was organized in 1993, says Siisiinen.
In the middle of the deepest depression, Murrostorstai collected 20 000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon's (central) government tripped from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish government and the employees’ organisations had never been as bad as they were during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the government's relationship with the Ay movement may be even worse than in the times of the Murrostorst.
Besides, the Finnish bourgeois government is now in power, says Siisainen.
The current government coalition is still so interesting that it is so tightly right-wing, despite the speeches made by the basic Finns.
There were certain elements of the old labour movement at a time of sharpness.
Several thousand protestors are expected to be present on Friday.
The expression also stops public transport and possibly closes day care centres and schools.
Although the expression does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the biggest for many years.
In recent years, approximately 300 demonstrations have been organised annually in Helsinki.
They're from the side to the side.
Traditionally, the protests of the Finnish Ay movement have been quite peaceful, even though the practices have been tightened up in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law-abiding.
Proclaimers try to avoid harming or destroying property, says Siisinen.
But at the end of the 1990s, there were new winds.
The culture of demonstration changed.
EU membership upset farmers to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on them.
The firemen strike lasted three months in 1998.
Among other things, pilots and air traffic controllers also had outstanding strikes.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strike of the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power and power strike in 1977.
Seventy thousand metal men participated in the metal man strike.
The strike was suspended with the proposal of the Conciliation Committee after seven weeks of the strike.
Metal men received a 16% raise.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused electric shocks all over the country.
In March 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people, many of whom were made unemployed by the recession, met at the Parliamentary House to express their support for the work.
Firemen strike for three months in 1998
Firemen's strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were forced to lay eggs while farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
One of the slogans was "Sopera teaches, the EU ends".
For Espa, the farmers sprung tons of snow.
The EU Summit in Helsinki in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn hays in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses strike for about a month in 1995.
Last time, they had been in strike in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marked by a few deaths during the strike.
The strike and the mass redundancies of the nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass withdrawal finally speeded up the negotiations.
Doctors strike in 2001
"Doctors in strike - forcing" was the slogan of strike doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted five months and led to a lively debate on how the attacks could jeopardise patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the Move in 2013
Some 5 000 students marched for student support in Helsinki from Senate to Parliamentary House in 2013.
The Central Criminal Police will find out the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for assistance in the investigation of the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees near the German border in Aisterheim.
It is not known whether the truck was potentially on its way to Finland.
Everyone in the truck was in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility are at the scene of the event in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling on a truck in Austria became more fatal.
It seems that all 71 passengers on board at that time died by suffocation.
According to the broadcaster who first told us about the cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish public limited company.
The company carries out restaurant activities, for example, and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
Two Iraqiisms have been arrested for smuggling human beings in Austria.
The captain who beats the refugees, the former drug dealer and the subversive businessman... the story of five smugglers.
The sublime king of smugglers, the violent boat driver, the stylish missionary, and the self-sustaining cab driver.
For example, such people carry out trafficking in human beings into the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci at the University of Trento have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and the book Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the hips of trafficking in human beings, put forward proposals for solutions, and present smugglers from different levels of business.
HS will introduce five of them.
I'm gonna beat the hell out of them right now.
The Lighting Islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for a summer visit.
On behalf of their location, the islands are also excellent for smuggling, as the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 km away.
Due to comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the captain who burns in the chain, and the father of six children.
The islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fishermen are more profitable in transporting people.
That is what Emir has done on his blue, ten - foot - long wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat's full, it's got 40 people.
For one trip, Emir will make some €8,000 after the expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for customers all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until again, with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the island of Kerennna in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he can see.
Food is given in such a way that the customers are just about to survive.
The accommodation costs about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We'll go to the water at midnight with a light extinguished.
The first night is driven away from the islands, then stopped, waited for the day, and then drove to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and passengers cry and vomit in waves of 20 metres [20 m].
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats up his clients, and at least he claims to beat the sounders to death.
In the book, he tells us that when the police were nursing him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I took the customers one by one from the neck and threw them overboard," says Emir in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of Sahara.
I'm told he's gonna have to assault his countrymen for this.
I'm gonna beat the hell out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge here immediately.
He's a regular cab driver.
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaša, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good. The starter engine's pulling out the last of it, and anyway, he's seen his best days.
The most important thing, however, for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving at all and is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaša is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
There is a centre for asylum seekers next to the village, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests surrounding the centre, men travelling without their families are housed in tents, bearings, and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who have not submitted an application for asylum to Serbia for a reason or for another reason.
Some also reside in private homes, but it is a public secret.
Among the hunters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of border crossings and weekly walks on a difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When you finally arrive in the Bogovaša area, the great hub for human smuggling, people are tired of death.
Goran’s rideers are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqis and Kurdishs.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their things once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to compromise.
That's what Goran doesn't like.
Stupid fool all the way.
First, for example, 300 euros will be agreed, then they will put it down to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran points out that he's a nice and good-hearted man.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says that he is working cheaper than the others and that he is going to charge only EUR 50 per person from the border with Hungary.
There are three hundred kilometers, most comfortably on the freeway.
They say they're asking for a triple or a quadruple price.
Goran earns about EUR 50 000 a year.
It is not a large amount for the smuggler, but in Serbia it is quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not carry migrants 12 km closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran does not care: he knows the ways and the shortcuts and takes his rides a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and swings away.
At the Work of Grace
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called Missionary, and that's not just a nickname.
Indeed, he has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda, where many believers who fled the Congo, and a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees that he's doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber ribbon of white under his underpants is elegantly squeezing under his low waist.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV, and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The client calls from one of the five telephone numbers of the missionary.
He advises us to arrive at the border in the morning, to hide the money vistaly, and to drift into the midst of traders crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seekers or refugees, the Ugandan authorities must be informed that they come from, for example, the war zones in North Kivu and that they have had to flee their home for violence.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the missionary arranges a new identity for the client.
The old I.D. will be destroyed and replaced.
That's what helps the Missionary's contacts with the Ugandan police.
The customer is then referred to the same place as the real asylum seekers go: asylum procedures, NGOs, and finally the UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR).
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He invoices each portal separately: lodging an application to Ugandan police costs about EUR 100, managing documents to the humanitarian organisation about EUR 150 and the migration process, for example, to a European country of EUR 4 500-7 000.
Foliota and ice cubes
Tom is a beginner smuggler, a former drug dealer.
Four-and-a-half Irishmen patrol the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He has an Afghan, French taxi driver, and dozens of truck drivers living in London who may not even know they're in the private transportation business.
At night, Tom and the cab driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the center of Calais.
They're driving the A26 motorway and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for organising illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been sitting here for seven years because of drugs.
The taxi will stop, Tom and his customers will run across the freeway to the resting place where the drivers will sleep before they continue across the channel to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck to make sure it's on its way right to England, not to the Netherlands, for instance, cut the cover's safety wire.
You have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's involved, but that's when it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in an aluminium foil, similar to the one wrapped around a roast or an oven potatoes in the kitchen.
It should prevent a police thermal scanner from detecting a hideout.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place, hoping that there will be no sudden lightning passengers driving before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous smugglers.
The Upporian Turkish has been called the champion of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, who controls the sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money at hand.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship-wreck: Turkish ports are said to be renting pleasure sails to take Americans or European families to comfortable tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, ships will be loaded full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who will first be transported from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe at sea.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls until it is time to leave.
People get stuck in minivans and drive somewhere along the coast.
They're told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, you must board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden under deck for the entire journey.
The maritime guard can only observe how deep the ship is swimming, as no other sign of the crowd is visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers excavate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive about 53 000 euros for one luxury ship trip.
He does not handle practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other smaller factors to do the work for himself.
During the summer, at least hundreds of transports are organised and Küçuk makes millions of dollars.
He is believed to have bought a country through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company, and more than a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçuk was arrested in 2011 with a representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
After that, apparently, he's gone.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: Death's Travel Agency book will be published here, not next week.
In his book, the American Olympics reported his illness and becoming a prostitute
The new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 150,000 - foot [1,500 m] racer, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published breaks from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in excellent condition and ran for the second best time in the race.
At the finals, however, he panicked.
At the beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his leading position with a manic run.
However, 150 metres before the finish line, his powers ran out.
He collapsed onto the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the finish line, and Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later, it became apparent that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself experienced tremendous pressures of success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of having money for sex with foreign men.
He also overreacted his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's tax was EUR 450 an hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury life.
One explanation of Favor Hamilton’s becoming a prostitute was also that he needed the same adrenaline spikes as he had been competing in sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner was revealed at the end of 2012, when the Smoke Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 metres in the world’s statistical unit at 3.57.40, but remained the last of Sydney’s Olympic finals.
The world champion was thrilled when the alliance put the Norwegian skier under control: "From the back of the head"
The Norwegian skiing king, Petter Northug, has exceeded the limits of suitability for at least one of his colleagues.
Like last year and last autumn, Northug and the Norwegian Ski Union have reversed the sports agreement.
Although the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for the multiple world champion and the Olympic winner.
The Norwegian Ski Union decided to exclude Northug from the world cup of the coming season.
The decision was awarded to the double world champion, Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the alliance put the ski resort under control.
"Thank you for pointing the spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union's sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Union and Northug is about money.
I think Northug would like to be part of the country team so he can promote his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that also cares for future generations and does not give one athlete in the salts.
At the same time, he recalled that the Union has given Northug financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a completely different set of rules than just because he has the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release, which assured him that he wanted to play sports in Norwegian colours next season in the world cup and then in the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six MM medals in his career, two of which are gold.
He was in Falun last winter in a team that won the gold of the message.
They also celebrate the shield day of the pastors in the Nordic countries.
On the 25th of September, there will be moves in various restaurants and shops, which have been granted a shield by the Cook translators.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of food know-how and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and to raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of a high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but the top restaurants audited and classified by an impartial operator are located around Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the visibility of the turtle restaurants and the organization.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in the restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the Old Town Restaurant participates in the turtle day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has therefore been decided to make the event one of the most important international events of the organization, which will take place in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhahook magazine: Appealed to the Chancellor of Justice for the establishment of the Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre on the premises of Kauhava ex-equipment currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the area still has a permanent critical infrastructure in crisis times, which is used by the Defence Forces and its collaborator, Finland's Special Networks Ltd.
According to the Kauhahook magazine, the investment of the reception centre in the same building as the private person would constitute a significant safety risk which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Aviation School, the effect of which has also not been clarified in the preparation of the reception centre, the magazine.
The case states that negotiations have been held over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the outcome of any foreign operator to the airport.
The matter has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistön (ps.) and the Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
The private party notes to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about the principle of opposition to the reception centre, but about the fact that the planned location in the former military area is wrong.
The City Government of Kauava dealt with the reception center case last Monday.
Niistö: the situation in Syria reflects Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The administration means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, and Niinisto commented to journalists in the evening after meeting the presidents of all the parliamentary parties with their official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, concerns about the management of the refugee situation brought together all participants.
He appreciates the fact that the Finnish Government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges
According to the Moisture, the situation in Syria, as well as the actions of Russia and the United States in the region, can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
The Niistö is hopeful about the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, that is, the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the current tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to the Moisture, the NATO issue was also addressed in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the situation in the labour market.

Media Researcher: Sipilä takes a high risk
According to Sipil, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are one of the other channels.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told journalists in the Parliament.
The Sipila did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches become a repeated practice.
According to Sipil, speeches may not always be conveyed on the Yle Canals in the future.
If other channels report as channels, we'll see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires television and radio speech to be given to citizens.
This dossier, which is being discussed, is quite complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 both on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Arena.
♪ Takes a big risk ♪
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s TV talk will not tell us about a more general inversion of the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more strictly into your own hands and to refuse to discuss questions in the public debate?
I recall Mr Soin's recent comment that he does not follow the agenda of the media and does not allow it to define itself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters are not linked.
Bõivunen understands that the commercial media is angry with Sipilä's announcement.
It'd be weird if the media didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not announcements in democracy.
The role of the representatives of the media is specifically to ensure that no political agendas are adopted.
According to the birch, television is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, the pig should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations.
Is there more that we've already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in different ways or in different words, or say something new?
Böivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, then it must be wondered why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an extraordinary time.
In that sense, if this is not a special situation, it is a routine speech among others, it is a great risk.
The danger is that Yle will be labeled as a communication between politicians or parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or general policy.
♪ A smart bet ♪
In the future speech by Sipilä, what the Prime Minister does not say is also important, the media researcher stresses.
In the evening, we should look closely at what Sipilä is missing and where not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
Six states that TV speech is a clever bet from Sipila, because it allows him to bring his own view out without a gravel voice.
This will lead to a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The wing passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media will misinterpret something from the speech because more precise questions cannot be asked.
According to the Six, it's very important how Sipilä is on TV, whether or not it's sweating, if your hands are shaking.
He compares Sipila to the father figure, who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can make a good presentation, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to communicate something, because in this man, as if he were speaking directly to another person.
This type of activity is regularly practiced by Obama (President Barack of the United States) and partners.
Very exceptional.
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to be truly exceptional to the citizens.
According to him, it has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister would like the Finns to be in agreement with the blackmails ahead.
Wage organisations will organise demonstrations and strikes against government actions on Friday.
Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give a speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, allowing the speech to be discussed.
SDP President Antti Rinne (sd.) again states that he is challenging Sipilä's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
Soon to be six months from the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on a run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time he was found.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Inland Finland Police Department also confirms the case for the evening magazine.
He went out to play at 4:00 this afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
My dad says thank you to all the people who helped me find him.
Thank you for those dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed nearly 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star is disappointed in the violent wildness of young people:
Makwan Amirkhani published a video on Facebook, which especially appeals to young people from immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani spoke out against the street fighting of young people.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arriving in Finland at the age of five, has so far won both his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani tells me he received a message asking me to look at an Instagram account.
Videos have been downloaded in which young people fight with extremely violent grips.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed in young people's wildness.
26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking people on the ground, sitting on one side and blindly hitting them without thinking about any of these consequences when you make videos like this, and Amirkhani is updating.
It's hard to defend.
Some of the young people on the videos have an immigrant background.
According to Inspector Jarmo Heinonen, both immigrants and young people from Finland have downloaded fighting videos to social media.
It's the fact that you're fighting all over the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani, a Turkuan, reminds us.
Amirkhani recalls that there are sites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have come to an enormous extent.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you now.
You should remember that you're still in a foreign country and you're going to be a pretty long guest here.
That's a slightly different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirchani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get hit by some kind of racism, you're gonna have to blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You guys are making me hate that I don't like.
You've got some pretty bad things going on here, and you're not gonna make them any better, Amirkhani.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Lauri Lyly, Chairman of the SAK, says on Twitter that the employee organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on the St.T.K.'s proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the HRC organisation told the government that it would present its own proposal to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.
Mr Fjäder, President-in-Office of the Akkaan, believes that the Government will accept the proposal if SAK, STK and Akaka are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest employee organisation SAK soften its previous position.
In turn, Lauri Lyly, Chairman of the SAK, made a very brief comment on the matter on Twitter.
Mrs Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open up the labour market lock" and that, instead of coercive laws, agreements concluded by active parties are needed.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to SAK.
In the past, Sipilä cut off the negotiations on a social agreement when SAK refused to commit to the 5% productivity gap.
Comment: The big demonstration threatens to break through - "It feels a little funny to put on a fist"
It feels a little funny to put on a fist if you already have a piece of paper in your pocket, Pekka Tiinane.
The atmosphere varies from side to side in the employees' camp.
Is it to call the government back, or to make a deal with it?
On Monday, the Allied Directors of the SAK broke out holy hatred for the government of the Republic.
All of Finland was threatened to shut down.
Well, that's what spread to the grizzly.
The OAJ teacher trade union threatened to close schools and day care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ withdrew: none of the schools or day care centres are completely closed.
On Wednesday, Mr Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the CWC, appeared at conciliation.
He explained that he had kept in touch with the government and that he had prepared the alternative proposal required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) as a 5% productivity gap.
Mr Sture Fjäder (Cook), President of the Akava, immediately rushed to announce that his paper was already ready.
At first, the SAK office didn't even hear of a yard.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when, on Monday, the federal leaders told us to put the country on a stand.
Finally, however, Lyly stated that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to deal with the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity gap as a target.
No wonder Palola's STK has a good relationship with the Sipilä government.
The right hand of the Palace, Director of Social Impact of STK Jukka Ideus, used to be a special assistant to the central prime ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
The fire described that the government's ay-knowledge has been improving all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took a little away from the Finnish stoppers, whose foreplay was the ACP Marko Pieainen (sd).
It feels a little funny to put on a fist if you already have a piece of paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18:00: Added information on Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Sergei Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
According to Sergei Naryshkin, the President of the Russian Duma, Mongolia is better than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in Ulan Batori, the capital of Mongolia, where Narysh also gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July Festival.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had been forced to flee the European Union, to a meeting - something that the President had set out to remind journalists of.
We believe that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again. Narysh also stressed the news office in Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where he had been prevented.
The sanctions are political suicides from the EU, the Naryshk Proclamation.
The Russian delegation reached Mongolia, so Narysh also continued to poke Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed with constructive and positive results, unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Narysh has also met Ilkka Kanervan (cok), who leads the meeting in Ulan Batori, which according to Russian media has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "Paints in tight"
Tappara and Clasp continue today in Hakametsa for bull days when both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipates that today there will be no actual festival of goals in Hakametsa.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to pick up the 3-2-prolonged victory of KalPa.
The rise was masculine, since last season's silver group was at its worst out of two goals.
The lock was more powerful on Tuesday.
The Raumaan catch was a round zero point, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any are playing the same game as last year, Clasp-scraper Janne Lahti anticipates settings on the club's website.
It's a playoff nightmare for the Irons.
In fact, during the previous two years, the Tappara has just dropped in the middle of the final series of the Clave.
A decisive seventh match has been required on both occasions.
Last season, the Clave took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three by and past.
There are no major changes in the compositions of the groups except for goal guards.
Both the cashiers who rejected last night will be on the cashier's shift today.
With the goal of killing Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Bearhus, and between the lock-tops Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
View: A bad play on an ace
Toivola, the sports director, wrote a follow-up that was not suitable for the main coach Rautakallio, wrote by Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky film in which he himself played the main part.
The defendant sensually put together a series of heavyweights for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a great deal of sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola wrote a restless ashtray to Pori.
The anonymous and wooden pottery went astonished by everyone at the SM finals 2006.
The team was full of anonymous, but tough, underdogs like Rocky.
There were White Indians, Matti Pori and Pele Pelto.
In the fall games, the players dyed their heads red and cut the ironies.
Hopey became a blonde.
The great TV reporter, JP Jalo, called Coach Neumann.
The aces took the winning silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The writer, Toivola, believes that this period's novel works in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports executive has built a pottery on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been rotting guys in the distance like Rocky's pig carcases at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are earned in something other than pucking.
Toivola has forgotten that the main part of Rocky VI is Pekka Rautakallion.
Karri Stone has crucified the Iron League into Sean Connery.
The iron gallery is as clumsy a major performer as Connery would have been in the original work of 1976.
There's nothing in the Iron Rock but Rocky's nickname.
The philosophies of the Iron League do not include storming and small furniture.
He appreciates the hard game, but it's a different thing to play hard than a pig.
In the last season, Garret Stafford, the Ässiens, took a bullet in the head of Jere Karelian.
He got two or ten minutes from the judges, but the Iron League put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have those who deserve to play.
I don't accept such a game, and it's not part of the ace hockey, and the hot Iron League woke up after the game with the people of the Hundred.
This season's team is strangely built.
There's trains, there's veterans, there's cops, there's bad news.
There are practically no key men at the best age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the art shortage.
How much have you been able to influence player purchases, Pekka Rautakallion?
The events of the past period have an impact on procurement and unfortunately the market situation was rather limited, and the Iron Alliance responded diplomatically.
I'm gonna put a cop under the surface.
The 1953 Rautakallio model is known to be interested in moving to Toivola's place as a sports boss.
Men's contracts will end in the spring.
The ace balance in the three leagues of the season is equal to the number of goals of 1-6.
I didn't think it was worth writing a follow-up.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santa Claus's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband when she was a teenager, they wouldn't have had anything in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under her husband's guidance.
Yes, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She's been married to Tuukka Temose, an ex-bassist and director of Abilanna since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but for the first time, Olga plays under Tuuka's direction.
The role of Olga in the film You made a beautiful film about the early years of the Abilanta is the drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka plays and supports her son, even though her father Risto (presented by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be a sound of reason.
The more I have become acquainted with my true example of Sirka, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Touka for trusting me on the role.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the twin has come a lot closer.
They've met, they've spoken on the phone and they've been communicating.
The circus has helped so much.
We've been through a lot of different corners of their history.
Fortunately, the circus also understands that drama is a drama, and the truth may have to be a little colored.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Aussyland would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, it was a recession, and it was really tough.
There was a little chance that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells us that she had heard a lot from Tuuka about her youth even before the movie plans.
However, parents ’ stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you're doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from Tuuka, known as Heinola’s infamous skateboarder.
Olga was a regular and kind girl who wouldn't have had anything to do with Tuuka.
At most, she could have been secretly in love with him.
Olga says he's worked so hard with Tuuka over the last 10 years that a big joint project isn't afraid.
Everything's always been great.
Now the entire production team will go to Heinola for a month.
True, a couple living in Iti often plan to drive home for the night because of their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, only to ask which streets and when they will empty us.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive drama film in Finland
The budget of Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is EUR 17 million.
The shoots will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola begins filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Scifie film The follow-up of Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become the most expensive drama film ever in Finland with a budget of EUR 17 million.
In the past, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation, which is being done, will also rise after completion of Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over EUR 100 million.
The film by Timo Vuorensola and by Tero Kaukomaa begins in October at the AED Studios near Antwerp and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
I'm not afraid of the giant budget.
I've been so sick, I've been so loose!
I'm so relaxed about the file script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize that we're doing something we've never seen before.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to get this movie shown to the audience, he'll tell the evening paper.
Originally, 8-10 million had been planned for the film budget, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story.
However, 100 million could be inserted into the film because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now it's all turned so tight, there's no loose air.
On Wednesday, the film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a mass financing campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of 4-8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Son of a bitch or cool?
Big logos go back to their shirts
The trendmakers' fronts have recently been decorated with big logos.
Some time ago, a fashionable dresser avoided clear and large logos like Crocs on a console.
The branding of the hood or t-shirt was seen as a junta.
But times change.
Sport has become a real megatrend of fashion, and so have old, familiar sports fashion characters such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the cool wave.
And, as so often before, the funny and trendy line is waving: if something is right, it starts to turn into ironic and cool.
At first came the norm core trend, that is, the fashion of tavis, where trendsetters surprised the most boring basic clothes as if it were a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of a grey basic college, the sweatshirt buried on the bottom of the closet, before which the manufacturer's logo appears, will be inserted.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas is also recognized by trackers, favorite team gaming shirts and New York Yankees hats have also made a return to the street fashion.
Now, Calvin Klein's logos are a cool detail.
The trend also seems to be moving from sports stamps to luxury brands.
For example, the front of Versace’s fall blouses makes it clear what brandy clothing is involved.
Would you be willing to introduce logos in your dress?
The Russian politician published the evidence: I was not stuck in the tank for hours!
It is argued that a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia's Arms Expo, which presented the Russian military industry's products, was held in 2015.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colourful claims that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to remove large-scale Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even published an image on his own public Facebook pages where he seems to be looking at the hatch of the armored vehicle in very good moods and, at least, on the basis of these images, it is not about getting stuck or angry.
It's all nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the armored armored wagon, but it was an assault armored wagon BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, Colonel, I have served at Ural.
I went in there, looked around me and came out in peace, and Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I wasn't stuck, and I really didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian army television channel that he wanted to see Russia's new technology in the exhibition because he was himself a professional soldier.
That's why I'm interested in what's inside the wagons, and I'm looking forward to our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And at the next show I definitely intend to visit all the tanks and all the storm tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the journalist who wrote the matter stupid.
One fool wrote, and everyone else kept repeating.
There was nothing like that.
I went in and came out.
I'm tall and ratty, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen, he said to the Russian sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photo of the alleged demise has been published, although a total of 50,000 people attended the arms exhibition in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started with a case of the Bloknot.ru site where Zotov was told that he was out of the tank hatch when he tried and threatened to shoot everyone around him if he didn't get away with it.
Later, the website Bloknot published a follow-up story in which the organisers of the exhibition told about what had happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his large size, simply stayed when he came out.
But he never sat there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Alexander Pisarevski Bloknot.

There has been a leak in the Kittilä mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand pool into its well.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the leak.
The pool contains neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water for the foaming process.
In general, the water is either re-used as process water or, as authorised, transported through a surface watering field to the environment.
The bleeding rate was estimated to be approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leakage water meets the current permit conditions.
That's all that was in the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been observed to cause structural damage to the dam structures of the pool.
The company tells us that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuopamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published by the IMF today largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation en routed Finland to comprehensive structural reforms to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contractual system and unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank’s main economic owner Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a great deal of message for government action, but on the other hand, there are warning words about what should not be too much cut.
These are, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to the economic message.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts a 0.4 per cent growth rate for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
Today, in its new cyclical forecast, Danske forecasts that growth will remain zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have had the most recent observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing slightly in the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
It has been possible to pay less attention to industrial confidence or to other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences are only a few percent decimals.
Nintendo, who recovers from death, appointed a new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, working under Iwata, who died of cancer in July, began her work on Wednesday, Nintendo told on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the game industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for launching a successful Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that was raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, assesses Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's mission is to bring Nintendo into mobile games, but it does not eat the company's bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that hundreds of children have disappeared annually.
Among other things, SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported this on their websites, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minors disappear every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, Senior Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants disappear "under country" per year?- A total of 156 minor asylum applications were made in 2013 in Finland.
They lost 9 of them.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196 and 11 of them disappeared.
The reason for this loss may be that it is clear from the examination that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue to deal with the matter in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will be found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were decided to drop out of the application because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last year, he says.
Is there an increase?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum from a single minor.
Overall statistics on missing minor asylum seekers do not yet exist this year, but the number of minors is known and has grown clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What will happen to those who have received the conversion decision?
Will they also disappear, for example, into the 'dark labour market'?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as enforcement of conversion decisions is the responsibility of the police, Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of Home Affairs Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unreported people who are trying to enter the country.
He's taken action.
At the EU Minister for Home Affairs, Orpo spoke on Monday about practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen is selling Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of the devices
The equipment used for television and radio production by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, the media pioneer who lost his ability to work due to the illness attacks is now on sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuto.net, which was once the most advanced equipment for professionals.
It's the first time I've ever heard of an online ad in the Iltamacasin.
Today, much of the equipment is left behind in technological development.
In the digital media world, TV shows for Betacam tapes are no longer filmed.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be people interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer that up-to-date, but it is also necessary for as long as there is an old generation of material that must be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of amateurs, collectors, and the designers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are trying to move away from their present Stormland home.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I've slowly started to invent and see what's left of the goods.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use of TV and radio equipment.
After recent strokes, it is clear that a man who has made a long career will no longer return to his working life.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are now being sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life work was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to the box store to pick up films and other materials from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to derail worse than thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Today, the drivers of the metro and trams decide whether to extend their efforts in connection with the demonstration of Friday.
The original plan was to stop the metro and trams only for the occasion of the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be up to you whether traffic stops all day long.
Mr. Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is great in the field.
Nocturnal and tidal surgeries are ardent to drivers, so the government plans to cut supplements are a source of resistance.
Horvonen wonders, however, that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop by Friday, public transport in the capital region is almost entirely stopped.
According to VR, trains do not travel between six in the morning and six in the evening on Friday.
There will be no local or long-distance traffic on Fridays.
Trains that left before 6:00 a.m. will be driven to destination.
According to HSL, most buses are left behind.
The ACP members are absent from work on Friday morning from 3 p.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday morning.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven, they will be driven by the driving force, thought by Pirkko Repo, the informant of HSL.
Repo says HSL can't tell you exactly which busses go on Friday.
The Wage Organisations will organise a big demonstration at Helsinki Railway University between 11 and 13 p.m. on Friday.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, says AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled under panic.
According to local media, Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas. The teacher thought a self-righteous watch was a bomb.
In Texas, Texas, 14 - year - old Ahmed Mohammed has been arrested since the teacher regarded the self-righteous watch he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to introduce his electronics activities to his output.
But one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation finally ended with the boy being taken to a youth detention cell in handcuffs.
At no point has Mohammed claimed that he had made the clock.
Yet it is still possible that the boy will be accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police had said the clock looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in police custody, but it was known to consist of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident happened last Monday and Moham media was punished for three days on forced leave from school.
His father is angry about the case, and the American-Islamic Council of the country is wondering whether the case is another evidence of Islam in the United States.
Great Britain - Director Labour refused to sing national songs
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is the enemy of the monarchy.
The criticism put forward by the right-wing press has also been shared by the representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, thought the Labour Representative Kate Green at the BBC's radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
At yesterday’s Memorial, the British Air Force pilots were respected in the battle against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official opinion and stresses his respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We all owe enormous gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood silently during the national song, and the opinion was highlighted.
Corbyn's election as a party leader has divided the ranks of the labour.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, ending austerity and increasing public spending.
For the first time today, Corbyn is due to appear in Parliament as a party leader in the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
When the week went by, Cameron was on Twitter choosing Corbyn as the leader of the party.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, your Prime Minister's advice in his own account.
The cause of the family death of Minnesota is still unclear. The father of the family was waiting for the trial.
The South Lake Minentonka Police have been investigating the family death of the Minnesota Greenwood family for a week.
The five - souled family was found dead in their home on September 10th, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
After he shot his wife and three children in the shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
According to this report, the police visited the house and found Short’s family dead in different parts of the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Millions of houses and a successful company
The South Lake Minentonka Police Chief Michael Sitar's case is still under investigation.
The motive for blood work is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In 2014, at the StarTribune interview Short reported that there are four million different visitors to the site each week.
I've been offered 50 offers over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe someday I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, in 2011 when Short’s family bought a crazy house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised at Zillow as a car collector’s dream: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also an adequate garage for eight cars.
Case pending
According to StarTribune, the father of the family was waiting for the trial.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various pre-preparation courses, had sued him for the comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Short’s website had not removed any pre-preparing comments, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short’s business.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffees
In addition, the owner’s trio was awarded at the therapeutic event with the Finnish hippos monthly horse owner’s prize.
It's great, Loiri commented in a good mood on her honorary chart.
The festive Fabric Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist legend, Loiri, was still confused by the success of Fabrice Duo in the grand competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the success horse’s coach, Korpi, will find full employment while working with the horse.
The pekka will decide where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I keep my mouth shut, Loiri laughed.
"The greatest donation ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6.7 million euros) to Montreal Children’s Hospital.
According to the hospital press release, this is the biggest individual donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban and the Canadiens made an eight-year-old deal worth $72 million.
Subban’s donation is thus significantly higher than his $9 million annual contribution.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will receive a lobby with his name on it from the hospital.
The Canadiens players have, in the past, provided significant help to local hospitals.
A year ago, long-term Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a giant sum of money for another city's major hospital, which provided the hospital with a PET scanner for cancer research.
You can order a wife from a coffee shop in Japan for the night, serve only bikinis for food, and an essu on top.
The theme cafes are tough in Japan.
The market already has a goat coffee place, a chicken coffee place, a vampire coffee place, a fish coffee place, and now a wife coffee place.
It strikes the lonely, the social, and the hungry.
It's the Metro news.
You can order a wife or husband for the evening from the Tokyo Ore no Yome (my Finnish wife).
It's a waiter pretending to be a client's spouse.
"Parties" are selected from the list before coming to the cafe and he prepares and serves food.
She's up against the Essu and the bikinis, and the husband's on tight bike shorts.
The website provides all the information about the length and the weight of the wife’s application to the kind of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: attacks on car security began to take place
The Automatic Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in the sector, says Intel’s newsletter.
The panel is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will update the report on the basis of the results of the study carried out by ASRB.
The international ICT research and consultation company Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share network-based data.
We can and must improve the cyber security of cars, says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators for data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs approximately 52 000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS has been waiting for years as a moon riser.
Finally, the car is beginning to be in sight in Finland.
Ford released RS data now that the eyes of the car world are at the Frankfurt Car Exhibition.
Ford's new four-wheel RS speeds up by 2.3-litre, 350 horsepower motors in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
The price is also interesting by Finnish people, it is provisionally reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is now available for order, although the time when the first cars arrive in Finland will not be mentioned in the notice.
The popular brand, Kia, introduced two novelties at the Frankfurt Car Exhibition - such as the new Sportage and Optima
A new fourth generation Sportage is certainly more important by Finnish people than two new ones, with which Kia intends to catch a larger wing of the ever-growing street SUV market.
The new European design director, Gregory Guillaume, is more circular than ever before.
Between the axles and the outer dimensions, one centimeter has come here and the car splits the air more effectively.
The engine range is essentially unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo, which develops 177 horsepower, has been added to it.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance, as well as consumption, is reported closer to the entry for sale.
It will have to wait a little longer, as we will receive the new Sportage in spring 2016.
Even before the year changed, new Kia Optimats came to our country.
All of a sudden, the news doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of high-end buyers with better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher quality equipment.
Optimises equipped with 1,7-litre turbodiesel and 2,0-litre petrol engines are available.
Next summer, the speed will accelerate when Optima GT, equipped with a 2.0-litre turbo engine, arrives next to them.
At the same time, when it comes, Optima will start selling.
Chisu came back to the stage, and he'd come back, and he'd come back, and he'd come back, and he'd come back, and he'd come back, and he'd come back, and he'd come back, and he'
Singer Chisu will attend the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric blue pantsuit has a spectacular, open neck opening.
The costume is a beautiful demonstration of the band's waist of the singer star.
The whole is crowned with a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three - year break, a singer who became a mother has been punished with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will be one year old soon.
The singer published his first single album in August.
Back to the stage and getting up in front of the public after a long break is not really exciting for me.
I've missed everything I've done with music, the singer tells me.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release his new album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, you wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will.
Kim Kardashian's style of motherhood amazes me again - now I see the breast
True-TV beautiful Kim Kardashian gives a lot of stuff to talk about one after the other.
She presents her pregnancy stomach and bra in sexy clothes, last night at 1:00 a.m., when she left the husband's Kanye West gig with her sister, Kourtney Kardashian.
The black maternity dress is transparent to the breasts.
It exposes the skin-colored bras under the dress when the lights are flashing.
Last time Kardashian dressed up in an Amazonic maternity home, she visited her friend for a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The costume was highlighted by black over-generation boots.
The third special maternity uniform is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when there was a pregnancy stomach on the show.
The tough laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to shorten the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary "Speaking Dolls", where Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths clean about model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar collected six hard truths from Leloup behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if in the previous season you had posed in the costumes of top designers, the new season begins again with castings.
And every season comes with new, fresh faces that compete with the crackers for work.
Models rarely have a place to call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take a year to stay in a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses host their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just one kind of weight loss.
An agent in New York may ask for a drop of pounds, but in Paris, they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is always a game of chance.
In fashion weeks, the models and designers are always together and act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks are over, the difference is a hoax.
The models want this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but the fact that everyone thinks that the work is just a presentation of clothes is a matter for them.
The models also want to be their own.
The work makes the models feel like they're actors who have a role to play.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
The models for the Tory Burch show last night.
In New York City, fashion weeks are currently being held, where designers will reveal their collections next year.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Assistant musician in the film
Roope Salminen will present Antti Lautala, the founder member of the band in a film based on the early years of the Abilanta Group.
The Lautala was founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but resigned from the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I've never wanted to meet the right Antti before the shoots, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly unknown to people from that group, so I think it's really good that I'm only learning her play style from the video.
I don't want to make an impression of a person.
A man piloting Roope Salminen and Dogs is not going to play.
The punk-mangers come with a man by nature.
In the "Stars, Stars" section of the punk, I'm sure many people saw the taste, as well as if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but we always go full.
The main actors of Tuukka Temonen, who played the bass between 1993 and 2004 were announced today.
A group of young actors who have become known to the band are still quite unknown to the general public.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temo Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a tip about her future laundry yesterday evening when she mysteriously told Snapchat that she was preparing for the most important day of her career.
Roope has already published yesterday in Instagram a picture of his new category, which he has had to make for the film.
Roope, seen earlier in mustaches and jaws, has shaved his face into silos and dyed his brown hair into black hair.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think in recent days about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees who are seeking to live in Europe.
Or should I tell you about it at all?
There is no need to speak about this, Mr Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR crisis group, advises psychologists.
Smaller children are worth protecting, for example, not letting them watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in mind and distress, he says.
However, if the child has come across or heard the news photos of refugees on television, it is worth talking about.
It is good to have a discussion about the child’s starting point and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fear of a child may be surprising.
They're not necessarily the ones a parent thinks he's afraid of.
You don't want to scare a kid in vain, even if you're being harassed and scared.
The younger child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the discussion, the child too will feel safe.
Bigger children are likely to encounter conversations about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to take matters into consideration with them if a child is to be considered.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with children, can wonder how our family feels about this.
In the end, though, do we feel that the world is a safe or secure place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from distress, if possible.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult things, the child will have a model of how to deal with the challenges in life.
This can be useful to him in the future.

It's hard to control the ballland that hits the vermo.
Perttu Pohjola was able to sand the Apila Pallosalama into a stun in the middle of the summer.
It only gave way to profits and number twos until the end of July the collapse occurred in the ravines of Tampere.
Since the slave was completely clogged, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered time from the vet.
The explanation for the extinction was found on the watch.
The horse had an infection of the throat.
The disease was not the least of the head, but it took two courses of medicine to overcome it.
Since the Apila Pallosalama had to be in a light exercise, the Nordic Republic says that he is positively surprised by the recent horse race.
It was the second SE in Turku after the Taruntuulu.
Apila’s Pallosalama was very under pressure from a time when it could normally only be driven for a few weeks.
Considering those things, the slight tendency at the end was understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a good competition made the slave sharp.
The horse’s violet must have moved on from it, and I hope it would have evened out.
Apila Pallosalama has been called humorous horses.
When it hasn't been fun, it could've thrown fat without disease.
On a good day, however, the Ori have been desolate by such lightning that the opponents have been amazed.
At short speed, rivals can't handle the ball bottom, from which even warm-blooded rides will come off.
In the hope of the North, Vermo has a fart.
However, it is a different matter how the Apilean Pallosalama agrees to do so.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it might stick under the boom of the starter car and stuff.
I hope the slave is calmer than he's leaving Turku.
Apila’s Pallosalama can also come from the bow while in good condition, and we’re going to drive it for victory, Coach’s permission.
That's why you can't get rid of useless iPhone programs.
Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future, but not all of them.
Apple is likely to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, says the CEO of the company Tim Cook Buzzfeed interview.
Apple’s iPhone contains a number of programs that are relatively rarely used: for example FaceTime calls, Journalism, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook says that removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple’s iPhone applications worked closely with other programs.
There are other programmes that do not work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating because the company doesn't want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Euro area inflation fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, or 0.1% year-on-year, with Eurostat reporting by the EU Statistical Authority today.
The rise in prices was driven downwards by lower prices of energy.
Eurostat thus revised its forecast of 0.2% slightly downwards from a few weeks ago.
In July, the rate of inflation was 0.2 per cent.
The so-called basic inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate of basic inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the EU-28 was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
Of the euro countries, consumer prices rose most, i.e. by 1.4 per cent, in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest by 1.9 per cent in prices.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the EU's Harmonised Index of Indexes.
Euro area inflation is still a persistent distance from the European Central Bank (ECB)'s target of a 2 % rise in prices over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
In the coming year, the rise will rise to 1.1%, with the central bank forecasting in its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Fed will try to blackmail monetary policy next.
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more certainly within three years after the country’s central bank Fed is again starting to raise its interest rates for a long time.
And on the financial market, the downfall begins before the next recession.
Fed has suggested that he will start the interest payments already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can hit the top of the clock by next autumn and as a course of financial markets before then.
Or at least this will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets work the way they have been used to - and if they react to the blackmailing of Fed's money withdrawals, as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been drawn by the German bank Deutsche Bank’s London market research strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in its extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed the Long-Term Asset Return Study study to its international customers last week.
The strategies that drafted the study and report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will start raising interest rates or what happens in the economy and in the market thereafter.
Instead, through the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, they present how the economy and the market have behaved in the past at and after the Fed interest payments.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at which key economic and financial market variables are now on the same or different model as at the time of previous interest purchases - and what might be the result.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more humanitarian condition to withstand the rise in interest rates than ever before in the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession may not be a year.
Over the past summer and early autumn, the leaders of Fed's monetary policy and its respective institution have suggested that the time has come to raise interest rates.
The first raise for more than nine years can take place already this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Management Committee meets to decide on it at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised his so-called Fed funds steering rate in June 2006.
At that time, the relatively regular, but at a time small 0,25 percentage points, which led Fed to raise its interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%, ended for exactly two years.
The financial market symptoms began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the USA, and one year later, the financial crisis broke into a global day of judgment.
The major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious difficulties in the financial markets and the real economy began at a slower pace than has typically occurred since the previous interest payments by Fed.
Similarly, the trials were then tougher and tougher than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have screened the rises and declines of the world's largest economies and financial market developments since 1950 and, in places, since the beginning of the 19th century.
They will report on Fed's interest payments and their economic and financial impact since the 1950s.
The fastest time to begin the recession is less than a year, most often less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The rate increase on the financial market has been completed within one to two years of the start of Fed's interest payments.
Since the beginning of the 1950s, the Fed has increased alternately and decreased its control rate by a dozen different cycles.
Each time is somewhat different from each other, and the coefficient is relatively limited in the review, so it is hardly possible to conclude anything for the impact of the subsequent interest payments.
The strategies therefore remind us that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
The interest rates are too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, even though the guilty may not necessarily be identified by decades of research.
But three things about the leaders of the crisis and the causes that have increased its destructive power, I believe, are somewhat undisputed:
1) In the 21st century, Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks in the world considered their steering interest rates to be too low for too long.
They were spotting the technocouple, and they grew the next one.
2) The debt accumulated in various parts of the financial and real economy over the decades and previously too high a level of debt increased even more due to the impact of central banks' overcompensation on monetary policy.
The largest debt bubble in economic history was born until then.
3) In particular, the madly cheap debt financing, which was almost packaged in the financial economy, increased the largest exchange rate bubbles in the economic history of most parts of the financial market from shares to shares in real estate, debt securities and commodities.
It is unlikely that there will be a very severe dispute that the rising financial market for ever more complex debt flows was in a rarely dangerous and unstable state of affairs when Fed and other central banks were driving up the interest rate.
The debt-based financial structures, however, did not last until after the interest payments had started and the cost of debt financing had risen.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis and were followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategies do not guess what will happen next, but give the subject of nucleus by mentioning, for example:
1) The Fed and other large central banks have now kept their monetary policy even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
( 2) Debt has not been madly cheap for a long time, as ten years ago, but at the very least, debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt burden on the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now, in various parts of the economy, the debt burden is more severe than before or before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity that has been issued at a lower and lower cost from central banks has largely remained on the financial market and has slowed down key securities and assets to the most expensive peak since or never before the financial crisis.
And not only are the strategies of the latian climate with warning signs on the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not recovered from the financial crisis and from the worst recession in decades to come.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but accordingly, the pressures and risks on the financial markets are disproportionately higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts to tighten his money supply tighter.
Perhaps the picture of Albert Edwards' future of Societe Generale's strategy is not as strange as it may seem.
For a long time, he has trained the Bank's international investor clients for the following full translations:
First Fed raises interest, then the financial bubbles break out, and soon it'll be time for Fed to turn off the financial pieces with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is planning to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed towards HP’s business service party, the company says.
HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., based on pcs and printers targeted at consumers in November.
HP’s workforce was highest in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records one-off costs of $2.7 billion (approximately €2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce 250,000-30,000 workers.
Consumers' reductions will remain in 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees will be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company reports that it has already balanced its business in such a way that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its business performance.
In the second year, the three most significant customers brought 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: How to get a new operating system after Apple's update
A new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, clicking "General" and then selecting "software Update".
If the update is ready, the phone will allow you to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems since this installation when a "software update failed" error has appeared on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to update via iTunes.
The phone will guide the user in the final process.
This may include removing applications for space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process with a new tool that proposes the applications to be removed and then reinstalls them when the update is completed.
It is worth ensuring that the phone is loaded or the charger is near during the update, that the battery does not run out.
If the charge level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, because if the battery runs out in the middle, it may lead to an update breach.

It is also worth ensuring that you have gone through our list of all the things you need to do before download, so that things don't go wrong, and how you can protect yourself from them if they go. iOS 9 brings new features, such as a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity properties for iPad, as well as improvements that speed up and repair the operating system.
Yle: Minister Berner has been a member of the board of the tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Tax Paradise Company.
According to Yle, the company's activities were linked to so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo company, which was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself says that he has filed a resignation notice in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to file a divorce notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed schedule, says Berner at the Yle interview.
Membership after merger
Through the Luxembourg company, the ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed.
Kährs is a floor manufacturer, which was merged with the Finnish floor manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served as a government of Karelia-Upoflor between 2010 and 2013 and after the merger with the government of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings go through a multi-port ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted membership of the Luxembourg company at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been in the government of the Karelia Upoflor owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was contacted with a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the capital benefits of the Finnish family company were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income of our Finnish companies' capital is taxed in Finland and that it was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership in the company is not subject to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in tax havens is due to the fact that Triton, the largest owner of Kährs, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
In Espoo Otaniemi, the first reception centre maintained by the company is opened for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 people already today from 6 p.m.
The number of seats can increase in the next week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will set up a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue College.
The activities are maintained by Luona Oy, which is particularly concerned with the production of healthcare and health care services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STK is preparing an alternative work-life tightening package
St.T.C. is preparing an alternative package for the government's work-related tensions.
The organisation also wishes to see other organisations of the employees' centres.
According to President Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing the price of work are then returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out to journalists during the meeting of the organization’s administration.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Business (EC) does not, on the other hand, have the capacity to debate.
Economicists of STK have calculated that the change in the government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated 30 million euros when the other half of the package is 2 700 million.
I do not know if the party is terribly keen to have a conversation if there is one relationship on the side of the hundred.
Palola: A constructive negotiating link
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has called for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to submit a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing reforms.
The Palola did not comment on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a connection to the government, and it has always been constructive of him.
According to Palola, the CWC at the STK field is a painful place, especially for Sunday supplements.
The organisation requires that the government withdraws from binding legislation to implement part of the blackmail.
According to Palola, the STK does not allow an alternative package to be prepared with the SDP that has been present.
Employees meet in Helsinki on Friday to resist the work-life tightening package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the wages of the first days of sickness are cut, the overtime is reduced to half, the Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced.
With regard to the RTD, it is stressed that the central organisations have invited wage earners to express themselves and that there has been no intention of organising a strike.
Akavan Fjäder says thank you.
Mr Fjäder, President-in-Office of the Akava, thanked the Stek report on the preparation of the alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STK is now on the same lines with Akava, as an alternative model for government presentations has already been outlined in Akava.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
Mr Fjäder, President-in-Office of the Akava, hopes that the SAK, led by Mr Lyly, will come to prepare a presentation as an alternative to surgery.
Antti Palola's STK reported earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Akaka announced that it has long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate a 5% competitive leap by the government as an alternative to surgery.
Akaka has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long written an alternative model for government presentations.
We are prepared to look at the terms of service as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Akava lines, as STK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing a model for the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
On Thursday, 15 a.m., the Akava Bureau will take a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the common coal, the soles" playing bingo while Sipila talks tonight
University of Tampere Green Left
The Viva Bingo Cup of the Green Left of Tampere University for the evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional talks during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will exceptionally speak to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on the channels of Yle at 21.05 p.m. on Wednesday night.
When applying for the previous Prime Minister's speech, we must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio talk, which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the President and the ministers gave a number of radio speeches during the winter and post-war period.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen closed the train performers' strike with a television talk.
Single talk, monarchic meinink
Sipila's speech has been a source of criticism and conjecture throughout the day about what to do.
On Twitter, President Paavo Arhinmäki said that "The Sipilä could speak about the state of the nation in the parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, so that the speech could also be discussed".
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "one call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the SDP's Erkki Judgments condemned the "monarchist manners: the Prime Minister tells the people what's best for it".
Antti Rinne, President of the SDP, challenged Sipilä's dialogue: "A long six months of elections.
Not a single performance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What's @juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and will take about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it is commented on live by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EC CEO Jyri Häkämeis.
It has been criticised for giving Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it is part of the public service mission to promote the overall publicity of Finland, and that the director of Yle’s publications in the news of Ismo Silvo Yle.
Like Me in Tammeloi's day
The speech has also raised ridicules.
In the evening, the dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be combed and dressed for their best.
My mom puts on the prettiest vulture and my dad puts a tie on his neck.
At 9 a.m., we'll be quieted down to television as we used to at the time of the Tammels," wrote blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also tell in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens with millions of millions of millions who are hiding their capital, who are drawing up pardon laws for their other tax-circuiters and, at the same time, claiming to the people that it is necessary to cut when the state has run out of money?" says Pia Lohikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the University of Tampere Green Left Viva.
It has published the bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat, the same coal, living as debts, and the same team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21.05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: The Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to set aside al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer by which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have given up power, says President Martti Ahtisaari to the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian United Nations Ambassador proposed a plan that would allow al-Assad to move away from power in an elegant manner after some time.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
The Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent member states of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurk listed three points of plan to him in a bilateral debate: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition had to be contacted immediately, and the abandonment of al-Assad had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we are able to discuss it openly.
I told him what I was doing there, and he said sit down there, Martti, and I'll tell him what we need to do, the Ahtisaari will remember at the Guardian interview.
Diplomates do not comment
The island of Ahtisaari reports that he has passed Tshurkin’s message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate to the paper, but according to Ahtisaari there are no two words.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that the Al-Assad troops had already committed several massacres at that time and that the main opposition groups refused all the agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the British Foreign Ministry's Middle East Department, takes the view of Ahtisaari's speeches with hesitation because, according to his experience, Russia was at no point prepared to discuss the fate of Al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest part of the claim made by Ahtisaari is that Tshurk spoke with Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speech, I would have said that I would like to hear the same thing from President Vladimir Putin so I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even in that case, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's trick to keep the power of one of Al-Assad's supporters.
The refugee flow of our own actions
During the negotiations on the island of Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had died in the crisis in Syria.
According to the UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of the current year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own action.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we're paying the bill we made ourselves, the Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Organisation centre for asylum seekers with a knock-off to the Tornio
The organisation centre for asylum seekers designed by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the building of the tower’s cohabitation in the centre of the city.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better manage the refugee flow from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat announced on Tuesday that the Board of Governors would have already decided to present a school building as a status solution for the Ministry.
According to Sauli Höppinen (left), Vice-President of the Tornio City Council, this is not true.
When the entire council was not assembled and some of the crew wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite a council meeting to decide on the matter next Monday, he would specify to the STT.
There were 36 of 43 delegates at the local meeting.
The organisation centre was opposed by 13 delegates.
On that basis, you could expect the decision to be positive, says Hyöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and a rapid reaction was made.
It is estimated that 500 asylum seekers would be able to join the community at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is two hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense too, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä is still hoping for an alternative to blackmail in the labour market.
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä, halving the public holiday money would only deal with part of the government's aim of lowering the price of work.
However, the government will be happy to accept the alternative package if such agreement can be reached by the social partners.
Sipilä told the journalists in Parliament that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
Nor did he know how serious the organizations were looking for replacements for the cuts in the government's work force.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, halving the holidays would be a way to act, because it would target almost all wage earners in contrast to, for example, the Sunday supplement surgery planned by the government.
The social partners could agree between themselves on the operation of holiday money, because they are included in collective agreements rather than in the law.
On Wednesday next week, the government will report to Parliament on the pressure on working life in the form of a Government communication.
According to Sipil, the proposals made by the organisations should be known before this happens.
This is not the final end of the line, either.
The legislative work will then start to move, which means that the train is on the move and it will be more and more difficult.
We've got a lot of time.
It won't take long for such things to come, if there is a will, Sipilä put it in shape.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of the slopish and helatorist into unpaid holidays without reducing the annual working hours.
In addition, the wages of the first days of sickness are cut, the overtime is reduced to half, the Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced.
The reforms will be implemented as a forceful legislation through trade unions, which has raised strong criticisms.
As a result of these actions, wage and salary centre organisations are organising a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political attacks.
The Tohmajärvi Council approved the extension of the juice hall warehouse
The Tohmajärvi Board of Governors unanimously approved the extension of the warehouse of Nordic Koivu Oy, the hall of juice hall.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than the one originally mentioned.
Also, a busy schedule hearty.
It was also little wonder that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, an extension of the stock by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the financing will be decided at that time in the context of the interim report.
The agenda also included an investment of between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000, but at the meeting, technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be approximately EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis of the fact that it brings work and tax revenues to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays for the investment as a rental, Vesa Viistö (ps.) justified.
There is also a place for Karelian language in Joensuu
The city government alleviated its previous strong position to bring the street signposts in the Karelian language to the city centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the preservation of the herd’s tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it, and the Karelian language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastern Savon dialects.
Even after the new decision, no street sign in Karelian language will enter the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also ready for use on a case-by-case basis, for example, in information boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same attitude to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single-language municipality, the use of the Karelian language should also be given an open mind now that the multiculturalism lives and changes strongly even in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the entire forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can well be used in the region’s various marketing activities.
The derailment of train connections is cutting off the vitality of the province
The cuts in the train connections strike the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the economic life and competitiveness of the region.
And that depends on whether or not you can live and work here at all, the mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also highlights air transport, which has also been followed several times in the report.
It is important for the whole of the region that we do not have the means to reduce our chances of doing this through state measures, as is now the case.
We should look at the impact of the abolition of these transport connections on, for example, employment," Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of traffic connections is a further challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, Principal of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot for research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Director of Recruitment, says that it is already difficult to market the university towards Western Finland because the connections are weak in a transverse direction.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside of Eastern Finland.
About 10-20 per cent of them are from New Zealand, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of the sound of gravel for the battle of Siu
The City Government of Joensuu's vision of the regional Siu Sote project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel sounds is amongst the number.
Pentti Keskalo (in the picture), a member of the City Government, presented the government's rejection of the entire project at a Monday's meeting, but his presentation was unprofitable.
The Government approved the draft decision of the mayor, Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the meeting of the City Council, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from the Eagle to Kouvola will end next year
Rail transport from the Eagle to Kouvola will continue, although one train is less than one train.
There will be changes to passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train shift is missed, but five times a day is still available from the Eagle to Kouvola and vice versa.
The reductions are due to state-owned savings measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’s purchase fees for the next four years will fall by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely completed.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys were snooping around.
The rescue facility let a 12 - year - old climbed from the climbing roof, who couldn't get off the roof on his own.
The situation took place on Ketotie at 6 p.m. Tuesday night in Tornionmäe.
There is an old two - storyed wooden house with no ladders on the roof.
It did not stop the boy group who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of the radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, the rest of the people swung from the scene and the passers alarmed the rescue facility to help the last person on the roof safely returned to the surface.
FedEx’s operating profit is twofold, lowers the outlook for the tax year 2016.
FedEx reported depressing results in the last quarter, and delivered a full year’s performance forecast, due to reduced demand for freight services and higher costs for its ground services.
The company also said that it intends to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50 000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Its share decreased by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx Corp. says it expects next May to end the tax year with a result of 10.40-10.90 dollars, which is 20 cents below the previous forecast.
Analysts waited for $10.84, according to a factset survey.
In spite of the average price increases of 4.9%, which will enter into force on 4 January, and despite the higher additional charges that started in November for heavy or large parcels.
The company said that it expects the operating profit to increase from the previous year because they have cut costs, the turnover has increased and the online trade is on the rise.
The president and CEO, Fred Smith, said that the company "is firmly engaged in economic conditions that are weaker than expected, particularly in production and global trade."
The plans for wages and salaries for the holiday period were published the day after the competitor OPS told us that he was going to hire 90-95,000 extra workers, about the same amount as it hired last year.
In the quarter ending on August 31, FedEx had a profit of $692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
A profit per share came to $2.42, which is left with an average estimate of $2.44. The 12 analysts survey was carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
Turnover rose by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks' survey, six analysts were expecting $12.23 billion.
In recent years FedEx has suffered from a reduction in international priority transport, which has halted the development of its Express unit’s turnover.
However, the increase in e-commerce has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the net sales of the land unit rose by 29 per cent, but in principle the revenues of the operations were the same due to the high cost of larger packages and the insurance of their own.
The revenues of the Express unit were higher due to higher basic charges, while the operating profit in freight operations fell by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx’s shares fell to $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
FedEx closed the record on Tuesday 11 per cent for this year and 17 per cent for the 11th of June.
This week, the decision-makers of the U.S. Central Bank will sit around a huge table of mahogany for two days to decide whether the time has come to raise the interest rate for the first time for almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank’s decorative, two-storey meeting room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that Janet L. Yellen, the Governor of the Central Bank, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
Congress has placed two kinds of responsibility on the central bank's shoulders: they must maximise the employment in the United States and keep prices stable.
However, since the great recession, the Governors of the Central Bank have agreed that there is also a third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted, that the decision on whether the US economy is ready to dispose of a record of the short-term interest rate that has been almost zero since the end of 2008 .
Although most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, the recent surge in the global financial markets may have made the pre-scrupulous officials of the central bank concerned even more alarmed as regards the increase in instability, fearing the impact of raising the federal funds rate by at least one percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important things to be monitored," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economic expert at the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for justification for keeping interest rates back, the increased uncertainty on the world market will have sufficient reason to wait," he says.
The decision taken by the central bank has not been agreed, which is already a source of nervousness to the economy.
According to a recent study by Bloomberg, about half of the financial experts predict an increase in interest rates this week.
On the other hand, the financial market expects the central bank to delay the increase, as the key indicator shows that the potential for growth is only around 30 %.
This refers to a fall in the securities market if the central bank increases the level if decision-makers do not then manage to soften the impact by promising that the next increase will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose by 228.89 points, i.e. 1.4 per cent, with a new figure of 16 5998.85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the central bank would keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, chief financial expert in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank is raising interest rates right now," he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, "they must put a lot of effort in their direction to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argue that the increased level would calm the financial markets down because it would remove the uncertainty as to when the central bank would operate.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards slow-monetary tightening, which would confirm the stability of the US.
Mr Yellen said in the spring and early summer that he expected the level to rise this year, despite the fact that the liberals are demanding more economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1 per cent, which is the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the limit of full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of acceleration.
Although inflation is still below the central bank’s 2 % annual target, the central bank’s decision-makers say that access to it will have a significant temporary impact on the price of oil that has decreased.
The economy is "supervising and also needs higher interest rates, taking into account the strict situation of the labour market", says Ian Shepherdson, Chief Financial Officer at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial market around the world was shocked last week by China's devaluation of its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index fell by up to 16 per cent of its May record, when investors feared that China would slow down its global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the peak reading in May.
For the decision-makers of the central bank, market fragility is an additional factor in a complex equation, which tells us because interest rates need to be raised.
"Without these financial market events and the news of recent weeks about the weakness of the Chinese economy, decision-makers would tighten up the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, specialist researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers will wait at least a month to gain a better understanding of the effects.
"The potential impact on the US economy is still quite unclear and they do not have much information at their disposal as to the consequences of the events in China," Oliner says.
The well-being of the international economy is not the main concern of the central bank and should therefore not affect decision-making in principle.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
In 2013, the instigation of the then president, Ben S. Bernanken, that the central bank could "reduce" the amount of money, caused market upheavals all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to develop elsewhere but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The decision-making process of the central bank is "more art than science", says Zachary Karebell, head of the global strategy of the asset management company Envesnet Inc.
The President of the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Reserve Bank) of the State of Virginia, Richmond, pointed out this month that "the central bank has previously overreacted on financial market operations, which seemed to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy."
The Federal Open Market Committee, which takes decisions, has called for interest to be raised, and Mr Laker, a member entitled to vote, calls for an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
The economic crisis in Asia caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings "in spite of its limited, identifiable effects on the economic growth of the United States," says Lacker.
A year later, the central bank reversed these operations.
The central bank should give priority to economic stability only during the major crisis, as was the case when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest fixing committee.
The latest mullerry does not come near its level, Posen states.
"No one wants to see a situation where interest rate increases are feared because the market is upset," says Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a twofold requirement and does not mention economic stability, as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazil’s Children’s Disease Organization in Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet for breast-feeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a shocking way of trying to get women to understand the importance of good nutrition during lactation by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts with images of unhealthful food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients needed to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, the new study suggests that increasing calories is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Professor Robert Waterland at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually appears to be a genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unwelcome diet was found to have a negative effect on the infant’s immune system.
Seven-channel Sunrise is a favorite audience, despite Nine-channel attempts to advertise in Today's Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's attack on Canberra to announce the post-reports of the Liberal Party's leadership failed to increase the number of viewers today.
The Nine-channel morning program was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull took over Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, run by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of its week-long series of international broadcasts, covering also Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance to the printing works did not seem to bother Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise’s average number was 397 000 in five state capitals, compared with 339 000 today’s number.
Today's average rose slightly compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but was still lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has caught Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, today’s average was 318 000 and Sunrisen 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40 000 and 50 000 viewers.
For the time being, during September, Sunrise has an average of 349 000 viewers, while today's average is 314 000.
This is the most interesting event in the morning.
The changes will blow this morning, not just in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The Seven-channel’s big news was the 800-word series, with the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which collected an impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with two of his children.
Critics have been wondering if Thomson is alone with a popular show of power without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The results of last night gave this a real assurance.
Seven-channel The X Factor program was a strong favorite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning The Block series (838 000) and TBL Families series (726 000).
Seven-channel had two kinds of fate on the second night of The Chase Australia series.
The first half hour (17-17.30) of the new screening program, launched by Andrew O'Keefe, collected a mean of 446 000 viewers.
Another half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623 000 viewers, which was a small enough victory for Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the average number of the first half-hourly viewers in The Chase Australia was 520 000, and the second half-hourly viewers had a peak of 720 000.
Hot Seat's average was 620,000.
The fall in the second night’s mean value of The Chase Australia brings the Nine Channel confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the number of viewers in the McGuire programme.

The final three agrees with the fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who won the Bachelor series.
That woman's identity has been kept extremely secret with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls really don't slip who got the last rose.
However, when we were talking to Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could unwittingly give a hint of the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips have been sealed before Thursday's finals.
All three women were poetic when they told me how Wood was the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
However, when asked, "If the last rose of Wood is not for you, to whom should it go?", their answers may have revealed who won the bachelor's heart.
Both the Jeavons-Bellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since the first day.
"From the moment I walked into the house, (Sarah's) energies and Sam's energies seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind for the whole series," Jeavons-Felllows said.
"Sarah is very close to earth, it's fun to be around him," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They feel comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks that she and Sam Wood would be great together.
Mackay said that last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I'm in this with all my heart now," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if he didn't, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the remaining girls as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on the Ten Channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start her NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in him after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have been asking about him since his impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some trainers would have left Hayne on the bench for the final game after this Australian rugby League turn-off dropped the ball in the first time the team got back on the flight.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Haynen return the next flight and took him to the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
The real character of Tomsula was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his newcomer a Battalion in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
Special editor Cam Inman of 49ers reported that Haynea was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the ball he dropped and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a plane shot that Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter of the game.
This was certainly not the beginning that Hayne and her numerous Australian fans wished for the man's NFL debyyt.
Haynen was seen cursing on the way from the field after the fall, and later he told the Australian radio teamer Hamish & Andy on the 2DayFM channel at 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"Now it was just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and it's there," Hayne said.
Hayne compared her haparation with her 2007 Origin Debut, when the entry into her own target area led to the Queensland goal.
All in all, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed her Instagram account in a photo with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovski, was arrested with a gun on the Siberian runway.
Khodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was sentenced, his oil company Yukos was seized and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 died shooting rubber bullets against protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four - year - old boy, died in southern Nepal after police shooting rubber bullets at a crowd that expressed their opposition to the new draft Constitution, the authority reported on Wednesday.
On Tuesday evening, violence took place in the Rupandeh area about 175 miles west of Katmandus, the capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the highest official in the area, said that more than 1,000 protestors had gathered outside the police station, some throwing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then fired in the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty cops and five civilians were injured, he told us.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
In the last few weeks of violent demonstrations around Nepal, the members of the Madhesi ethnic group said that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group calls for its own country.
Since August 10, violent confrontations have killed at least 40 people, of whom 11 have been police officers.
At that time, the four main parties signed an agreement that divided the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial matter in Nepal, which has had central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators speeded up the process since the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
This week, the legislators have voted on the draft Constitution clauses in Kathmandu, and the authorities have said that the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
The National Hurricane Center of the United States of America NHC says that south of Cape Verde is a 60% chance of a hurricane.
On a wide low-pressure front, about 560 km south of the southernmost part of the Cape Verdean island group, there is a 60% chance of developing into a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours, reported the National Hurricane Center of the United States on Tuesday.
The second sharply controlled low-pressure front, located in the middle of Cape Verde’s island group and the Small Antiques, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical hurricane in the next two days, added the Miami weather forecasting centre.
Google launches a donation campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations that help thousands of refugees who have entered Europe in their escape from war-breaking and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when publishing its donation campaign in its blog.
Instead of making the announcement, his personal experience was written by a Google worker, Rita Masoud, who, when he was seven years old, fled Kabul with his family.
"Our journeys included numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and dark," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But once the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
Donations receive four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google reported that it corresponds to each donation made on Google.com/refugeelieref worldwide up to $5.5 million, with a total target of 11 million dollars.
Europe is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven over 4 million people from its homes this year.
Many people also flee from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, which are wretched by war.

Weight loss can help mildly overweight diabetics
According to the new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery in patients with mildly obese type 2 diabetes may be at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight loss than those treated with other treatments than surgery.
Dr. Robin Blackstone says he's a weight loss expert who wrote the headline for a new study in the JAMA Surgery periodical.
For weight loss or bariatric surgery, different methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach bag.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of subjects in the study have been obese and their body weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
The BMI, i.e. the weight ratio to the length, is considered normal when it is between 18,5 and 24,9.
If the BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the BMI is over 30, he is considered to be overweight.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital, Taiwan, used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, stomach bypass surgery and stomach loss, type 2 diabetes medications in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the mean BMI for the cut subjects fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, those who were treated with other means than surgery remained largely the same in 29 C.E.
Of the patients who were cut, 36% had a complete and 28% improvement in diabetes.
In comparison, the overall improvement in diabetes was only 1% in the drug-treated group and some 2% in the treatment group.
In addition, the blood pressure, triglycerides and the "bad" LDL cholesterol " were generally better in the surgical group", the writers said.
In addition, patients were monitored for blood levels of A1c which reflect long-term blood sugar levels.
Haemoglobin A1c should be maintained at less than 7%, with investigators writing.
After surgery, haemoglobin A1c fell from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, it remained stable at around 8% in the medicinal product group.
However, this better "glycemic control", as described by improved levels of haemoglobin A1c, did not reduce mortality over a period of five years, says Chief Researcher Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared mean results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared with the gastric surgery group, the gastric bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), had lost more body mass index (7.4 and 5.1), had a greater decrease in haemoglobin A1c (3.1% and 2.1%) and had more likely achieved complete diabetes remission (46.9% and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix’s Blackstone says that although research does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where surgery led to longer lives for more serious people.
The Swedish study found that obesity patients undergoing weight loss surgery had a 29% lower chance of dying over a period of 15 years compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not seem to improve the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging for people with BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
"The results of research are crucial precisely because they show that the surgery is safe for the lower body mass index group" and does not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that weight should be taken very seriously by both patients and their physicians when BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The head of Tibetan Buddhism has called for the end of violence in the refugees' countries.
The Dalai Lama discussed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain.
The Dalai Lama claimed that, in the present situation, the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual peoples or even of continents.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is also insufficient.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria for their efforts in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime we must think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development into these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In taking a stand on the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the U.S.'s violent response led to the violent events in the chain.
"After the 9/11 Father, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used power and it produced unexpected consequences," says Dalai Lama.
In the last four years, children’s swallowing of hand-infectants has increased fourfold.
Poison data centres across the United States have reported an increase of almost 400% in the absorption of alcohol-containing hand-in-handicides in children under 12 years of age since 2010, reports Georgia’s Poison Information Centre.
According to the Director of the Georgia Poison Information Centre, Dr. Gaylord Lopez, cases of disinfectant in children under 12 years of age were raised from 3266 cases in 2010 to 16117 cases in 2014.
“Children are more interested in these products, and unfortunately a certain percentage of them are assigned to the emergency services,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children were deliberately drinking disinfectants, while others wanted to impress their friends or respond to the challenge in social media.
There are videos in YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectants to get cheap hops.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed the disinfectant with oral water containing alcohol in order to obtain a stronger drink.
The smell of a pleasant disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The kid doesn't think it's bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (handicrafts) are those that have been added to it.
There are strawberries, grapes and orange-producing disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
A hand disinfectant may contain any alcohol between 45 % and 95 %.
Especially in young children, alcohol poisoning requires just a few injections.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," Mr. Stephen Thornton told Fox 4 in Kansas City, head of the University of Kansas Poison Information Centre.
So you wouldn't leave a whiskey hot on the table, but you're left with a hand-disinfectant, and if the kids are interested, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhajah Russell is a six - year - old girl who, some time ago, swallowed only four sprays of strawberry products with hand disinfectants at school and was taken to emergency care.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the limit of adult driving, says an emergency clinic doctor Chris Ritchey, who took care of the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
When you were talking to her, she couldn't walk when she got to the emergency room.
The doctors followed him overnight in a separate children’s hospital for possible symptoms of brain injury, for alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," said Nhajah's mother, Ortoria Scott, to CNN.
It could have been a deadly situation for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and move the disinfectant away from children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a hand disinfectant containing a toxic non-reported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of the state of New York, three fourth - graders planned to poison their "bad" teacher by spreading bacterial poison to the classroom, reports the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and denied it in his class.
The police need to prevent the plan as a "compulsive nonsense" and leave disciplinary action to the school community.
Rumor: Celtic has no conflict
Mr. Griffiths is ignoring the talk of the Celtic conflict, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but she's making it turn.
Hearts is fighting the Scottish football union against Neilson's accusations, and Warburton is alert to January recruitments that may interfere with the unity of the team.
Dons raised his lead to Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's first half-time penalty kick took Aberdeen to a narrow victory from Hamilton at the Pittodri stadium and allowed the team to raise the difference to five points.
Mr. Griffiths is a little bit of a discussion about conflicts.
There have been rumors of internal conflicts between Celtic, but Griffiths immediately passed them. He claims that he and his teammates have no sense of working under closer supervision when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of the Scots Championship to bore the Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers middle-field player and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they have no competition with Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador, de Boer, said, "The maintenance no longer shows the highlights of the Celtic games, and why?"
Because Rangers aren't involved.
People here just can't talk about Rangers' return.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
These teams have a lot of tensions in their games, and also non-Scotlanders want to follow those games.
Deila swears she'll turn around.
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to reverse the situation.
Lose Malmö and the resulting fall from the Masters League quickly resulted in a loss for the ten men who played Aberdeen, which is now at the top of the series with a five-point difference.
But Deila said, "Celtic's had bad episodes before, and we're getting up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
Indeed, we need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton will be guarded by January player transfers
Although Rangers-boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible points for January player transfers, he is careful of the most recruiting to assure that he does not want to confuse the team's consensus.
The former boss of Brentford said, "The moving window of January is very different from the window of summer."
For players coming in the summer, the entire time of adjustment is the previous time, which is shown in our team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic’s interest in Michu points to a recovery
Swansea's attacker Michu, whose name is attached to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has indicated that he can retire after his contract with Swans is terminated.
The 29-year-old player has had ankle brains for two years, and during the summer he was unable to find new company outside Wales.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish football union because of Neilson's comments.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team disappeared after this 3-2. The defenseman's red card was later cancelled, and this was already the third red card condemned by Collum in the last eight months, which was repealed.
Neilson stays behind his message saying, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on the performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastlea
The loyal Hibernian player was to be repulsed after he admitted to singing an offensive song about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in the pub at the Edinburgh Roseburn, before the Edinburgh derbya Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was a moment's drive", the attacker said, adding, "It's safe to say that I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I move on to play for Celtic."
The Tannadice government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United government still has faith in the leadership team's ability to reverse the situation, but admitting that the weakening of players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back together," Donnelly says.
McInnes will be happy to win the "rum" Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Accies, but was able to achieve his seventh consecutive league victory thanks to Adam Rooney's first half-time penalty, which raised them to the top of the table five points above Celticia.
McInnes says, "There is no team that would have won anything, whether it was a trophy or a league that would not have won games this way."
Scotland's unemployment remains the same as the United Kingdom's total increase
EMPLOYMENT In Scotland, 164,000 remained in the period between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of the UK rose to 1.82 million in total.
The rate of unemployment in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than in the UK 5.5 per cent, with the figures of the National Statistical Centre (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over a three-month period, and the number of employed persons is now 2,612,000.
During the quarter, Scotland's employment rate fell to 74%, which is higher than the United Kingdom's average of 73.5%.
The Scottish State Secretary David Mundell commented on these latest figures: "The long-term plan of administration is to build the foundations for a stronger economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
During these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why I witness execution in Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention at all, I will be watching the man be executed later today.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'm sitting at the viewers' gallery in Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glosip be executed with a lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received a request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I'm starting to freak this day out as it approaches.
So why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and since applications are often more than free places, participants are chosen through a terrible value.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places reserved for the media to twelve.
Whoever's chosen is watching the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also established my own connection with him through the calls made over the months and through one two- and a half hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I can't have a notebook and a pen with me to record what I saw.
All I have to do is try and remember all the details.
A reporter in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter that I had compromised my neutrality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants you to participate.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that "he could have done his word better", but he still believes that what I am doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He won't tell me what to write, and I won't do that if he says so.
I've told him he can take me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to write about it.
If Glosi dies, he believes that publicity will help to counter the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is right next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to a series of podcast broadcasts I've done.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would, in any case, make him guilty of assistance.
But I think there's a very strong chance he's not committed murder.
I'm sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And so this is the perspective I think he's gonna die from.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other journalists here who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of what it's like to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
He was lured out of the Canning River after a watery police hunt.
Officer Canning Vale remained dry when he lured a man out of the Canning River.
A man from Perth's attempt to distract the police went wrong when he found himself in a shallow, muddy water just a few feet away from a cop who tried to "peel him gently back to the beach".
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday because of an unauthorized invasion of Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to mislead them by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He stood in the water saying, "I'm not coming out, come get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used safer tactics: "a proper police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things when trying to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, the Cousins abandoned their car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He failed in his attempt, but inspired the locals to start designing a playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the officials tried to spy on him and threaten to stop competing.
Peter Moody has claimed that the officials of Racing Victoria tried to infiltrate their spies into his deposits last year and threaten to stop competing immediately.
On Wednesday, Lady Tatai's late rejection due to the treatment procedure on the day of the race was the last rivet.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition and that he has been in a difficult situation after the unexplained positive cobalt sample of Lidar.
He has kept his tongue under control for a year and a half with regard to the claims of a spy, and he did not want "it to look jealous".
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it's so frustrated that everything's going to go down at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation would continue.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to keep my head up, and I want the owners to think I'm doing my best to them.
When they start thinking differently, I'm not supposed to go on as a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped a bomb on a racing.com site in an interview where he told me that the integrity department had been trying to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man when I asked him to name him, and offered him a job on my safe deposit if he gave me information about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, it's true they should fire their lawyers, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current Chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at that time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps pass on responsibility to non-trainers for what is happening in this area?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that harmful to the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that now things are going to make them think about it.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really makes me sad.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
Coach's frustration has grown with a long-term study of Lidar's cobalt, and the late rejection made him say, "I could throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for coaching the undefeated master of Black Caviar, has called the rule of day-to-day treatment "magic" after the mud or clay has been put on the horse's feet, which is irregular.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees put mud on his leg in a mistake.
It could have had a bark last night.
It could have had it yesterday, just like it had.
It had it on the day of the race.
Moody may face a three-month ban on competition due to day-to-day hatchery, from which officials started a study.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about a horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Driver responsible for transport in Cobra arrested
The police have arrested a man who committed a traffic jam after he ran into a cyclist in Cobram this weekend.
The cyclist was transported by plane to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he was seriously injured when he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police told me that the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia reported himself to the police at Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, of neglecting assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
The Melbourne Storm team coach Craig Bellamy attacks competitors in wrestling claims
The Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised the two NRL-rugby League champions for claiming that the battles of his team would be part of the "principle".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the divorce judges allowed Storm's "pain" on his side when it suddenly won the finals in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely covered up his reference to Storm after he won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the finals. Bennett called the game rugby League a "show window" and said that two of the Queensland teams were not very excited about the wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's struggles and said they were just focusing on "Contact" fighting.
Bellamy added that his confidence was increased by the criticism of the two leading coachs on Storm, which means that they fear losing to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost them 24-2", Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or technologies throughout the year, and in the last six weeks we have only been stressing contact in battles, and that has made us succeed.
Trent has been on the team for three years and clearly has a great team to train, so he is probably not used to losing, and so this was a little shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of a "thresholding rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett-trained St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "unfortunately".
Wayne's talking about exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 when St George was often criticised for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he's got a team that can play the kind of rugby we find exciting, especially when he's got fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have the type of players.
He brought it up on the side of 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not who on the team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I will become more confident when they say such things because they are a little concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as an answer to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more spotty than the game between Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it a breach of the exciting defence line and a failure to finish the goal?
For me, this is about guidelines.
If they mention us, it means that we can play against them somewhere.
The Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to home games against either the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night's prefinal in AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
For Serb man, $200,000 bail on drug charges.
A man threatened with a possible life sentence of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released against a bail of $200,000.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men arrested last month after the federal police had traced 100 kilos of drugs to the Solay yacht that came to South America through Vanuatu and was shipped to Comera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting other accused people at the boatport all morning, and then he met them at the Comera Roadhouse coffee shop where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in the Toyoa Echo car.
Although Maximovic is threatened with a possible life-long business for the possession of cocaine, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maximovic tried to hold the entire amount and that he could have been in the cafe for purely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has close links with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about the place he lived.
Maximovic’s mother and stepfather had jointly offered a $200,000 guarantee to secure his release.
"After reading the sworn certificates of both persons, it is clear that setting a guarantee of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
But alone it was not enough to prevent him from showing up in court, he warned.
Maximovic was guaranteed on the condition that he surrenders his passports to both Australia and Serbia, reports daily to the police and adheres to his ban on movement between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures.
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl asking for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this phone while she was sleeping and then logged in to the online communications service, where Hogg received numerous immoral pictures of children sent to her by another user.
She woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
She looked into her phone and found shocking messages, and then immediately she told her mother.
When the police came, they saw five pictures, searched the computers on the site, and found "scarious" online searches using search methods that had been used to search for immoral images taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this to "happy pedophiles" on the Internet before he "played himself a cop to scare them".
Mr Robertson, Member of the Fiscal Deputy, told the Dundeen Sheriff's Court this: "He said that this is an addiction - that he is dependent on intimidating people.
He admitted that he had done a search on his computer, but said that it was only because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so he could scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about discussions with an unknown person who sent him the pictures, and when Hogg asked him to send out additional photos.
Hogg said he only did this for bait.
He said after drinking, he's sick and wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she yelled at her mother, she was shaking and crying.
My mother saw the immoral pictures on the phone and then met the defendant.
She was interviewed and told that the defendant had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
23-year-old Hogg, living on Ward Road in Dundee, accused of producing or taking pictures of immoral children on 14 June last year. He broke the guarantee on 25 January of this year and failed to come to court on 24 March of this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be entered in the register of sex offenders, as it can be claimed that his crime was not a "markable sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October so that the social services have time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was guaranteed in this case, but in other ongoing cases, he is under arrest before the hearing.
He was added to the sex offender's record before the day he was convicted.
Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe, gave the wrong speech to Parliament
This year, the oldest leader of Africa, Mugabe, fell earlier this year on the leading steps to the speaker’s upheaval.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the crash was spread like a virus in social media.
Parliament's opening ceremony was also stained by the claims made by the opposition's legislators that they had been sent with anonymous threats to the death, in which they were warned not to budge to Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they banged and interrupted him by interrogatory calls when he gave a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Group Superintendent Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones that warned them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The number on which the message was sent does not answer, but the title of the message is 'death'," Gonese told journalists after Mugabe spoke.
The message warned the Members concerned that immunity would end in Parliament, and when they resigned, parliamentary immunity would not be valid.
The group leader said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is ' concerned' about threats against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, distinguishing its computer and printer business from its faster-growing business equipment and service activities.
The expected job cuts will result in a cost of around $2.7 billion starting from the fourth quarter, said the HP press release.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, the President of HP and CEO, who will lead the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that will help companies move to a new kind of business," Whitman said.
As a separate enterprise, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover will be over 50 billion dollars, and it "focuss on producing peer-to-peer integrated technology solutions" for companies, says the company's press release.
The division is breaking down the company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, graduates from Stanford University, founded in the 1930s to manufacture electricity supplies.
HP has gone through a huge restructuring to survive the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the USA, and its distribution is the latest in a sector based on the belief that strictly limited companies are doing better.
Arsenal's captain, Mikel Arteta, says teammates must support the injured Jack Wilshere before the Dinamo Zagreb tie-up.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is not until September and assuming that his rehabilitation will be as planned, there is no reason why he will not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshir will miss at least four of the next games in England, and, given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European championships next summer.
The biggest pity about this latest problem is that the end of the last season of Wilshere was strong after an individual’s ankleier, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten your career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as also Wenger admitted, the player trying to return through is always at risk of additional injury.
There is also an uncomfortable model in the formation.
Studies carried out by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, he has played Arsenal’s 157 league games in only 65 games during the last five seasons.
In view of Arsenal's wider overall after the period 2007-08, six out of eight of them have been one of the Valoliga teams who have lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger recognises the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their improvements in disability statistics for the past season will continue.
"Sometimes when you return from the injury can be a prone season, when you need to strengthen your body and acquire competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilise, I am sure that this will happen and that he will have the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his Masters League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, playing next Saturday against Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arte are likely to be at the outset.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and give a break for the players who need it," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is a clear extension of Section F, Maximir’s stadium in Zagreb is one of Europe’s most frightening.
Dinamo has also not lost 41 matches since they produced their own "Unwinnable" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked on Tuesday night by an earthquake of 3.2 on Richter’s scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned from last season's Masters League surrender against Monaco, and he is still motivated by the distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I know how to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about male friendship
It is striking how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than those of fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain and is three times more common in men than in women.
In the company to tackle the problem Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 for men. The goal was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendliness is at the heart of this challenge.
The recent study included over 2,000 upper secondary and secondary school students who showed symptoms of depression. The study showed that the possibility of a person recovering doubled if a high enough percentage of his friends was "well-being".
Similarly, those who were not depressed had a halve of the probability of possible mental health problems if they had healthy friends.
But for friendship to work, it has to be available first.
In this social media through communication time the style goes past the content and the immediateness of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, although in reality isolation prevails.
This surface success is dominated by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All of this is at the expense of the personal growth and friendship of internal values - the inner desire for personal values - which have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money certainly does not bring greater happiness.
The French's fineness was precisely that it turned this focus on the top of the head.
No character was defined by their work, but rather by their personality, clearly distinguished as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs, watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can identify with all of this, even though they often hesitate to study their feelings completely.
As Samaritans volunteer explained to me: ... when I listen to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I have truly understood how the smallest interaction with a friend can make you feel better."
Often, the men who contact us feel they can't talk to friends.
The old idea of overcoming is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up from problems, you will be seen as weak.
Frendit is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer you more long-term means of survival.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.

Di Maria's doing the finish and helping PSG hit Malmö's side
Angel Di Maria is celebrating paints against Malmo with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan.
Angel Di Maria scored the Masters League in her debut, helping PSG pass the Swedish team on Tuesday.
Under the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his Masters League game with a comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo in Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made a goal in the Masters League's debut for less than four minutes, pointing the way to the French league champions, but the team lost many opportunities before they finally added their advantage when Cavan hit the goal in 61 minutes.
Paris, in the same section A as Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetski, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, because there was not only a follow-up in the game, but also an improvement in their quarter-finals-leading games in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took the score, it wasn't a classic game, because Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, lost the place in front of the finish line and was later replaced from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and that team where he started his great career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or in guests in the Masters League, so a 2-0 win creates problems for the opponent and looks good in statistics, and there is a good start, although there are things that we have to work out this season," Blanc said.
This is good for you.
We wanted to win and win, even though I regret that we failed to score one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team one of the three changes made after the team remained in 2-2 evenball in Ligue 1’s home game against Bordeaux this weekend, but he remained in Di Maria’s shadow in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine winger was appointed as a man who will take PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran into Marco Verratt's feed behind Malmö's defense line and then hit a beautiful finish across Johan Wiland to the back corner of the net.
However, if someone expected easy and high profits from PSG, he would be disappointed.
Malmö was a clogged opponent. He won the Celtic match when he reached this level, with nine international players and five-man defenses in the opening field as well as two players in the deep middle field.
But on the offensive side, the team offered little more than the 34th minute of Nikola Djurdjic's launch, which went past Kevin Trapp's goalpost.
On the other hand, PSG was sometimes in trouble due to lost feeds and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, which failed in a total of five companies only during the first half and then was disappointed when Cavani inserted the ball from Ibrahimovic’s contact at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in pre-working his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic’s feed that Di Maria sent a twist that tilted around Wiland’s goal at 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally achieved after one hour of the game thanks to the sixth of the season struck by the Uruguayan Cavan, after Ibrahimovic had plucked forward from the left of Maxwell's cross feed.
It ran out of Malmö's wishes to get back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant fight for David Luiz's direct kick kept the final numbers down before the switch came to Ezequiel Lavez's goal was abandoned at the end of the game.
The coach of Malmön Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said, "Our last Masters League game was last December."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which is not the same level.
I don't think it's enough to be in a fight.
I'm gonna put my hat on Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion for stock sales
On Wednesday, the mine industry in Switzerland was left by Glencore, which suffered from a collapse in the price of basic goods, and collected $2.5 billion by selling shares as part of its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, announced in a notice that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57 % of its market value this year, is struggling with the prices of the collapsed commodities, as the slowdown in the Chinese economy puts pressure on demand and destroys all markets.
The new mark raised the value of Glencore’s shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange in the Wednesday morning shops.
The shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had revealed $2.5 billion in stock trade as part of its broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by about a third last week.
The company sold a new share capital of 125p, which meant a reduction of 2.4% to the final price on Tuesday.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, worth 9.99 per cent of the merger.
The concerns about the long-standing decline in China's growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while the prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington.
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make state visits to the United States at the end of the month, the White House's opinion on Tuesday confirmed.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on 25 September and is the answer to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, said the opinion.
The President of the United States and his wife, Michelle Obama, will organise dinner for X and his spouse Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
"Principal X's visit gives the opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a number of issues of common interest in global, regional and bilateral matters, while at the same time giving President Obama and President X the opportunity to discuss constructively issues with differences of interest" was added.
The first visit published in February, Xin is also expected to depart from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet a number of U.S. technological leaders before continuing to reach New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyber spying and the increased country's conditionalities in the South China Sea's controversial waters.
Matt Damon minimizes the difference in filmmaking
Matt Damon joined the African American filmmaker Effie Brown in discussing a difference that Damon said wasn't needed behind the scenes.
An actor from the HBO Sunday evening Project Greenlight interrupted Brown in emphasising the need for different perspectives as regards the dark main character of the script selected for the project.
"When we talk about difference, it's taken into account when choosing actors for the film, not for the show," Damon claimed.
Stunned Brown reacted with an unbelief, with comments on "Wow! Wow. Okay," while The Martian's actor's comments were stuck in the air.
Other producers, Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers, joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
"I want to tell people to think about whoever the director is, how they treat the Harmony character," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark character he's got is a whore that's been hit by his white pimp.
The Dear White People's producer called for the right to direct the film to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied harshly that their direction "can end up giving us something we do not want".
After the conversation was sent, the social media exploded to disprove Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr.Pooni expressed his anger at the film game, writing: "Matt Damon speaking on the only dark person in the room and explaining to him the difference is so white that it happens."
After his publication, Twisting collected over 5,000 rewitches and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments are at a time when the precise racial presentation in the media is at the forefront of the social debate.
Following the murder of a teenage Michael Brown by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement became nationwide and called on legislators and authorities to put an end to discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the release of the Year album candidates for the Grammy Prize.
"The albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of Black Lives Matter recently published an opinion to answer Elisabeth Hasselbeck, the TV face of Fox News, as to whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It has just been reported that Damon is involved among entertainers, producers, and media moguls who have been invited to visit the pope to discuss the picture of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the pope.
First American Ninja Warrior crowned
The professional bicker and vessel collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete on Monday who won the American Ninja Warrior and won a million dollars prize.
It is precisely in the competition programme which ended its seventh term that there has never been a competitor who could have survived all the parts of the barrier to the programme.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
The last task was to climb a 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge on time, making him the first ever athlete to figure out the exhausting 4th part of American Ninja Warrior. But Caldiero figured out the challenge three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero gave the interview to E!News after the hard win and was still in shock for winning the $1 million prize.
"It's great to think of this when I've never made a living or made a living for up to $100,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what this will be... the future is unknown.
Production Director Kent Weed sat down and talked with The Hollywood Reporter about the finale and why Britten won't get more reward money, even though he's the first competition ever, who's managed to cross the track.
The rules are that money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money will be given to the one who has the fastest time," said Weed.
Even though money is a great reward and changes life, he still gets a feeling of great satisfaction.
I don't think that's why he feels bad.
He's just so happy he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family man.
He's the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I believe that Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior will return to the eighth season, whose descriptions will start in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaked past Minnesota Twins
Minneapolis -- the other half of the season hasn't been so much fun for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers used to be one of the best baseball teams, but now he's the last in the American League Central division.
Tigers played his role perfectly on Tuesday when he won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost a chance to get to the end of the game from Houston Astros in the second place in the American League's wild card.
For Detroit, the game was to return for at least one night to the six-letter H-word, which had been very difficult to reach most of the latter half of the season.
"All the winnings are fun, no matter how we get them," said Tigers' team leader Brad Aumus.
Tigers feeder Alfredo Simon continued his early attack support when Detroit ran three times in the first two pairs, followed by the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) baited 6 1/2 in the gear and let three runs go.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending for this year," Simon said.
It's hard for a changer to feed every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers' replacement hit Victor Martinez three times and allowed two runs that were his first run after mid-August.
This was Martinez’s first three-beat night after he hit the Seattle Mariners four times on July 6.
"He waved well," said Aumus.
He looked good (in punching exercises), looked much better in punching exercises and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh shift, and that was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Centriage Byron Buxton started the shift by knocking out twice on the left field line.
On the right side Aaron Hicks came home with one button, and Simon got burned directly to the second base player Brian Dozier before Simon was switched to left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked the Mauer, the only opponent, the first-to-be surrogate Miguel Sanoma, who pulled the two nests to the left of Drew VerHagen.
With two runners in the field and a level-playing runner in second base, VerHagen got the third base Trevor Plouffen to hit the double-game finish.
It was the main series record: the 27th time this season, Plouffe hit a double.
After Detroit had received a confirmatory run at the beginning of the ninth, Mauer pulled two hit runs against Tigers' locker Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
But the right-handed player burned Sano in three baits in his fifth rescue.
Detroit used Phil Hughes, who was rusty at the beginning.
Tigers got three runs in the first two shifts against a right-handed veteran player who got off the list of injured before the game, after having been out for more than a month due to a lower back infection.
"It's obvious that I didn't want a start like this," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt like I was able to make some nice input on the third shift."
After Hughes caught the beginner in the first nest, he allowed the second nest player Ian Kinsler to move forward in one time.
Walking on the right side of J.D. Martinez in the situation of two fires brought Victor Martinez on the takeoff, who took himself to the first base on the midfield and caused the first run.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 pipe while the runners were running in good running positions.
The third base player Nick Castellanos continued by hitting the right and causing another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected as he tried to move on to the third base.
Tigers continued in the second shift and got one fire, two nests in the situation of the catcher James McCann and two fires, one nest in the situation of the run from Anthony Goselta, followed by a situation of 3-0.
"It was an important shot," said Paul Molitor, the team leader of Twins.
He didn't hit very well, but he flew to the right place.
Hughes began to be in the input readings and entered an unfettered third shift, then replaced him with a right-handed extension of A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs out of six hits and a walk with four pieces.
NOTE: Tigers’ right - hand feeder Anibal Sanchez was thrown away because of the shoulder twitch.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list since mid-August due to the shoulder twitch, but he had to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, the left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris is coming from the list to start against Twins.
Norris's statistics on Tigers are 1-1 in four beginnings after the left-handed feeder David Price was replaced with him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20th because of a real tummy tummy tummy.
The three-game series of Tigers and Twins ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-4, 4.43 ERA) stands against the right-hand passer in Minnesota against Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges us to open up a wider economy to the world.
The economy must open up more to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday to direct the reform.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing a transparency policy", he said at the 16th meeting of the Group on Deeper Reform.
Supporting transparency at the same time as the reforms are driven forward to increase new movement and vitality, as well as creating new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Governing Board adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of restrictions on market access, a relaxation of the principles of border control, a call for state-owned companies to take on private capital and a review of the system of registration of residents.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created identifying sectors and companies in which no investment can be made.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant as it will give the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensure a statutory business environment and make the market more transparent," the opinion states.
The government will also loosen its control over the power it distributes to companies, thus ensuring that companies decide on how to handle their business.
The opinion also stated that China would allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open up sectors governed by the state to private donors, more sectors are opened up.
"The administration will not change its policy on foreign investment, and it will protect the legitimate interests of companies financed by foreigners and provide them with better services", said the opinion.
In addition, the search process for foreign permanent resident permits, "green cards", will be facilitated by optimising requirements and reducing the search process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the professional rights of lawyers and the support of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as the older leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in the opinion published after the meeting.
