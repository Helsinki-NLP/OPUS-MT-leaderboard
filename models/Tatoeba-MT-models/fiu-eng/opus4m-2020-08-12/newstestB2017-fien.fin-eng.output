A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a mall in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the stairs of the local shopping mall this week.
The victim's brother says that he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally got his cause in order."
The body found at the Westfield Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Franciscolian Frank Galicia, reported at the San Francisco Medical Office.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim’s brother Louis Galicia told the KGO radio station at ABC that Frank, who worked as a cook in Boston, had found his dream job when he became the chef of the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock to them all.
"We're a small and tight team, like a family, and we're very sorry," says the representative.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells me that Frank first lived in the hostel, but he had finally settled his case.
"He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend," told Louis Galicia KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and kind.
His way of being with the family was to make food for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get in a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who walked with the power.
Despite all the wrongs that happened in the world, he was a unworked diamond that shined every day," he says.
Anyone who knows anything about this case will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline number 415-575-444.
Junior doctors who are working late require new measures to fight back at work
The representatives of British junior doctors (mostly specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and requested authorisation for new work-related activities in the dispute concerning the new employment contract.
The JDC, which is a member of the British Trade Union for Doctors (BMA), is calling on the entire government to support further work efforts from the beginning of September.
According to the JDC, ministers have not solved the problem of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in a vote in July.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday evening, Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Committee on Junior Doctors, published a letter to JDC members on Twitter, where she says that the government has "obsessively silent" on issues that, according to McCourt, led to the rejection of the agreement.
The letter says: 'In light of this, the JDC Government has totally rejected the new draft agreement in its vote and calls for new formal negotiations to be held on all our concerns.
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Government has today submitted a formal request to the BMA Government requesting authorisation for the progressive work-related efforts from the beginning of September."
Because of the dispute, junior doctors have already been in strike six times this year, including the first complete work stations ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, Director of BMA junior doctors, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated contractual terms recommended by BMA.
At previous meetings of BMA members, Malawi told them that the agreement was good and should be approved. 54 000 junior doctors and medical students took part in the vote.
After the vote, Jeremy Hunt, Minister of Health, said that the agreement would come into force and concern doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met with a handshake and a formal conclusion of the eight-month war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin accepted his Turkish brother in the golden hall of his palace in St. Petersburg, I received the clear impression that the greater desire for reconciliation was found in Ankara.
The parties did shake hands,
But Putin's smile looked thin, and he didn't get too warm even by his own restraining standards.
On the other hand, Recep Tayip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of Mr Putin as his "good friend" – a report said five times.
I couldn't keep up with the bills myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I myself understood his zeal on the contrary.
But the continued whistling of Putin showed that the Russian Head of State has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time of the event was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara tightly and accused him of stabbed his back.
The insult was all the more so because it came from an assumed friend.
Getting real trust back will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
Over the months, state-controlled media had a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious were the accusations made by top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in Isis-controlled areas in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the charges.
However, the official message from St. Petersburg was that it is time to move forward.
At the end of the day, this meeting was held only so that Putin could get the apology he requested from President Erdogan.
Thus, Russia could gain some form of victory.
The benefits of declaring a severe weaponry are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all his potential friends after he was almost ruled out last month in a failed coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic influence on reconciliation.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the charter flight ban, as normally millions of Russian tourists travel to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, the tour operators and charter companies will certainly boast of relief when air traffic can finally continue.
They put their faith in the late season of the storm on the Mediterranean Sea.
And again this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall when Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," was formulated in Vedemosti's article.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because she feels that the West reacts to the attempted coup.
Without forgetting the old resentment about Turkey's EU membership negotiations and Putin's intervention in matters, which is keen to take advantage of the cool gap and to break Turkey's ties to the west.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when he expressed his support for the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was self-evident for Moscow, who has had its own concerns about the change of power.
Therefore, Russia and Turkey could, at their summit meeting in the Pramian Sea Coastal Shoes, convey a picture that was described by an analyst as a "outer alliance": two countries who experience being rejected and treated by the West combined forces.
Despite public reconciliation, the two still have major differences of opinion.
The most important is Syria, where Moscow has created an image of itself as a peace-builder, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It is much to say that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told us at the press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The Turkish President deliberately refused to answer the question of country differences, while Putin stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between the countries on where they could seek agreement in Syria.
Given the possibility of a complete disaster caused by the NATO Member State, Turkey, when shooting down a Russian combat machine, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, the two Heads of State will again be in touch.
Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from its customers outside Scotland
According to RBS, the bank’s operations outside Scotland will be reduced so that it will only provide business services, i.e. back office services in the future.
Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand originally related to the bank’s global objectives.
The bank had to back down from its goals when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that time, brand authors have used RBS to protect other consumer financing brands.
It sponsors international sports with millions of pounds, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it is considered right to have more national brands on the front.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but there will be no reduction in RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names will be converted into NatWest, with the exception of the head office and the stock exchange list.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to clients and staff at Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS is turning into an investment brand and because of the fact that our staff is employed because we are now turning into a bank of different brands.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in its own community, and our staff is working with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations, and has increased the profile of different brands in sports sponsorship.
"Now is the time to move to a bank with different brands, because it is basically a matter of how we can make the bank better for customers," says the Governor of the bank.
"It would have been very ridiculous three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and have introduced the brands.
But our work and focus on the needs of our customers, rather than our own needs, have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it's the right time."
Frankie Dettori rode Predilection to victory in Newmarket and won 3,000.
Dettori sprays champagne twice in a row in Newmarket, which meant 3,000.
Jockey Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3,000th victory at the British Championship in Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone by riding his horse to Predilection twice that night on the track of his own locality. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to achieve this milestone in a level track race.
Previously, Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
The triple champion jockey detori, who previously won in Ghayár, says, "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The event is not a big one, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a 20 000-person audience.
I'm relieved, and I feel a great humility."
Dettori will receive cheers with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the barrier competitions, and they are champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy who won more than 4 300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4 4493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is not surprising that she has reached this milestone, which few have reached.
He's elegant and strong, but his tactical superiority is what separates him from the others.
He is a fantastic representative of the race, his enthusiasm and his hard work have brought the species supporters for many years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6 000 races if he hadn't only competed on weekends and only in big games!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career in the British Games has been winning for almost 30 years, and it's been amazing to follow.
He's a lively person, which is good for a British race, but above all, he's an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori ventilated his achievement in a symbolic way by jumping off his horse.
"From flying goals to drone landings, Frankie Dettori has been a model for British racing for two decades.
There's been a lot of ups and downs on the way.
He has won numerous big games, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived a plane accident and has been banned due to drug abuse.
When the ban ended three years ago, he had difficulty starting, but he showed an admirable nature of strength, showed his suspects and returned to his best.
And for some time now, he has not finished his career – Dettor has recently said he wants to continue his career in competition until he is at least 50."
Putin was dismissed by Head of Administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for several years.
Mr Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to a statement issued by the Kremlin, President Putin " has decided to release Ivanov from his duties as Head of the Russian Presidential Administration", but no justification for dismissal was given.
As Vice-President of Ivanov, Anton Vaino, who has been acting since 2012, was appointed.
He's a former diplomat.
In 1972, Vaino was born in Tallinn and graduated from the highly respected Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he ran the President's protocol department and the government office, says the Kremlin's Russian-language website.
He thanked Putin for his appointment: "I am grateful for your trust.
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State, which means making draft laws and monitoring how the instructions you give are to be implemented."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for a divorce and recommended persecution as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This transfer has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been in the vicinity of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, has a KGB history.
As head of administration, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, shown by the Russian state television, both said that Ivanov would withdraw from the mission on his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations are only a few, especially during the parliamentary elections.
Are the fires the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the formal claim that a man who has been praised as a possible president would suddenly want to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin's website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and, to some extent, even difficult task for four years.
Now I've been the President's Chief Administrative Officer for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB.
When Putin acted as Head of the Federation Security Service (FSB) which replaced the KGB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff.
When Putin came into power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become President of Russia after the second period of Putin, as the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for the third period.
However, the mission went to another of Putin’s vicinity, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to President only three and a half years later.
The star of the Criminal Minds series, Thomas Gibson, was fired after hitting the producer.
Gibson was involved in a violent dispute at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
The series of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios reported fires in their joint release.
Mr. Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, had made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened," she says in her press release.
Information on how Gibson's character is to be posted in the next series of FBI agents will be published later in the press release of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, 54-year-old Gibson has been in the series since its first production season, i.e. since 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul in it for the last 12 years," says Gibson in his release on Friday.
"I hoped I'd see it all the way to the end of the show, but it's not possible anymore.
I would like to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production team and the most important: the best fans that the series could ever have hoped for."
The 12th series of production seasons will start in the United States on 28 September.
The mysterious shoreline of fish in the Banffian garden
Kevin Bain, in Banff, has asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain doubts that these 75 fish are wind fish that have been caught in the land by a hurricane.
Bain, who lives 500 feet [500 m] from the seashore, published pictures of the vision in Periscope and hoped to receive an answer to the appearance of these five - minute fish.
From the Queensferry crossing, Fife is now connected.
The €1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have attached the northern deck of the Queensferry bridge and the ground bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four sections between the "canyons", which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge share of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tow ropes.
The €1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The finance secretary, Keith Brown, visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from country to bridge.
Brown says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossroads Bridge.
We are all witnessing a very significant step forward in building a bridge. More than 30 000 concrete and steel have been used to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight, building the bridge section between the land bridge and the bridge is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the entire bridge is now in place, and the rest of the deck is about to be cast concrete in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted."
Michael Martin, Head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructions project, says: "The completion of the first section of the bridge is always a significant urinary column for all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the top of the road and water construction industry.
When the last part of the road cover was installed and attached to the road cover of the North Tower, then we had to close the remaining northern (i.e. the landside) crack.
This was done by drawing a seven hundred millimeters south of the northern bridge.
This was a massive and, at the same time, an operation of great precision.
Massive because of its length of 222 metres and its weight of about 6 000 tons and had to be pulled up at an angle of approximately 3%.
And it takes great accuracy because the tolerances that the working team had to comply with were very small — only a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything went well."
The Moelfre Bay rescue unit reports three men's miracle rescue.
Three men from their fishing boat outside Anglesey were saved like a miracle in the store.
Moelfre RNLI rescue station made an alarm on Friday at 1:20 p.m. local time after the accident in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim into safety while their boat continued to run recklessly without a pilot.
"We saw the boat running right next to them and imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who was driving the Moelfre rescue boat.
"By the time we got into the water, the strong winds had fortunately carried the boat away from them."
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, while the third, from the age of 60, was found exhausted with a boy and no life jacket.
They were all taken on board to the coast rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle that these three men on water are still alive and perfectly well.
The boat had an emergency firecracker in its engine, but for some reason it had broken off the boat from the man who was driving it.
They were really lucky to be here."
The Pokémon Go hunt brings health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch how the world changes.
During the last decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to stay inside looking at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Originally, the screen time was only spent watching television, then video games and the latest smartphones came.
So it is wonderful to note that technology and the foreign movement do not rule out each other.
This, of course, refers to the Pokémon Go. Pokémon Go is a game app whose characters come from a video game created in the 1990s (which later was also made of drawings, playing cards and other by-products).
As with many popular cultural phenomena, this also collapsed a little before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
Lanseration in other countries was delayed because of a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of Pokémon Go users passed Tinder and was almost as big as on Twitter.
Then how does the game work?
In brief, players will go out to look for pokémons with their smartphones, which will be monitored using GPS. When you find the pokémon, it can be "photo" (by using the phone screenshot) or "cook".
The wave has struck a generation that played a video game younger than the video game and has lifted their butts off the couch.
In the United States the game has significantly increased the number of steps taken by the "average person" per day.
The Washington Post recently reported on the Cardigram app of Apple Watch, which, within two days of the game was launched, discovered that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. The Cardigram follows 35,000 users.
The company does not know which users play Pokémon Go, it sees only the raw data on physical activity.
Many public health campaigns, which encourage people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day, have echoed to deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of physical activity should not be underestimated.
Regularly mobile, the likelihood of cancer or depression is lower.
Exercise helps control weight, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes, and brings a large amount of other benefits.
The beauty of the Pokémon Go game is that it makes people do something they enjoy.
This will achieve three basic health - support issues — exercise, fresh air, and the sun, and joy.
It's possible to make even new friends during the hunt.
As usual, this phenomenon includes adjudicating harlots of joy.
And, yes, someone can walk towards the door when they're playing.
What about it?
There's been a breakthrough.
For while smart phones such as Fitbit may have been able to track your activity in the past, they did not give any reason to move, as Pokémon Go does.
The novelty will be lost, and the use will be reduced in time.
However, the success of the pokémons will result in more games combining applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity of people who go on yachts and improve their condition and health.

Simone Biles caught gold in a multi-gauge of women's racks.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the jump.
Simone Bales is immune to all of these people.
Dynamic jumps.
I don't care about the boom.
You're gonna have to shake your jaws with a permony.
Great for everything.
And now he's finally the Olympic winner.
On Thursday, an American 19-year-old shipwrecker won the multi-game championship and raised the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics’ maze.
His overall score was clearly better than the silver-based teammate "Final Five" with Aly Raisman and Russian Bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
The United States Simone Biles will be performing in the boom at the final of the multi-stakeholder match for women's bearings in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the Summer Olympics in Rio in 2016.
The party became the fourth consecutive and the fifth American woman of all time who won the multi-game championship, thus strengthening her reputation as the best or even the best of all time.
Bales burst into tears when his finals came to light and his long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the species to a completely new dimension and brings him to the same category as other superstars of sport, such as Michael Phelps:
He has won the 15 World Championships, of which 10 gold, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programs that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest player of all time".
There was still one last race in Brazil, especially between Bales and himself and the burden of excessive expectations, not so much between Bales and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring, less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
Simone Bales (left) and Aly Raisman of the United States will hug after winning gold and silver in the final finals of the multi-gauge match of women's strengths at the Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Rio on Thursday. 11 August 2016
Bales won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point for the country team-coordinating Martha Karoly's leaving and now retired.
While Bales claimed that he had never thought of anything in advance while at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program – which includes a series of volts known as his card – has been adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic arena.
It's not a coincidence.
By the time his grandparents were young, he was adopted and Coach Aimee Boorman's mother had found a power figure. Boorman found the girl when he was on a day-care trip to the gym where Boorman was coached.
He has not lost any multi-game competition since the summer of 2013, and the victory pipeline is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a little lead on two turns, it was like a mirage.
There was a boom and a permanto where Bales is a defensive world champion.
He got back into the lead position after getting 15.433 points from the boom and crowned the final result by 15.933 points from the permanence.
Raisman gently hugged him while they were waiting for final points — a mere formality — and tears began to appear around the color of biles, red, white, and blue, when the dream he once wrote in his cutbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a minor reverberation for the four years ago competition, when he first divided third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafia in a recycle.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader that the Americans call the team "mommy" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent flight kisses to the public after his permanto program, thus rising from losing position to winning, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old's earlier tweet, made in the week and widely available, now has a whole new meaning:
The police tell us that three musics were the victims of a serial killer who had been listened to in the car.
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix’s most devastating mass murder for ten years. The victims sat in a car talking and listened to music when they were shot, reports a police release published on Thursday.
According to the authorities, a car parked on the street side of June 12 was shot by Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis’ daughter Maleah.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, where he shot eight shots with his handgun and then fled with another car, says the press release.
The police suspect that the cause of the triple death was not robbery, because the attacker did not steal the handbags or the $2,900 found in the second adult victim's house.
Phoenix police informant, Sergeant Jonathan Howard says that the police are now investigating whether death is related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks, mainly in the Latin American inhabited areas within four months.
"It is common for events to have happened in residential areas in front of homes," Howard told CBS's subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, the late 1990s black BMW and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that attacks are related and that they are the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital because of his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter, Maleah, died immediately at the scene.
The Witness told the police that the trio had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a bulletin on an empty open van just half an hour before the death of the triple, and the shooter is believed to be the same in either case.
The scientists found the shells and recovered the bullet from the car seat and the bullet fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old son with microcephalia: "Things are getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes to sing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other agemates, Edmund has a microcephalia, a born minor, which is due to the genetic disorder of his mother Elizabeth Picciutto, who she was not aware of when she was pregnant.
"When I brought Edmund home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn't handle it.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
What is not true at all – of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never recognize them or survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there was any such practice at all," Picciuto says.
Edmund walks with a roller.
Edmund didn't get up and sit down until he was 3 years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's moving slowly at his own pace.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He's happy to play with two of his brothers and love singing.
Elizabeth presents the sign that Edmund invented, which means "sing to me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, that does not only mean the usual sign language, but also includes the signs that Edmund himself invented.
Microcephalia can be caused by a variety of diseases: hereditary, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or ziquirus.
The symptoms and prognosis vary greatly.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of those who are affected by the zizavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm caused by the uncertain future.
"I kept doing: what happens to us,
"What happens to us?"
He still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prophecy in a long time, 'cause I don't think anyone can give it."
But Picciuto has hope to give advice to mothers whose children have birth defects caused by the ziza virus.
"Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Heavy rains and floods caused massive rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency due to heavy rains and widespread floods, and more rains in the state are expected on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in south-east Louisiana and south-Mississip flooded over its grains and spread to a wide area as a result of heavy rainfall.
Governor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana says that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, an informant of the Office for National Security and Emergency Response, reports that the Agency receives requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandfalls.
According to Steele, the only district of Tangi Evil has asked for tens of thousands of sand bags.
The flood warning remains valid until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to the weather service, more water may come into the area from 76 to 127 mm.
A flood warning was given in South Alabama on Friday, when the rains continued in the Mobile area.
During the weekend, near the Comite River, near Baton Rouge and the Amite River, near Denham Springs, each of which in Louisiana, is predicted to rise to record heights.
According to weatherer Alek Krautmann, many of the houses on the river may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that floods in the Ascension district constitute a threat, as flooding rivers slowly empty into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flowed south of the state border of Mississippi in Liverpool immediately, had already risen at 9 a.m. on Friday.
The rescue continued in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in Southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and grandson were earlier on Friday near Gloster among those saved.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek river, which is normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
Another part of the boy close to him had warned him.
"We got up, and the water came with constant feed," Hansford says.
"It reached my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she had lived in the area.
Hansford tells us that he and his family are all hurt, and he is the only one who can swim.
The rescue workers had saved all three large military - style trucks and had taken them to the fire station in Gloster, where they held cover on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says that floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rains continue, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells of information from an observer close to Livingston that it was almost 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil has been very wet since the rains started on Wednesday.
The authorities report that the flooding of heavy rains and streets led to the rescue of the residents of Tangihaho County and the withdrawal of school classes in five school districts.
A member of the City Council of Tank Evil had told WWL, a subsidiary of the television and radio company CBS, that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached them both.
The district leader, Robby Miller, reports that 72 people and seven pets had been rescued by the authorities who had been imprisoned by the flood.
There are shelters for evacuated people in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
"They'll get back to their homes when the water starts to withdraw," he says.
In the city of Hammond, almost twenty streets of Tangihahoa were shut down because of floods, and the residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
"The last time we experienced a great flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, a member of the city government.
"This flood seems to be similar."
In Mississippi, the rains continued flat on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, says Rupert Lacy, the head of rescue in Harrison County.
Lacy reports that on Thursday, a handful of flooded houses were reported, but on Friday, none of them had been reported.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopr Value Foods Store, reports that he has been living in the Amite region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and more rain all the time."
Several bullets in his body, six-year-old Mahah Brown, survives a shooting attack in Philadelphia.
According to the police, a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who's already another 6-year-old who's been shot in town this week.
The kid's grandparents told me on CBS Philadelphia channel that the boy is Mahah Brown.
According to his grandparents, the boy had several gunshot wounds in his groin, leg, arm, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is true."
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family informs the television company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was starting his first grade in local secondary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown district.
The shooting also involved two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old male.
The second 29-year-old was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found on the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between several armed men.
The scene was filled with weapons-type shells originating from various weapons of attack.
"It is quite clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were casings on the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
There have been several armed fighters and they have been actively involved in the shooting," Chief Inspector Anthony Ginald of the Philadelphia Police told the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and I hear the police are going through surveillance videos.
Another shooting victim in the city this week was a six-year-old girl who was struck in the hand by a misfire while he was playing outside his home on Tuesday in the district of West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
This is what I call the Olympic Team of Women's Bearings, and there are more than one causes.
Firstly, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Bales, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colorful girls.
The team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, will make everything proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were in positions 1 and 2.
This is great.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas rose as the surprise winner of the Games, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances and surprising and mastery of the three-time world champion Simone Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth successive American to win gold in a multi-stakeholder match.
Teammate Aly Raisman won the silver.
Such views are at the top of the species, but the same does not seem to be true for the whole country-wide range of the armoured strengths.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie followed the same tracks Aly and Madison formed an Olympic team.
They are the final five ("Final Five"), because the next Olympic team of the shipbuilding team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that the trainees are an expensive sport, and gymnasts train mainly in private shipbuilding euros, which are maintained by their parents. Parents are paid for training costs, facilities, travels, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (trainers, gymnasts and family members) etc.
The majority of the ship-wrecking areas are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support operations.
The teaching of the shipwreckers takes place in these clubs, and it means an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of the gymnasts.
Coach Aimee Boorman of Simone Bales and Coach Maggie Haney of Laurie Hernandez have both trained the species of practitioners since they started the fork.
We need to organise a cheaper and more accessible racking training for countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I set up my own shipbuilding foundation 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have offered free or affordable opportunities for more than 15 000 urban youths (mostly black and Latin American), some of whom have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities to my hometown of Detroit, so that we can offer high-quality rack strength to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic race.
The strength of the rack increases strength, strength and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings life-long benefits and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has aroused thousands of young girls who now want to start the racking, and it is absolutely awesome.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you for Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison's true "girl power", which you showed when you won the Olympic gold, and for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way for a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and are preparing for a new strike.
Ministers hoped to decide on the changes to the remuneration and working conditions of the dispute by accepting a renewed agreement with the BMA (British Medical Association), but 58% of the 37 000 junior doctors who voted against the proposal.
In July, Health Minister Hunt told of the plans to bring the agreement into force and said that the British Public Health System (NHS) was "no one's country" and that any additional delays would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement that will include changes to the practices of night and weekend work in order to improve health care in non-social times.
Last night, Ellen McCourt, chairman of BMA's junior doctor committee, issued a statement saying: "Junior doctors are still very cautious about the proposed agreement, and the fear is that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new agreement, so we need to move forward, because time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by talking, but the government has been reluctant and sometimes not even reacting in any way.
Even though Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, reverse the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready for new work-fighting measures."
At the end of April, the previous strike delayed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consultants were asked to support the strike watch.
Ministers hoped to conclude the dispute on the changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the staff of the trade union representing doctors in Britain.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54 000 junior doctors covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS employees, appealed to junior doctors not to take up new strikes.
Mortimer says: "Employment measures achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already operating at the extreme borders and cause concern, distress and disturbances for patients, medical staff and their families.
For the last two months, we have been negotiating with the Committee on Junior Medicine and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisors and the detection of irregularities.
Workers were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other important issues – such as development, flexibility in education, further training for those returning from work, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in the care sector – was a sign of the seriousness of the agreements concluded with BMA in November, February and May – between workers, health education England responsible for health education and the Ministry of Health."
A medicine that pays about €2.40 per day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are getting around €2.40 per day when the authorities recommended that it be given to more people and longer-term use.
Anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
The NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), which is part of the UK Public Health System (NHS), has instructed that ticagrelor should be administered to patients for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) which is part of the British Public Health System (NHS) and assesses the introduction of new treatments has instructed that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Approximately 140 000 people have a heart attack each year in England, one quarter of which is recurrent or stroked.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is the fat in the walls of the blood vessels, which produces plaques.
If the plaque breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if a blood clot is released, it can pass through the bloodstream and prevent blood from flowing into the brain, resulting in stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is higher in people who have had a heart attack.
A ticagrelor produced by AstraZeneca in Britain, sold under the product name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of stoppers.
The NICE guidelines published today recommend that ticagrelor be administered for the next 90 mg for 12 months, then reduced to 60 milligrams and additional aspirin twice daily for a further three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the Centre for the Implementation of Treatment Methods (NICE) says: "Even though effective treatments to prevent disease progression and symptoms are available, up to a quarter of those who have had a heart attack will have a new seizure or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of renewal can have a very negative impact on human quality of life.
We have been shown that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Due to limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular as regards the risk of bleeding, when used for more than three years, the use of the treatment method is not recommended for any longer period of time.
Due to the climate of political correctness, the electoral fraud in Muslim regions flourished
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was expelled from his mission last year because of corruption, which led to a report by the government.
The climate of political correctness led to the closing of eyes from widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, reveals today's government report.
The former government minister, Sir Eric Pickles, strongly criticises the police, electoral observers and city councils for closing their eyes on the electoral fraud 'due to hypersensitivity to ethnic and religion'.
According to Mr Pickles, the former Minister of Regional Government and the current power figure against corruption, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form guard chains outside the polling stations in order to protect the frightened voters.
He proposes that voters present an identity card in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, only the voter must give his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that fingers be baptized after voting in an indelible ink, so that no one can vote twice.
We need to protect more whistle-blowers, says Sir Eric.
He called on journalists to improve access to government documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and the culture that favours them more widely in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the vote on the Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ordered that then Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be separated from his role due to corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The Court held that Rahman "deviledly" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamism.
Rahman was said to be "the basis of his campaign to use as a basis for the religious obligation of every religious Muslim to vote for him".
Up to 300 votes were questionable or misguided in a way that the person voted by pretending to be another person.
According to Sir Eric, evidence of fraud was received throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern at the post-election fraud in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were told that they were pressured to vote on the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made a number of proposals to clean up the voting system, including the requirement for an identity card at the polling station.
The report says: "There has been evidence that some vulnerable ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members, particularly in Pakistan and Bangladesh-based communities."
"We were concerned... that the state institutions had closed their eyes to this kind of activity because of the most "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on the handling of postal voting tickets from political activists, in order to prevent 'harvesting of votes'.
The report currently under review by Theresa May also calls for stricter checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the voting rights register for immigration and preferential fraud.
Consider options requiring voters to present an identity card before voting.
The watering of fingers after voting in an indelible black, so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a limit of three years for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibiting political activists to process filled-in voice and postal envelopes.
Police have the right to form guard chains around polling stations.
The amendment of the law so as to make it easier to raise the intimidation charges under the 1983 Representation of the People Act on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Only to allow English at polling stations (except Wales).
Improving training in order to ensure that staff are supervised by the rule that only one person can enter the voting booth at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the London Police Department and considers it "astounding" that, after the Tower Hamlet case, no criminal charges were brought.
"The electoral court separated Lutfur Rahman and his representative from his mandate because of corruption and numerous illegal practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without reasonable doubt and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on a number of grounds."
He also criticised the ineffective "transparency checks" of the districts responsible for the election lists of the City Council.
"The judgment of the court last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all Parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and covert malpractice of some people and its denial."
The similarity of the Olympic biker with the Duchess Catherine and the other twins at the Rio Olympics.
This week, the Rio 2016 Olympics were wildened by the French cyclists Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose similarity with the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to the discussions on social media, this 24-year-old Olympic Member is certainly not the only athlete fighting for the championship who has a similarity with a known person.
In honor of Rio's Games and all the well-known faces on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all the Olympic representatives whose similarity with Hollywood celebrities is evident.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison (left) of U.S. men's archery team has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the duchess Catherine doubled on the bicycle tracks, many people have quoted in social media how one of the archer's favorite actors is Leonardo DiCaprio's twin brother.
Brady Ellison, the U.S. men’s archery team, caused a storm after the pictures published on Twitter, in which he alarmingly resembles the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the social media injury and admitted that he had heard a reminder of DiCaprio since he was a child.
"I don't see the similarity so big, maybe except for beards and mustaches," said Brady Huffington to the Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
In 2012 the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were shocked by the similarity, which is undoubtedly even more highlighted in these games.
Alya Mustafina, a great-aged Russian gymnast, has been called the double being of Gloria Estefan, a Cuban-American singer.
In contrast, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghi has been comparing Glee TV series with Matthew Morrison for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is the "atletetic version" of the Inception movie actor.
Similarly, for a long time, the similarity between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett has been quoted, highlighted by both powerful brows and lips.
The silver medalist of the swimming pool, Yulia Efimova of Russia, resembles actress Annalynne McCord, and not just because of her beautifully browned skin and pale hair, whereas the United States team Nathan Adrian is, according to his fans, a "atlectic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
These two iron women, Hope Solo (left) and Jennifer Carpenter (right) in Dexter series, resemble each other in their faces.
Not only: this Twitter user was pleased to see the similarity.
This user wonders if there is a good reason for a couple's similarity.
A tweeter recently expressed his joy when "other people on the Internet agree with the similarity between Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter".
The American football star and Dexter series actor truly resemble each other with their face shapes and eyes.
Many have also found similarities in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney and the victory of gold amplifier Gabby Douglas and Anna come back!
The Olympic Commander of the CBC apologizes for saying "dead as a pig" to a Chinese swimmer.
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth position in women's 4 x 200 metres free swimming message stunned CBC's direct Olympic record viewers on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has had to apologize since one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost smell" and "dead as a pig" during the race.
Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started shooting his own opinions at the end of the women’s 4x200 - meter release message final.
MacDonaldi, who was taken into CBC's reporting team to bring color, was heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he left fast, and he died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14 swims the message at 1:57.79 and remains 1.61 seconds from the Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadians to swim into China.
The viewers around Canada react quickly after shocking the commentator’s tone and language.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was on the air yet."
The Chinese sleeper Ai Yanhan, sleeping in the final of the women's 4 x 200 metres free swimming message, was described in the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with the raging comments of Byron MacDonald, and many called for his resignation.
They didn't hold their words when they heard how indifferent Byron Macdonald was.
Tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC mission, quickly regretted the speeches made by MacDonald: "We apologize for the comment made on swimming performance.
We had to complain about the choice of words, and we regret that this happened."
In the end, CBC felt sorry for more than 90 times for people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Scott Russell, commentator, had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and added its regret to the comment of more than 90 other tweeters who complained about MacDonald’s speech.
The TV company also quickly submitted a public apology.
"We are truly sorry for these statements and for getting them on the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers in last night's broadcast, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the record, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words had to be regretted, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his regret on the transmission and tried to defend his speech by saying that he did not mean it to be personal.
"I would like to apologize for my comment that I made last night after the women's swim," said MacDonald in the Olympics broadcast at the CBC.
"I referred to the swimmer's performance, not the person.
It goes without saying that I didn't mean anything by my words, and I'm very sorry."
In Primark, the woman who made up the shop was shocking the customers.
Customers didn't know where to look when a woman took off in the middle of Primark to fit her underwear.
He further aggravated the situation by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, taking them off his feet, and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and finally tried four underpants at a store in Folkeston, Bouverie Place.
The Primark chain store at Folkestonen Bouverie Place, where she tried her underwear in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children who were in the store at the same time, tells us that after testing the underwear, an unknown woman dressed up and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He says about what happened: "People didn't believe their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own trims and underwear, and put them on.
He did not try to do it unnoticed, but he did it with complete shame.
Everyone was staring when he took his tested underwear off and apparently didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it again three times before he finally decided that he didn’t like anything, dressed up, and walked out.
He did not seem to care for the looks – nor did he think of the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had."
Davidson, a 33-year-old living in Kent City, goes on to say, "How disgusting to think that someone is taking their underwear home that someone else has been wearing and has not been washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
"I have understood that the shop staff tried to remove these pieces of clothing from the sale after the woman had left – which is correct.
It would be terrible to take new underwear home and find that someone else has done them without having been washed after that," adds Davidson.
The publicist of Primark commented: "Primark is aware of the situation in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday 9 August.
All the products in question have been withdrawn from sale."
This is how you defend yourself against armed assault with the help of Krav Maga.
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the grand master of the Krav Maga Union in New York, Rhon Mizarach, and asked for advice on how to cope with a nearby raider or an assailant.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker according to whether the attacker approaches you or against you.
If the attacker approaches from behind, first you have to turn around to see the attacker and get off the firing line, says Mizrach.
Then grab the gun so it stays between your elbow and shoulder, and hit the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the assailant on the knee, and when he goes out of pain a double, slap him in the face with a gun and back off by holding the gun against him.
The technique is similar if the armed attacker approaches the front. You must move away from the firing line, grab the weapon and rotate it so that the attacker can't fire.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and strike the attacker with a fist in the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker’s grip, back off and keep the weapon focused on the attacker.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video of how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get rid of a robber is to give up your cash – unless you're the headmaster of Krav Maga.
World Traveller Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe
The British traveler put his resistance and the echo reflex on a hard test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk’s host and tour guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his resistance by licking the euro banknote, handrail Piccadilly Circus, the train’s toilet wash button and the Russian public phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a luminometer to see for himself and to show the viewers where his tongue was pushing.
A documentary film of the experiment was taken after Ian Wright — Internal Power, and its results were surprising.
The idea of licking the toilet washer on the train can be disgusting, but the fact is that more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On its way across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals to strengthen good intestinal bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but a bad - tasted mouth.
Ian Wright first became known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
Without a doubt, licking the handrails of railway stations and the toilet sink challenged Wright’s resistance.
Wright says in the document, "I've been pretty careless since I was a kid about my health and put all kinds of things in my mouth, like soil, worms and gravel."
In the film, he really showed himself to be like his reputation.
The border came only in a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured over 4,000 units of the sample.
For the sake of comparison, the number of newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The limit was met in a common Russian toilet where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4,000 units — in newly washed hands the same number is less than 60.
Wright adventures together with Valio in a documentary film produced by Ian Wright – On the trail of inner strength, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document, "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any toilet.
Four thousand units, nothing's dirtier than that!
This place is so disgusting, I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced a documentary Ian Wright – In cooperation with Valio.
In Vali, Wright received Valio Gefilus, containing lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the good intestinal bacterial strain and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Head of the Valio snack, juice and novelty category, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to see and at the same time tells of the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time trying to figure out something crazy, and finally we came up with the idea of asking Ia to go with us."
The health of the intestine has become a global trend.
"We wanted to bring them into a wider context instead of just talking about products and tell them about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
The health of the intestine has become a global trend, and the document allows us to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells us our sense of humor!"
The film directed by Tom Hakala adds: "Let's say that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as a disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the movie.
Of course, licking some items was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows on the tape."
In a survey carried out by Valo in 2015, 84% of respondents added lactic acid bacteria to the well-being of the abdomen and intestines in particular and 58% said they had used at least occasionally products with added lactic acid bacteria.
Before he was deported, the family of the Infantry destroyed a city-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall.
The family left 50,000 pounds of damage to a city-owned rental house after they had been evicted for the terroristisation of the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their apartment in Saltash, Cornwall, following numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forced out of the apartment, the representatives of the rental dwelling company were shocked to find that the dwelling was in good condition for repair.
The walls were filled with bulging holes, the floors were torn open, the trash had been spread to the floors, and the walls had been brushed with graffiti.
The couple have now moved, and they are believed to live in a private dwelling.
Donna McEvoy, Head of Cornwall Housing, says that she is afraid that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says, "This has been a nightmare for people living here, no one should have to put up with this.
There is much to be weighed about, as the property is likely to become known not as a pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous, as is its name."
The couple had three boys who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, family terror included street fightings with baseball bats, intimidation of local residents, drug use and transmission, and loud screaming, arguing and cursing.
In June Skeldon, 47 years old, who signed the lease, received a non-social code of conduct.
Old waste was found in several rooms of the house under the threat of dismantling.
The house had been sold drugs before, and the floorers had been torn off.
The neighbors said the family fought on the street and the police had to call regularly.
This week, the Cornwall Housing Agency, by means of coercive means, removed the couple after giving them an additional 11 weeks to move away voluntarily.
Easier neighbors were grateful for the eviction — they said their life was an earthly hell.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living next door to them for 20 years, and all that time has been hard.
The police have been here incredibly many times."
"This morning, we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they've finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, Head of the Cornwall Housing Agency, reports that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which time the police were regularly called.
The trash and old toys had been thrown into the wild wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his own behaviour and the behaviour of his family, for eviction is always the last measure that Cornwall's agency is considering.
This case was very difficult, for behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking for the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, the Devon and Cornwall police and members of the community who took part in the work and bravely offered to provide us with information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of our neighbours and will send out a message that non-social behaviour is not acceptable."
Fitzpatrick says that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but they were already twenty years old.

House workers now need to clean away the waste piles surrounding the house.
In 2014, the police raided the apartment and found more than 70 grams of cannabis and other equipment, as well as £17,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when he was found guilty of possession of Class B drugs with a view to selling it.
He claimed the money was for his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been heard to move into a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were buried with graffiti.
The police say they're demanding an eviction to tenants who break the rules of leases.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police state that this eviction is a clear warning to tenants who constantly violate the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave how they want without charges, as well as for those who suffer from such behaviour," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and non-social behaviour, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flyed, beach-popped army jet scared tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force, P-3C Orion, crashed into an alarmingly low plane.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were struck by panic when a low - flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army plane comes almost to the touchliness of tourists taking the sun off the sandy beach in Aveiro, Northern Portugal.
The holidayers rose to their feet when they were consciously concerned about the sound of jet engines, which began to be heard before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the pictures of a dramatic byflight and the videos of holidayers released in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says: "It passed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash into the ground."
"I was surfing, and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the shore of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew in an alarmingly low plane.
Today, the Portuguese Air Force announced that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels and therefore had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal, because smoke from nearby forest fires affected visibility, but according to the Air Force, it did not threaten the safety of anyone.
Forest fires have caused damage in parts of continental Portugal and have killed four people on Madeira Island.
Today, the Portuguese Air Force announced that due to the bad visibility caused by the fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight in which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Excite the result of the first half of the year better than expected
In January-June, the South Karelia Social and Health District (Eksote) produced a better result than planned.
The outturn was EUR 4.3 million in surplus during the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where preventive services have been developed to help de-establish institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, the Exote aims to shorten the sequences of measures.
The extremism covers the deficit previously created by the surplus.
The remaining part may be used to shorten queues and to buy measures for patients.
The result of the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Government will discuss the six-monthly review at its meeting next Wednesday.
Seventy Special Borders Jägers swore a military whale in Immola
Of the 70 guards at the border and maritime security schools, they swore a military oath on Friday.
A military election was held in Immola on Friday.
The Tenth Special Border Jäger Course whale was held in the army’s sports field.
The military oath was sworn by 70 backup men.
Special border guards are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special border iceberger.
Two hundred and fifty of them were invited to the selection tests.
Special border icers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans from the border forces during the war were involved in the assembly of the veterans.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans took part in the event were born in 1918.
A lot of looters ahead of us - criminal intelligence helps solve crime and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 police departments in Finland has been an RTA unit for criminal intelligence and analysis.
The operation of the unit is invisible outwards.
In Häme police station, the unit consists of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's drawn by a sergeant stationed in Lahti.
The Chief Chief of Staff is Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and need, see Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various reports to the other police.
Among other things, it has obtained information from asylum seekers.
Recent work practices reform
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police working practices.
The aim was to prevent crime, which means that the police would not go to the mouths until they received the alarm.
The information collected and analysed by the Unit is used to target daily police activities where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre was set up in the country, with less than three national units and a criminal intelligence unit for each police department.
The PTR centre in Vantaa, in connection with the Central Criminal Police, is responsible for the activities at national level.
In PTR units, people from the police, Customs and Border Guard.
RTAs, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police institutions and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond its territory
Where a single police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to the RTA unit to know what is going on throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the borders of its own institution, because crime does.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit will use registers, the alert mission database and observations to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialisation, and it is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it's honest or criminal.
Based on the method of action, the author is formed by a certain kind of image.
The selection can be done on the basis of an act or person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
RTA unit workers do not carry the collars up in the city, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by criminals, as well as their own, are not reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities, thereby preventing police crime prevention attempts.
The police report on the methods publicly if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
For example, such a case was reported from the early summer, the method of marking vacant dwellings used in housebreaks.
That's where the authors put the external door stick, the middle needle, or the tape piece that they used to try to make sure the residents were really travelling.
The preliminary investigation material shall be public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals are learning from their mistakes.
The smartest people are ordering the district court protocol, which, for example, shows that fingerprints have been found.
Next time, we're going to steal gloves.
Deputy Police Commissioner Tero Seppus from Hämee Police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola from Eastern Finland Police, Detective Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Inspector Arto Tuomela from Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyse information to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in labour and financial resources.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended by the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of the institution and Finland.
A London schoolgirl who joined fathers was killed in Syria
News reports that one of the three British school students who joined Isis last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Attorney Tasname Akunjee tells the girl's family that Sultana died in Syria, Raqqqa a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in the Russian air strike at Raqqa, an Isis base in Syria, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she was planning to escape from the country of war and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and will, so that people will understand that this is a real risk when they go into the war zone - and that people will give up their decision to leave," says Akunyee.
Sultana boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 along with two other Eastern London schoolgirls and continued to travel by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an Isis fighter in Syria and remained widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he is elected.
Mr Reid, the democratic leader of the Senate, says that he is convinced that Mr Hillary Clinton, the presidential candidate for democracy, will appoint Mr Garland as the Supreme Court Judge if he is elected President.
The Senate's Republican representatives have refused to confirm Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to the Senate's majority leader, Mitch McConnell, the next president will elect the person to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court judge, Anton Scalia.
At the telephone conference on Thursday, Reid said that he would predict Clinton's choice of Garland's "unfortunately certain".
Reid’s informant later specified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly with Clinton as to whether or not he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to swing the boat by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in Columbia County.
Reid says that the Republicans who are blocking Garland's appointment are presidential candidate Donald Trump's "commanders" and "deputies".
He says Trump doesn't fit in.
According to Treats magazine, naked calendars are as good for women as for men.
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere and launches a calendar made in the style of the 1970s and inspired by Pirrell for the year 2017.
They want to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Mus calendar instead of their secret secret models.
Steve Shaw, CEO of Treats earlier this year, told me that his nudity paper differs from the old school Playboy magazine: "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this for women."
Apparently, he thinks the same about the calendar.
"We must bring back the timeless and classic nudity, where women, even men, can enjoy and be inspired by these pictures of the female body, without bother," says Shaw's calendar press release.
"Women certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art."
To be a model for the calendar, you can send your photos online or participate in open selections in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl charm: Who buys records?
Solo, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write a comment on your hateful objection with your initials No.AllUniqueMen of Middle Ages, this statement is based on real research data.
According to youGov, the new arrival of much-spoken vinyl plates is not a millennial generation boom, when the millennials want to feel the physical object in their hands, but instead the middle age nostalgic.
The age of the person who recently bought the vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, age groups 18-24 are the least likely buyers.
It is also not just the desire of amateurs to absorb discs, but the meaning is emotional: older customers of vinyl discs are slightly more likely to hide their feelings (56% v. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% v. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a television newscast, the camera would follow me walking along a lively Soho Street, wearing a non-pretentious gray suit. I'd look forward to bending my hand into a cup and say something about tradition, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and rosy while the hotels, the Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains, have taken over the premises of private entrepreneurs, there are still a handful of specialty stores left.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for a moment when I am applying very close to the men visiting these shops and trying to assess their age and nature.
Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (at that time two young women, three middle-aged men) at Reckless Records (at that time eight middle-aged men, one probably twenty-year-old woman) are on a meeting trip to London for the afternoon and spends their extra time getting acquainted with the supply of the shops.
I'm gonna ask him if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3,000-4,000 records."
These records fill his living room walls as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me the picture by email, I did not follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired so many albums and singles is partly in his available incomes. He now has the ability to buy records he could not afford when they originally appeared, and to buy again things he had to sell when he was young and broke.
"I did a lot of things in the late '60s and the early '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to have them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl plates are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their company, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
It's a bad thing."
Wez, 25 working at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new human stream that has been affected by the media hypnosis. These people have heard about the coming of vinyl plates again and are now forced to buy back their old albums.
"According to my discussions, people had generally abandoned their collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This may explain the boom of certain-aged vinyl-responsibles.
What, then, about the supposed emotional meaning of the recordings?
In just a few seconds, you will realize in a movement such as Phonica that they provide a comforting community for the same - spirited types.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been particularly upset with the unexplored payment system.
The digital world may be baffled by some vinyl fans, for whom returning to familiar disk cases means permanence and reminds us of the happy days of youth.
"I think it sometimes fills some hole or material possessions for some kind of comfort," says Wez.
"I saw it myself as a collector, and I believe that so do many others.
It's an easy way to get the ideas elsewhere."
"We're like social workers!" confounded Wez's co-worker behind a pile of records.
A April ICM opinion poll revealed that almost 50% of those who bought the vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
The opinion poll also reported that 41 percent have a disc player that they never use, and 7 percent of the customers of the vinyl disc have no disc player at all.
At this point, I'd probably look like a serious face while I'm looking at a stack of bossa nova collections.
The new arrival of vinyl plates is also accompanied by the "potash phenomenon" that Jonny, the salesman of the Sounds of the Universe (at the time three middle-aged men) has discovered.
"A client recently came into circulation and said he didn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a radiohead so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
"The proportion of such customers is not high, but they do.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our clients say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly teenagers, who are just starting a hobby."
The customer base is considerably more varied in Fop, where I will arrive next. The store has dedicated a whole layer to the vinyl plates.
Customers include 70-year-old couples, photographers, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers is delighted, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the previous moves: the latest synthesizer pop of Wild Beasts instead of the rocking jazz.
None of the clients seem very lonely, but it is difficult to identify a fading psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes and watching various discounts.
He's more of a watcher than a shopper.
He says that his income is low, so it's not possible for him to collect the records.
"They cost a lot.
The music is easy to listen to from a computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the wine is ...", he lets go of the enchanted sigh and continues:
"I can't explain. They're so unique."
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I can see a bunch of teenage girls who think they're jumping jeans, but instead they're gathering around Polaroid cameras for a while. I see a father and daughter who's thinking about buying a crossley player.
On the left is a stairwell filled with Adele's, Jeff Buckley's, Amy Winehouse's and Fleetwood's Mac's records: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the main plates for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, maybe because they're just interior elements and parts so high that they can't even reach them.
They're pure art vinyl.
However, given that all means of getting attention to these records may mean more money in the field and sending some customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little reason to complain.
It is not surprising that the population, which is most likely to have more time and money than most people, is also the group that spends most money on luxury, such as vinyl plates.
Although my research has shown that youGov's results are true, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record shops and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or working life.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings playing at Berwick Street's record stores, browsing records and avoiding a 30-year-old who's playing a TV drunk, staring scaryly and looking at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker is the longest living vertebrate – video report
Scientists say that the longest vertebrate living on Earth is a shark.
According to the pharmacologist Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was aged 272 to 512 years, a female of five metres in length.
The French court rejected the application for the winding-up of the jungle camp’s stores
The French court has rejected the Calais authorities' application for the dismantling of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle camps of thousands of refugees.
At the hearing this week, the Calais authorities made claims that the State should be allowed to break down 72 temporary shops established for refugee camps, which sell different goods from tobacco to energy drinks and offer haircuts to the residents of the refugee camp, which can be bought in temporary restaurants for 50 cents or for a few euros.
According to Calais's prefective authorities, these shops and restaurants must be abolished because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the grey economy and because they involve fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential for the camp, as free meals provided by the state-sponsored organization and other bodies are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often provide protection and free food for those who need it.
The Court ruled that there was no legal basis for the deportation of 72 temporary traders, but considered the concerns of the Calais Prefect to be "fully understandable".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the camp’s grocery stores, cafes and restaurants are much more important than just providing food to people who “live in extremely unstable conditions”.
He says that they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet.
One of the places under the threat of dismantling was the Jungle Book Kids, which is unprofitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice to hundreds of unaccompanied minors who are most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed an address requiring the children’s cafe to be kept.
According to a letter sent to the Guardian, its closure would be "a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old".
Two charities, Help Refuges and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after the sharp increase in the number of arrivals in the summer, the number of people in the jungle camp has risen to a record of over 9 000.
Food prices in Finland fall clearly faster than in the EU average
Food is greatly cheaper in Finland to the satisfaction of consumers and to the detriment of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by almost five per cent in three years, compared to 0.9 per cent on average in EU countries.
At the same time, food has become 1% more expensive in Germany and Sweden.
Over the past three years, food prices have fallen most in Finland from the EU countries with the same level of pay as in Finland.
In Britain alone, food prices have fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are reflected in the article by Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen, published in Tieto & Trends blog.
The magazine compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest data will be from June this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then followed a turn, after which food has become cheaper a year.
The price is now under the bans on food imports imposed by Russia, which have eliminated the export of food from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” says Lehtinen.
Increased price competition between industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in price.
The large trade chains S-Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
Price competition has appeared to the consumer as prominent advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not the place for affordable food, although the price of food has fallen greatly.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with a level of wages similar to that in Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the comparative countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food from similar countries would be sold in Finland.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the comparative countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to get to the old EU countries at food prices, we need to split VAT to the average level of the EU countries and continue to compete in prices", Lehtinen writes.
The Lehtinen notes that the calculations he has made at the rate of VAT are indicative.
School isn't quite the same anymore.
The person returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be put in place at the beginning of the semester in all lower schools.
It is a guide that works in all schools in Finland.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells about the official objectives.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ in many ways from the old ones.
Among other things, the study of fiction is abandoned, and schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education starts in sixth grade at the latest, and social education starts in fourth grade.
The greatest change, however, concerns the role of students.
Before it was thought that the teacher was teaching the students, but now everyone must be active and learn from each other.
This is how you try to make school more interesting.
The tallest vertebrae in the world was found. The polar shark could live for up to 400 years.
The Greenland halibut (Somniosus microcephalus) known as the icy is only 150 years old.
It can live after 250 years, reports a new study.
The figures make the species the longest vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal, it is only passed by an Icelandic imposter whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507.
Greenland's sharks are swimming down the North Atlantic.
They also hold a second record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to five feet [5 m].
Since growth rate is slow, the consequences are that only about a centimetre a year, adults have lived hard for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen, along with his colleagues, found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks of 28 females who had remained in the fishermen’s fishing gear.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon dating of the eye lenses.
The mean age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 cm and 502 cm, were exposed to approximately 335 and 392 years of age.
Since previous studies have shown that ice sharks only reach sexual maturity in more than four metres, researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published by Science.
Stockman's fired almost 300 people - no fewer sellers.
Almost 300 workers are dismissed from Stockmann.
Cooperative companies in a firm in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the match, about 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will take the form of layoffs," says Stockmann in his release.
According to it, the number of sellers in the goods sector will not be reduced so that the customer service does not suffer.
In addition, around 80 workers in support activities are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann's yt-negotiations concerned some 3,000 workers.
At the beginning of these, it was estimated that there would be around 380 employees.
A reduction of around EUR 20 million per year is intended to achieve cost savings in the course of next year.
In the past, Stockmann has launched an efficiency programme designed to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
In the background are Stockmann’s difficulties in making the goods store profitable.
Although the adjusted operating result of the group improved to EUR 11,1 million in the second quarter, the trade in goods still makes a loss.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, Stockmann’s see CEO, sales in the department of goods have not reached the objectives set by the company.
"Unfortunately, staff reductions are necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail has a positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen states in the release.
The result improvement in the second quarter was particularly due to the good success of the chain of clothing Lindex.
Ketju achieved the best sales and results in the second quarter of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s operating result was 4.1 million in losses.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year are shrinking from last year.
The corrected operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees throughout the country
The centre of low pressure on the north of Finland will keep the weather rain on Friday, says Ilona Lag, the meteorologist of HS.
There will also be rainfalls in the middle of the country, but to the south there will be vertebrates.
The temperature is no longer very summer, for the whole country has less than 20 degrees of mercury.
In the northern rainy areas, it will be 10-15 degrees.
Kenya’s sports team is shaken by a strange explanation of the doping scandal - coach’s tempo
The Kenyan sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah was a national team athlete in the doping test.
The news agency AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is a 800 - meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya’s national team, reported that Anzrah’s identity was revealed after he gave a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials came to inform the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home, for he "has committed a crime against Kenya's country team".
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the papers.
We cannot accept such use," Kip Keino, president of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, in turn, grumbled the news agency Reuters.
The Olympics' sport starts on Friday, and Rotich is due to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was ranked fourth in the World Cup last year and has premiered Rio’s winning favorites.
According to Reuters, the source inside the Kenyan sports team claimed that Anzrah was using the sportsman's accreditation card to get free meals in the village.
When the antidoping officers met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid he'd be exposed," the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio's general sport studio is evaporating its emptyness.
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching sports.
In Rio, on Friday, the battle for sports medals began, but the world’s top individuals were able to present their skills to a confusingly empty scene.
Rio’s organizers reported on Friday that only 58 percent of the first day’s morning tickets and 65 percent of the evening’s tickets have been sold.
It was four years ago in London, where the stadium bullied the cheering crowd.
The finale tickets are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympics have lost sight even before sport in general.
For example, thousands of empty seats have been seen in the sights of rugby, melon, and riding.
When Brazil’s medalist brains Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the scene was full.
After the Brazilian twin, the Netherlands played against Russia, and 12,000 people were only filled with about 30 percent of the scenery.
The bad move is at least explained by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic races are strange to Brazilians who are accustomed to football.
True, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not have filled the football stadium.
The publicist Mario Andrada reported this weekend that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There is still 1.1 million left to sell," said Andrada, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million flags of the London Olympics, 8.2 million was sold, although the tickets cost almost half as much as Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around EUR 9 to over EUR 1 000.
More than half of the tickets cost less than EUR 16.
At the Summer Olympics in London, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but this is not yet permitted in Rio because the organisers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
True, in Rio, organisers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for less well - known species, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty places at the Rio Stadium this morning.
Even on the sands of Copacabana, there has been no interest in the public.

I've had enough of the people in the gallery.
New way to protect nature - get a right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
The foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant natural sites.
After that, private, companies and entities can redeem the rights of holders of land with money.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is divided virtually into parcels that those willing to acquire against the payment of the right of the holder.
The holder is entitled to veto in its 187 square blocks, which in practice means that no approval by each holder is required if the use of the land is to be changed.
You can also acquire custody rights for several blocks.
Acquisition of a right of administration is something concrete that can be left for inheritance or given as a gift.
You don't have to go carrying banners or chain yourself up to protect nature," Juha Levíkana, who acquired the right to control the company, justifies.
The holder of the administrative right receives accurate location information from his block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation's website, the names of the holders of the rights are available on the same map as the block data of the land.
The only risk that the work of the Foundation will change from its original idea is that of the levakava.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest with the aim of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would somehow operate in an ethical or commercial manner, but it should not be possible.
The core idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Holder project is the protection of natural areas so that they can be intact and in peace.
The Foundation will acquire land either by buying or by making a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of rights of holders, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also targets outside the Finnish borders and plans to land in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in pop-up forest at Helsinki Market Square from 13 to 19 August.
Wheel thieves are the worst torturing Turku in large cities - see the situation of your municipality
Cycling thieves torture Turku the worst of Finland’s major cities.
This year, more wheels have been stolen in proportion to the population than in the nine other major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat explained to the police how much bicycles and parts of bicycles have been stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August of this year, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, there were four to five bike thieves per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, only about two bicycle thieves per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities, double the number of thefts are carried out in proportion to the number of inhabitants," describes Police Inspector Tommi Reen.
Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of threats can be influenced by how much the city is moving on wheels and how many wheels there are at all," says Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen, the Police Department, will have to expect Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts goes largely according to the number of study and cycling cities.
Turku has a tight center, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
For example, Espoo is a different type of city, where city centres are far apart and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of movement," Reen says.
In all Finland, the police have become aware of slightly less wheel thefts in January to August than in the corresponding period of last year.
Still, there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, police are reporting a little more than 20,000 bicycle thefts every year.
It means 50-60 fillers every day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 bikes per year.
"They're big," Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more wheels, for only some victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to file a report on a bike theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police will be resolved.
Typically solved bike theft is where the police get information about the theft right away and the thief gets caught in blood.
“Even in other investigations, cases can be discovered when, for example, in a drug case, a stolen wheel can be found in the apartment,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, cyclists are caught weekly in a work or police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, wheels are stolen, for example, from the shopping center’s wheel racks, courtyards, warehouses, and bicycle cellars, i.e. practically everywhere they are stored.
As in previous years, Jopo is the biggest thief of individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the wheel better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take a bike, for example, for short - term use, but a large part of the stolen wheels end up for sale, for example, via the Internet.
They stay on the domestic market.
"At least the police didn't find out that stolen wheels would go abroad much," Reen says.
According to the police, shoppers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
I'm sure some of them will buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some might have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful, as he or she may be guilty of a cover-up or violation.
"The alarm bells should ring if a good-quality bike is sold at a clear lower price," Reen says.
Severi, a special librarian, carries his colorful Nops to protect Kallio's library in Helsinki for his working day.
He's had five bikes, but no one's been stolen, says the deer. "Never been taken, there's been a good monk."
"This may not be so attractive to thieves, but this may not even have a hipster value," says the H.E.
Siuni Valve, who was a quick customer of the kiosk in Kallio in Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now, the bike is down against the wall, but usually Valve locks his bike in a solid, such as a wheel rack.
"It's going to be a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I've ever owned," says the Helsinki student on his white bike, whose body alone cost about five hundred euros.
"The whole time you've heard guys say you've taken the wheels."
"Mostly bad wheels, such scum jocks."
The bike was stolen from the building company's inner yard a year ago.
But the bike had not been locked, so the Watch had been waiting to catch it.
You're under 15 years of age responsible for your crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-reviewing teams from the United States
In Helsinki, the so - called peer pressure is being tried to prevent young people from getting involved in crime.
At first, the experiment applies to persons under 15 years of age who are now deprived of criminal liability.
The peer board is involved in the first young man's crime.
The idea is that the peer review team will discuss what happened with the offender and impose sanctions.
A week later, the offender himself can join the peer board to make up for his actions.
For example, a letter to the family explaining what has become done and what has been learned from it can have other consequences.
Tommi Laatio, Director of Youth, tells us that the model is not tight.
We also have other forms of mediation that are used in parallel.
"All are guided in a more responsible direction so that everything does not get ruined by the first mistake," says the Department.
A model of the United States has been taken into account in the peer review team, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, a young person does not have to face an adult panel, but reflects what happened to approximately the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service designer Iikka Lovio of Palmu, who followed the trial, reports that it was an abuse that was successfully resolved.
In particular, the first crimes committed by persons under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It has been a message to continue in the way you choose," says Lovio.
The peer-review team is part of the Helsinki project of Finnish immigrants, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new approaches are being offered to all those in need, not just to young immigrants.
Over 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign.
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was published by Politico, a United States magazine that had received a draft of it.
According to the paper, an open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money transferred to the Congressional elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his lack of concern, incompetence and record disapprovals, threaten to bring a sound stream to the democracies in these elections," says Politico.
Only the immediate targeting of all possible funds to the Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in their necks with a Trump-engraved anchor.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election will fall day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons who organized the letter is apparently Andrew Weinstein, a Republican opposed to Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security stated in an open letter that they did not support Donald Trump as President.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States
In the United States, President Hillary Clinton told about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be president so that the American economy can do well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy can go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve US infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would partly be financed through increased taxes for the rich, partly through private money.
The building program is a handhold for American dunars who suffer as factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the greatest investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We are a builder nation, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday he sounded like Sanders, stressing that the rich should pay their fair share of the tax.
And if the company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the tax of departure, says Clinton.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"As President, I am opposed to any trade agreement that acts against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticise the financial programme published by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday for "only favouring millionaires of this kind".
The tax deduction proposed by Trump for corporate tax has previously been called the "Trump loophole" by Clinton.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur.
He reminded the audience of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of clothes that Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start making his own products in America," Clinton poke.
These are Rio ratings: The competitions have not glued Finns to the squares, but the mobile app is interesting
Typically, sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached extreme numbers.
At one time, 12 per cent of the population is attached to the squares: on Tuesday night swimming was followed by 615 000 viewers from Yle Olympics channel TV2 at the same time.
As a result of the comparison, almost 800 000 viewers were invited to the TV2 event at the end of the month, and quite a million other players were invited to the EM competitions.
The Olympics have so far been most interested in Sunday night biking and the fifth day of the race, both of which reached almost half a million viewers at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, Chief of Sports, is pleased with the audience figures and recalls that the audiences will be divided into several instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, Finns are following the Olympic Games in Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV audience will choose the Olympic Games in general.
On the television side, the viewers share TV2 and Yle Fem.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions Yle has dedicated an entire channel to.
When the shipment arrives 24 hours a day, and all that time, from 20,000 to 500 000, it is a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's race broadcasts will be in Finland during the night.
Another reason for the shy interest - if someone thinks it is now weak - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken one of the surprise medals from the opening games, the interest would have gone up with it.
In addition, sport is only about to begin, as are other species of interest to Finns: sailing and horse riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of viewers at the beginning has been close to what was expected.
When the sport starts, the audience will explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 Mobile app for the Games, which in the first days of the Games rose to the Apple App Store for the most free app in Finland.
By Monday, the app was loaded 150,000 times.
I'll bet we're already about 200,000 downloads.
"We don't get the numbers of the network until later," says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not acted as desired for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and that the errors have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been accompanied by a delay and other small technical problems in the early stages.
Applications have been updated to correct errors.
The Rio Olympics will be seen in the channels and arenas of Yle more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
Some species can be monitored from the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Põe broadcasts games daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the laboriest for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be watched from the Yle channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports will be shown on Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is the Sun, whose depth is 95.3 metres on the Crossback.
It may be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical training teacher, found a 20 - square - foot [20 sq m] printing press on the crossback, the bottom of which was shown by a diving computer to be 104 metres deep.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to confirm the observation by invoking.
The method may not find a small deepen in a hundred meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Over 80 meters [80 m] from Saimaa, Reisvesi and Main Lake.
They have not been studied as closely as the Sun.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be some unknown depths," Kannela wonders.
If the deepest lake is determined by the mean depth, it is the Great Lake Juka, 23 meters.
From this point of view, your Sun will not enter the ten deepest, and the Suvasvesi is still further from the top.
Correction on August 12 at 14.29: The corrected last paragraph, where the deepest lakes were wrong.
A Fascinating tax sector: The tax on pensioners continues to tighten up
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that the malpractice appeared under the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to employees.
This is not included in the Government's proposal.
We believe that it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners experienced income reductions that ease taxation.
The matter warmed up the opposition representatives in Parliament, who were acclaiming the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb from the electoral promises.
The purchasing power is secured, it's not growing.
According to the Minister of Finance, Petteri Orpo (see above), tax reductions are mainly about securing and not increasing purchasing power, as next year's wages will not be increased.
He says that tax reductions will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) and Orpo's desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached.
He says that holding to the treaty is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done by the social partners, so it must not be questioned.
It is necessary because the economy is so dependent on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
In a case of persistent unemployment
The Ihanian appeals to the government that it would take long-term unemployment in the budget line, at least to stop its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed persons was about 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of persistent unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims in the attacks in Thailand
At least four people died during the bombings last night and last night in Finland.
The embassy calls on Finnish residents to be alert and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the guidance of the authorities.
Finnish tourists who intend to go to Thailand should not cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions should be carefully followed, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The period of travel by Finnish residents to Thailand dates from the end of the year.
The vast majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook since the bombings.
The embassy has tried to reach out to the Finns in Hua Hin in particular for information on the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be well, says Westphalen.
Not known
According to Westphalen, we don't know who did this yet.
The Ambassador believes that events may relate to the political unrest of a divided society in Thailand and last week's referendum on the Constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The Act was passed by a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who declared themselves against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, there is a ethnic-national conflict involving the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, previous attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, says Westphalen.
According to him, the town celebrates Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The impact would affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai Police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also excluded, says Thai police according to AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand in 24 hours, after 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as Phuket and Hua Hin.
Even in a tourist destination popular with Finns, the holiday island Phuket exploded four bombs in the night, reports the Thai magazine Bangkok Post.
According to the current data, they did not require death victims.
Two of the bombs went off in the newspaper at Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the newspaper.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded in the popular tourist destination in Hua Hin yesterday and today.
At least one of them died in both double-bombs.
In addition, in South Thailand, at the village of Surat Than and in the city of Trang, at least one bomb exploded.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to travel to Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday islands.
No known impactor
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the Thai military junta, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We're not supposed to make people panic any more, he told the reporters.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister for Security Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the purpose of the authors was to destroy tourism in the country, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy invites Finnish residents to be alert and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to go to Thailand should not withdraw their journey because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions should be carefully followed, says Westphalen.
In wounded Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks and their victims that took place during the night of Finland.
There's been a little bit more information on last night's strike at Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
The wounded include at least Germans, Italians, Dutchs and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in the second attack by Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded in the vicinity of a bell tower known as visibility.
Thai PBS says the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin where they think they've found another bomb.
According to the Governor of the Province, Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower box.
A municipal employee died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded about half an hour apart.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The U.S. Bales won the Women's Square
Alexandra Raisman was the second point 60.098 and Alija Mustafina was the third point with 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still in the Rio Championships for ships with permson, jump and boom.
Bales has controlled women’s gymnastics to an extent for the past few years.
He had eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-game and permanto championships three times in a row as well as the boom last and the other year.
In the United States team, Bales has reached two world championships.
The Biles have a jump and a boom.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "The person has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs the real estate agency and the children’s play club in the same property in Phuket, is not concerned about the impact of the bombings in Thailand on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not believe that this will result in anything more wonderful, the Finnish entrepreneur in Asia estimates Huovila, who has worked for about 20 years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of Thailand’s many tragedy trials close to him.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then there was a bird flu and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these have not banished the tourists in the past, I don't think this is going to happen either.
The office of the Huovila company is located a few hundred meters from the location of the explosion.
Hoovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called about 9 o’clock from local time and said that it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's festival in Thailand.
Patong had a calm atmosphere, and the main street movements were allowed to open around 10:00 a.m. local time.
Many had not even heard of the attacks on the beach.
At half past three o’clock, Thailand’s time at Patong was normalized and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the strike, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila.
Later that car was seen in the Kruunupy in Jouxholmie.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol detected two men matching the distinguishing signs hiding in a nearby six.
The other guy got caught right away.
The other one ran away, but the man was later found in the woods using a cop dog.
Men are suspected of stealing a motor vehicle, theft and gross damage.
The police thank the people who tipped them off.
Research Director on Russia's leadership changes: Clear disengagement
On Friday, Russia made the highest change of leadership in the years when President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov, the leader of his regime.
Ivanov's successor is a 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's an ex- diplomat and worked as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that Ivanov’s dismissal may be due to Putin’s desire to prevent the strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building up powers independent of the President.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in a relationship with other executives or screwed up.
Drop to Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin’s inner circle, will be transferred to specific environmental and transport tasks.
With the tape put forward by the state media, Putin referred to the change as a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to another assignment and suggested that Heavy replace him, said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear drop in the position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most prominent people in the Russian Empire.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but became president of Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old map, such as the governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Katri Pynnöniemi, senior researcher at the Institute for Foreign Policy, says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s place that Putin should switch to a younger neighborhood.
Isis fighters used civilians as human shields when they retreated from Syria.
They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to the city of Jarabulus, so that we would not target them, Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council, said.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters received approximately 90% of the important city of Manbij.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists stayed in the city at that time.
The corrected earlier news at 7:30: We were wrongly told that civilians were running from the city, in fact, the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's public policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells the STT that the publication of documents cannot be based on the authority's own policies but is based on the law.
The Ministry of Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the Minister of Interior’s events to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with the guidance of the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's Communication Director tells STT that the Ministry has noted the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show begins in Rio
As in the last few years, Bolt's been running against time under the value fairs.
He hurt his way back from the early season and had to skip the Olympics in Jamaica.
This has not been perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
I've been practicing well and it's the key thing, and Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included small - dressed samba dancers and fans.
The bottom line around Poriina Bolt is that the Jamaican star has risen in an age when sport has been struggling with doping scandals and skating interest.
Bolt’s previous defeat at the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he was cut off at the beginning of 200 metres at 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that was slowed down by injuries and loose training.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a time of 100 metres, with which he crushed the world record and his competitors ’ confidence in the final event of 9.69 C.E.
It's harder than that.
One year later, in the Berlin World Cup, Bolt achieved his career at the point of law at the time.
World record in Berlin is still valid at 9.58 a.m. and at 19.19 a.m.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is pursuing a 200 - meter world record and a 19 - second understatement, but no one believes that it will be born except Bolt himself.
At Satase, the great challenger of Bolt is Justin Gatlin, the winner of the 2004 Olympics in Athens.
Last year at the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredths of a second.
During its reign in Beijing, Bolt has never lost a single time in the finals of the value fairs, if only he has made his way.
In December 2011, the 100th World Cup final was missed by Bolt because of the fraudulent departure.
Bolt will be up to 30 in a week.
He's an old man of young men, and Rio's competitions are his last Olympics.
Bolt is next year's final goal in London.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I'll have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Detections of Rio: Two athletes suspected of a doping offence
According to Xinhua, a Chinese swimmer named Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyin found traces of banned substances on the doping sample.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping offence.
In addition, the Kenyan sports coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given me a doping sample showing signs of epo hormone.
He was ranked fourth in Rio in the women's 100-metre butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estato, the Chinese swimmer has taken its doping case to the International Court of Appeal CAS.
Xinhua tells us that the sample Xinyi gave on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent a sports coach from Rio home for a doping attack.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK reported that the Kenyan coach had become an athlete in the test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, we're talking about a Chinese fast-track coach, John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the Ferguson Rotich race pass of 800 meters in the situation.
There's nothing to stop Phelps... the historical gold came into a play style.
The most successful athlete in the history of the Olympics, Michael Phelps, swims 200 metres mixed with his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach the same species’s Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive race.
Phelps' payout was 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino was placed in confusion second before China Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun. Helen Skelton, the BBC Olympic swimming commentator, laughs at the evening magazine's quick interview.
The case of Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read in the evening magazine website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton is not very stressed if there is a slight noise in the Som or British press about his revealing and special outfits.
It's a visual media, he's stressing.
Skelton is dressed in high-level shoes and a short dress that certainly has at least enough exposure to the eyes of at least a number of conservative British soys.
There are, however, no back steps.
It's important to look good, and small judges are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to upset you and perhaps startle you, but he insists that you don't want to be in the lead.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter that much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the court has reached all the way to Finland?
I can't, but everything that's paying attention to how much these swimmers are doing and how much they're making sacrifices is okay with me, Skelton's grinning.
You know what?
It's a shock from nothing if it comes from the dress of the driver.
I'm a little amused if this thing has hit someone's radar.
Rio Police made two arrests for a terrorist suspected murder.
On Thursday, the Rio police reported that they have arrested two people because of a suspected terrorist attack.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the Games.
In the same context, five other arrests were made and two people were questioned before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group as those arrested by the police in July.
The arrested are believed to have connections with the Isis Extremities Organisation.
Those arrested were known to have incited violence in social media.
Messages calling for violence had been disseminated, among other things, through their recommendations in the WhatsApp.
85,000 police are responsible for the security of the Rio Games.
The police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their match in the empty hall in the early part of the Rio basketball tournament on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package of basketball arenas and closed the place down from the audience.
The police let the public in after the controlled explosion of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that the police have carried out a controlled explosion mission.
The police closed down the arena because of the suspicious package found there.
The crowd got in after the police had controlledly blown up the package.
The audience did not record to the audience by the start of the match because the police closed the arena because of the suspicious package found in the hall.
The police didn't blow up the package until after they let the public into the hall.
The drink woke up the Spanish team that started the competition in a dreamy fashion.
Spain, which started the competition with two losses, won Nigerian points 96-87.
In the previous two races, Spain achieved silver.
For the third time during the Rio Summer Games, the police have already carried out a controlled explosion mission.
Last time, the police had to blow up a suspicious discovery near the destination of road cycling last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their match in front of empty views in the early part of the Rio basketball tournament.
The Argentine lady was poking on Petaja-Siren - a Finnish citizen was thinking of protesting
The wind in Petaja-Siren had a colorful day in Rio.
The wind in Petjajah-Sir went through a lot on Thursday.
The Argentinan lady grumbled Tuuli Petaja-Siren on Thursday, Rio, at the opening of the women's surf day.
There was a clear breach of the wind.
The opponent admitted an offence.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away, Joakim Wilenius, the head coach of Finland, told.
The athlete thought about the protest for a long time.
It was not worth it, then, because it would have been in vain under the rules of the Olympic Games.
I should have fallen into the water to get credit," said Petjaja-Siren.
The Finn hung on his board until the last, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
With the crash, the Finnishman remained in place 27.
In the overall situation, the 2012 Olympic silver medalist in London is the eighth.
In terms of the shoulders, the crash didn't affect much.
Friday is an important day for the race to go 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petaja-Siren did not make any protests.
7 special issues that scientificly prolong age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years into a person’s life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life is prolonged.
Sometimes things that a person cannot influence themselves can bring him more years.
These include a tendency to moderate body fat or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong your life.
You don't even have to come around and get the milk can.
The secret of longevity has been sought in many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A study by Harvard University found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to the "lower risk of death", particularly in relation to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, on behalf of alcohol, there are studies that show that reasonable use - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one observed that wine drinkers lived as parents as people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of dental floss can prolong a person’s life for up to six years, says one study.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
On the other hand, they can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study carried out in Norway found out how laughter had an effect on human life.
Over 54 000 people were watched by a project that lasted seven years.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to survive after the experiment.
Sex, when the protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition to everything, it can also prolong the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as it is is not enough.
In order to have more years of life, a person must also have an orgasm.
Of course, mobility will bring more years, it will not be disputed.
However, reaching a long life does not require absolute slatency.
A study at Oxford University found that women with big butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study associated these issues with lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete who got to the Olympic medallions or an actor who won Oscar, he's more likely to live longer than the usual bull.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring his life back for years.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that a long-term age is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, allows for recognitions such as the Nobel Prize to be sought.
A study on shopping behaviour in people aged over 65 found that a person shopping daily, i.e. the person likely to make shopping more frequently, found that the person shopping daily.
This is due to the fact that running in specific shops reduces loneliness.
Again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may predate death.
So counting the credit card out of your hand... online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
A drunk drunk driver went off towards a truck.
On Friday evening, there was a serious coup between a truck and a passenger car.
The accident took place in Koskella, midday at 9 p.m., between Koskenten and Sorvastontie.
The truck had been driving towards Forssa, when the arrived passenger car had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was up and running, but it was on fire.
The driver managed to turn the fire off himself.
The passenger car went out into the ditch, and then over the ditch to the roof.
The woman, born in 1972, carried a passenger car, was squeezed into her car.
The rescue unit removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The female's blow test was 2.02 prom.
He's been suspected of being a heavy drinker.
The mail sent free candy to the wrong city.
Salon K-Citymarket had deficiencies in the bulk box selection because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to the Seinäjoki River.
On Thursday, Teija Haltia, who lived in Pernio, was buying free candy at Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit the eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the bulk because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when the Post gets the load!
So if you don't get traffic in the lawn, the sign says.
The sign of the merchant’s fox is linked to the fact that the Posti extended its services last spring to cover lawn cutting.
Weed cutting is offered by Post until the end of August.
Haltia felt that the sign was mainly fun and decided to share it in social media.
I was stunned by the popularity of the update.
The media has also been calling all along, and the attention raised by this issue is incredible, and it is a wonder for Halt.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had more than 700 distributions on Facebook.
Haltia got her favorites caught in a bulk bag, even though a few of the bearings were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for the business of the Company Transport Services, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three out of the five stages were lost yesterday in the wrong place (Seinajoki), and we no longer went to Saloon with three, but only today we took five stages, and Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
It's the first word in the evening.
Teija Halt wasn't angry with the sign because she found all her favorites in the selection.
Fever weight loss! 30 kilos lighter Lotta Backlund published an image of her changes
A comedian producer has lost tens of pounds since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of life change.
Lotta shared a picture of her change in Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was in a gym and intended to be normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
A comedian, a TV producer, Lotta Backlund, started his weight loss contract as early as 2009.
He is a comprehensive change of lifestyle and has lost a little bit of weight of 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund released a picture pair of his amazing performance in Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years from her appearance.
Backlund’s pre- and post-scenario pair has collected a number of praiseworthy comments from the co-scenarios.
You're amazing, aren't you?
We're on our way, motivation is hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project Do it now.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I'm on the same trip to heaven myself, another tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos of it with the project "Let's do it now."
At that time, he told the evening magazine that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was then ten pounds [10 kg] away.
During the three-month gymnastics tour, a five-pound drop occurred.
The wish of a woman murdered in Loviisa: The memory of the victim for the benefit of the police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered instead of flowers and addresses with a donation for the benefit of the police dog.
Sipoo Veterinary Centre has published a Facebook update, which conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for the benefit of police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Station and also carried out his nursing training there.
The veterinary station remembers a woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, sense of humor and job fearless.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
Facebook updates include an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update states that the total amount of donation money goes to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman in Loviisa Koskenkyla was murdered in her own courtyard.
The woman’s neighbors have told the evening magazine that the victim was very much in love with animals.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and roost.
A 27-year-old man who was suspected of murder didn't know her, and they had no connection.
The killer was followed by a police dog, Börje, who was fatally wounded in the arrest.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court ruled against Post for a violation of the Equality Act
Post did not have the right to retain the salary of a worker who refused to become acquainted with the temporary agency worker, assessing Kanta-Häme district court in its judgment.
The District Court obliged Post to pay most of the employee's remuneration and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Posti could have arrested only part of the inquisitor’s salary, which corresponded to the share of the education throughout the day’s work.
According to the district law, the employee had been placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activities, contrary to the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the decision of the Union for Posti and Logistics to prohibit the introduction of the PAU.
During the postal strike last November, PAU decided that Post’s employees would not be able to familiarise themselves with the renters who broke the strike.
It was the People's News first.
Turkey's return to a path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respective development, written by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter to Sipila and Soin, the Union of Journalists previously asked to express its concerns about the freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland has repeatedly highlighted to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression.
Putin separated the head of his administration from the Estonian-based Vain.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has separated Sergei Ivanov, Head of Presidential Administration, says the Kremlin.
The Soviet-Estonian Communist leader Karl Vayo's grandson Anton Vaino will be replaced.
He is a 44-year-old diplomat who has served as Vice-President of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax, a news agency.
Vladimir Putin fired the commander of his administration.
According to the Kreml Bulletin, Ivanov, a member of Putin’s tight inner circle, is transferred to specific environmental and transport tasks.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to another assignment and suggested that Heathe be replaced, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union spying on the KGB.
Many thought Ivanov was a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition of the game ban - not seen in the opening of Valoliiga
The world record man of football transfers is not seen in the field when the British Valolia is being kicked out this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed with him to England.
The Manchester United's giant acquisition of Paul Pogba, due to the ban, is being sidelined by ManU on Sunday against Bournemouth, said the BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, the Italian Society Juventus paid EUR 105 million from Pogba.
However, the English Football Association FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogbale was burdened with the ban on Juventus.
He received two warnings last season at the Italian Cup, and it will be a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is the league's second round on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, madness is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally respected event to be attended by the world's top artists.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festarics have typically expressed themselves with their own fashioned clothing.
One of the main stage artists is this year punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stowed, among other things, by artificial grass and art installations.
We have never had enough to have a main stage and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in Summer Bay of Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to the event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The basis for success is the simple question: What kind of event would the authors want to go to?
It's kind of different when you take an accident, that's what you think.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be here this year to sell out.
The aim has been to increase the number of people visiting last year by 5,000.
Even this year, a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists are seen at the festivals.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because it needs to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle guided by huge roads.
That's not what we want.
Over the past 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been enlarged with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurants and drink bars in a partly artificial grassed area.
In addition to the main stage and the smaller performance platforms, 15,000 people's tents will be the venue this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little bigotry, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done for Rock is that even today’s great visions are practically possible.
During the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, activities were highly dependent on the support of approximately 20 000 euros of the City of Helsinki.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was around EUR 6 million.
It's used to create "creiss stories", like building that 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves in their own fashion.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as a particularly fashionable event.
We want to be separated, above all, from the content.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit Flow's value world: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the top artists is a tick legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at a festival that combines inderock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was beaten, because now is probably the last time this is seen at a concert in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good, and he's been doing some damn good gigs in the last few years.
The bombs of Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in the purses, and the tourists fled in their horrors.
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died and over 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower trap and blown up by cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists began to leave the bars and return to their hotels, said the police representative, Sampoer Yoosumran, according to CNN.
Since 1989, the wild animal protector Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, has taken a lot of pictures of the attacks.
If the TV's not showing properly, you can watch it here.
Of those injured in Hua Hin, at least 11 were foreign tourists.
People ran against me and said that the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest streets of the bar, told Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet by the Swedish secretary.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon thereafter, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, even by the Finns.
No one is known to be dead.
At the same time, a second double-bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police told me they found at least one bomb on Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel troops behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the activities of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken on the activities of criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby team goes first into battle in the war situation
In an acute war situation, military officers are not ordered to fight until several months after the oath of military power, says the Central Finnishman.
According to the Chief of Education of the Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, Brig-Gen Jukka Sonninen, only those who are in the final stage of their training are eligible for battle in war situations, for example, for the five months served by the military.
According to the Head of Training, the first task is to appoint the reserve personnel of the Standby Forces.
None of the backup or reserve personnel are ordered to perform a mission that has not been provided with the required training, says Sonningen.
Earlier in the summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces are starting to train their guards into immediate preparedness units from next year.
The units may be used in military operations, if necessary, as early as the training of the military staff.
Pamela Tola got the huge compensation from the home.
Actor Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey separate house had been EUR 330 000.
After trade, however, the house revealed a serious moisture problem that caused a dangerous microbial growth in health.
The couple had to sell the apartment as a disembarkation in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss for Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and there demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The salesman denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in the district court and court.
The court ruled on the matter on Wednesday.
It maintained the judgment of the district court, which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for a price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the costs of the couple's legal proceedings and settlements.
The court justifies the price reduction slightly, since some of the need to repair the dwelling had already been known to the buyers when they made the house purchase.
However, according to court law, the errors that occurred were more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home.
In court, Tola told me that the couple had been looking for a good home because they did not want to do any repairs.
He had been given the impression that the building had been renovated and in good condition and that the points mentioned in the health check report were not detrimental.
The fitness check report identified the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rainwaters and melting waters throughout the rock study.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it was not clear that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma thought that some rainwater from the rock should be controlled within a few years.
The transactions were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the housing moisture problems were much more serious than expected.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which according to the Witnesses were due to both rock rainfalls and capillary ground moisture.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector, also reach indoors through the porch.
A home-care room, basement stairwell, living room window, and a basement washroom were found with sand or sand that allowed a health risk, which exceeded the limit values.
Steels were built without permits
The court also contested whether the dwelling had been extended contrary to the building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that the dwelling had been subject to an illegal change.
Among other things, the terraces had been built even though there were no appropriate permits.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Justice, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the sale, the purchasers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for substantial repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma felt that the court court had no particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection.
The purchasers have not failed to fulfil their reporting obligations, the Court of Justice states in its judgment.
Horrible Archive: Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for the Nazis - also Finns in the register
In his recent article on Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Andersson writes how microfilm documents have been recorded in the National Archives of Maryland in the United States regarding a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of women are Germans, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted Nazi bridesm.
The documents and registration cards come from the Nazi-German racial agency.
The Bureau of Racial Affairs was under the leadership of the SS, Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was even more true for women who had to be able to bear up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were carried out in women to find out.
The Bureau of Breeders examined women’s backgrounds, including by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the female family tree.
Women also needed to be ready to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give life stories written to the racial agency, as well as good recommendations from close ones.
The Bureau wanted guarantees that women were "loved children", "sustainable" and "good national socialists" who knew very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as bridesmaids of SS men.
The case does not describe what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
The SS leaders created a state-sponsored programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme provided, among other things, that each SS man should have four children, whether married or not.
Lebensborn homes care for children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not promoted very actively, as the website of the U.S. Holocaust Museum reports.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The State encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
A German mother’s honorary cross was awarded to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website says.
The sixth of Petjah-Sir, Nirko rose and fell
Tapio Nirko was ranked third in the Finnishjolls' first day of departure at the Rio Olympic Games, but remained the tailing peak of the entire group on the second day of departure.
In the overall situation, Niko rose eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second departure put him in position 14.
Wind Petjajai-Siren fought for RS:X day slots 17 and 3.
In the overall situation, Petaja-Siren is the sixth.
In the 470s, Jonah and Niklas Lindgren remained in position at the opening of the day 23.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are ranked 19.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours' sleep, "I was so in the canoe."
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the favourite Finnish artists for more than 20 years.
From the cruiser barmaid to the 1995 Tango King, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of the dance platforms and festivals, the Bridgepää continues to pollinate and is currently in a wild rise.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen, on the life of the favourite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book The Bridgehead tells of his life and career as good as evil.
The career of the bridgehead rose to a total rise when he won the crown of the Tango King in the Tango Market of the Seinäjoki River in 1995.
In the contest, Bridgehead sang rods, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had, at the request of a man, composed a tango piece that Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in the history of Finnish music.
The book says, however, that recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: The bridgehead sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so in the canoe!
The bridgehead remembers in the book.
You wouldn't think it'd be singing in a hangar.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that all the time I don't have to demand the perfect and the best of myself.
Another incident related to the most popular songs of the man, as reported in the book, took place almost twenty years later.
In 2013, the bridgehead broke up with his partner at the time, and the case finally ended up in texts of You deserve gold, which was published as a single copy in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs that Sarah Törmäse ordered were not what the Bridgehead would have wanted.
The bridgehead had imagined that he was making a record telling a true story about his own life, but the words of the paragraph telling the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news in the magazine for 7 days.
In the news of the magazine, the difference between Jari and the ex-lover was explained by Jari’s excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was a full bunny, and it was not true.
According to the book, Jari was angry at the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it, and so it was good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
At the end of the day, 52% of voters voted for the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the polling week's opinion polls anticipate the opposite outcome.
British economicists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for the divorce, although a couple of individual researchers were allowed to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The main mantra of Western politics, the theme of the former US President Bill Clinton's earlier election campaign, "It's the economy, towers", flew into a ruin in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curvature
The Centre for Macroeconomics will respond to the Brexit disaster in its latest monthly survey.
The most typical answer is not to listen to the economists, because this time the voters took a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation by the economicists of the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of employees, which is almost standard.
If the immigrant gets a job, it's from the right British.
Many people also have the impression that the fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing, as it will contribute to the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economics Committee, voters did not believe the financial arguments, because the consensus of the economicists was not sufficiently developed.
In particular, they were driven by the equity of the BBC, which gave just as much space to economic scientists in favour of the EU's economic difference as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU's hateful press was not interested in telling what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE thought and other economic power combinations about the consequences of the difference.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both heard and understood, they were ignored because the economists represent an elite with which the voters do not think they have common interests.
Academics such as economicians would have stayed in the EU, but the message did not work in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is an economy, too.
The overwhelming victory argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrants take your job, Immigrants rush your hospital, Immigrants take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Each cafe has foreign employees.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British get medical appointments if they weren't?
Every school has children for immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the children of the true British to get a place of school if they were rid of them?
In every municipality, foreigners live.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economicists failed to respond and, if they did, their answers were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and particularly EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen's real estate fund reserved for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments were made by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, the Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
The plan for B, the victory of the EU's division, was prepared more precisely a few weeks before the vote in case the result was lost.
The concern was that investors would begin to withdraw their funds from the market.
As a rule, real estate funds do not have substantial liquid resources, but could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, the Old One says that Aberdeen's only open daily quote from the real estate fund that was covered by the news.
According to the old man, the normal level would be 15-20%.
At the time, the value of the fund was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is about £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimates that the lowest cash in these funds remained at 10% or even below.
Thus, the real estate funds reserved themselves for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funding to close trade
When the EU-restricted camp won, Europe went nuts.
However, the less than two weeks that followed the vote on the real estate market were quite peaceful, says Olden.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a high risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first real estate fund, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
Together, they robbed the situation and raised the case to the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared immediately with 2007 and 2008, says the Old One.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calm, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball began to spin, and the fund had to close its doors after each other.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close down trade, but changed prices downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it is worth pulling money out in panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't be worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed down the situation, and most of it canceled the announcement.
Since then, it has been quite steady, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks, says the Old One.
He points out that, for example, the continental European funds in Aberdeen did not have any similar shock.
But there were a lot of questions.
disproportionate attention to real estate funds
The old man felt that the closures of real estate funds were over-represented.
The open funds concerned by the closures account for about 4% of the property in Britain.
Aberdeen’s closure lasted six days and the company sold less than ten properties out of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold on to its funds until the end of 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not seem to be 'serious' to Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound and dollar exchange rate is at its weakest in 30 years, and in addition, the market has a 15 % reduction compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar maker can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There's a lot of willing buyers, says the old man.
Brexit brought mines to the London real estate market
At 2 o'clock in the morning, the situation didn't seem too much different.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who was responsible for the real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
There's a strong word for it.
I realized this is going to plan B now, says the Old One in his second home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
The City of London was already fully alive despite the night of the morning.
The TV screens that were normally set to be silent at the office provided news, and normally loud people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell about his divorce.
When the market opened up, the screen terminals flashed only red.
It was a morning you never thought you'd be alive, says the Old One.
It is not, therefore, that, in spite of the storm in Aberdeen, one of the biggest real estate funds in Britain, concluded two real estate transactions on the day following the Brexit vote.
It was a mess.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, so the situation was somewhat peaceful, says Olden.
The Brexit vote started with the correction movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership switched.
The market was beginning to anticipate severe fallouts on the property market in Britain and, in particular, London.
In the coming years, up to 20% of the mines were projected at London office facilities.
Soon a number of real estate funds in Britain began to freeze their trade one after the other.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it is not visible on the face of the Old Man who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
In his view, it is far too early to say much about what is going on with Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been first reported.
CBRE’s data on price developments cover about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, minus 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists it.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, says Olden.
All the equally large falls hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting that Brexit was compared very quickly with Lehman's fall and with the global economic crisis that started on the US real estate market.
The old man feels that the parable is not quite correct, because this is a British crisis.
There's another mood, too.
The real estate market has now seen not a panic sale like that, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Olden.
There's also a standard financial cover.
The repair shop could have been in the front anyway.
In fact, he doesn't think it's a miracle that there could have been such a thing without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of London’s and other world’s number one buildings have been too high for years.
For two years, we have said that City and especially the offices are overpriced, says the Old One.
So the fall started really high.
London's prices have gone up for four reasons, the Old One's list.
The British economy has grown strongly, so has the London population.
Another big trend is that properties are the last class of ownership that is globalized, says the Old One.
New players have become markets in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are also looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fed by low interest rates, which have led pension companies, for example, to looking for revenue from new items.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although the debt lever has now been used in the Old One's opinion much less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, disperse
In London, price rises stabilised last summer, says the Old One.
Aberdeen also started to lighten its holdings in London, and last year was a net seller.
There was some kind of turnaround to be expected, and now it's here.
What's from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says the Old One.
He does not dare to judge what is to come, but he says that there is hardly any ascension.
The atmosphere indicates that there is a descending or steady running ahead.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the holes can be survived by work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, it's too much of a victim.
If you've been disbanded, the risks are also decentralised, the Old One says.
The S-Group will start to register the purchase information more closely than before.
Soon S-Group will know what you are eating, as today the trading group told us that it is starting to collect more accurate information about its customers' purchases.
Once the information has been collected so far from the total amount of the receipt, the group will start to absorb it from the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S-Group is here after Kesko, as data on goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a few years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data are collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing on an authorised basis.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, says Riitala to the economic message.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to the S-Group registration change.
Kesko is already classifying its parent client into ten groups according to just grocery stores.
The classification shall be updated on a monthly basis.
Customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money they spend on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from K Group's own chains.
Co-operation partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer program and is not planning to do so.
Finland's Close Trade has its own 1st Bonus customer program, which can be associated with Valitalo, Siwok and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect product or product group information, we stick to the total amount of receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made, and that's the day, and the final amount of the client's receipt.
We have not gone to that level as K-Group or S-Group, says commercial leader Anu Ora.
According to him, the main customer programme is to be reformed in the future, but the Close Trade will tell you about it later.
However, the Ora does not allow registration of product information.
At the beginning of the experiment
The customer register of SOK’s customer owner and customer register has been relatively wide up to now.
In addition to personal and address data, the basic data included occupation, education, form of residence and children's birth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role have also been registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, the total amount of purchases and the method of payment have been recorded in the purchase of the S-Certificate.
In addition, the S-bonus partners’ data have been obtained from their cash-flow systems.
From the beginning of May, product level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains, data are currently recorded at product group level.
Customers have long been hoping that marketing could be more targeted, says Marjaana Saarikoski, head of the customer and partner activities of SOK.
The S-Group says that they will inform their customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data are stored in the funds anyway, whether they want it or not.
A willing person can check his stored information on the S Group website.
For example, the cashiers do not have access to the information, says Saarikoski.
Video: The Heila puppy is Customs's newest dog confirmation - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador Puppet is vigourfully sniffing five similar boxes placed in line in the country at Helsinki Airport.
It won't take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio will reward his Heila dog to play it with his favorite toy.
The box next to which Heila sat revealed a jar of smelting casings.
Square gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of Heila.
Security situation and internet commerce access
Heila is Customs’s first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports, if necessary.
However, the airport will be the main job of Heila, as international security has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in Customs and, after the attacks, control has been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, customs inspector.
The second way to train an armed and explosive dog is by post through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, up to 40 million mails are sent annually through the airport, which may include arms and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made internet shops at Helsinki Airport, from shopping, passenger baggage and air cargo to approximately 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their starting materials.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It's going to look into checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is very keen on the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of the Heila pup is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonum.
Suntio is also in training with Heila at the police and Defence Forces experts.
Police have strong experience in dog training and defence expertise in explosives.
Customs will decide together with other authorities what smells Heila will be taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are six drug dogs in Customs, as well as money and drug dogs Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for selecting the dog to be selected at the airport include a dredging and hunting season, as well as calmness, as the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion’s home, is a close associate with the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't go anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio's laughing.
Pregnant orders come to Heila from a one-time camp.
The cameraman of the evening-Sanomies loses the camera mike cover for the fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-looking shield immediately from the "out" command.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila's initial education will be completed next year.
There are still standard tests ahead, next in October, which assesses whether training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen in work on the side of Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron the dog on the working vests, similar to Suntio.
The cost of a single working dog is about EUR 60000 70000 per year for customs.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten years, after which they retire in the care of their owners.
Working days may be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active part-times can only last from ten to two hours.
The owner of working dogs is a tough competition in Customs.
The owner of Heila was about 20-30 Customs employees.
Luck hit Suntion, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in Customs.
The Ministries got their first Olympic medal. People get a day off.
The Olympic gold of Fiji, less than a million inhabitants, in rugby, is so highly valued in the country that the government has ordered August 22 to be a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcasting company, the Fijian government confirmed the issue after the championship was resolved.
The day off is the day after the team's return.
There are also festiveities for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team is celebrating the championship.
The Guardian reports that the finals were followed in the capital of Suva, where a screen had been set up for the stadium.
Normally, only the native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage it, said Fiji Times reporter to Maicle Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish Buyer passed out after a wild performance
Milko Tokola, a printing company, succeeded from 175 kg after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening quality as a lift.
During or immediately after heavy liftings, he has passed out many times.
No one's really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola received 175 kilos of push and 145 kilos of push.
His combined result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get her job at the last 175 pounds, as did one.
With the third attempt, the weights rose as a result of the wild roaring.
The body was shaking under the weights until the jury accepted the lift.
The joy of the Finnish collector was expressed by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired the Estonian instigator Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Evening Sayomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, playing in the Men's Football League, has concluded a lasting agreement with the Estonian protagonist Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a leading player for our team, who has power and has a small threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi.
Over ten players and I went through more than 50 players from all over the world.
As a good alternative, Prosa, coach of the RoPS, Juha Malinen, began to stand out from the crowd.
Prosa, 25, arrives in RoPS from Tallin, Florida, where she scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played on the Estonian national team.
Prosan is due to be with RoPS already on Saturday in the Seinäjoki River, where the Rovaniemins meet the ruling Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's secular king Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
A proud Modern Family star once again, the teenage star shorts reveal almost everything.
As a nice Alex Dunphyna introduced to the modern family comedy series, Ariel Winter is once again admiring his proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in minisorts that don't leave much to imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his butt.
Lately, 18-year-old Winter has attracted attention by making his style and behaviour much more courageous.
The star has posed in his social media photos in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressed in very scarce suits.
Winter, on the verge of adulthood, has also recently published several pictures of himself celebrating.
If the picture doesn't show, you can look at it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked the experts why Winter has changed his image so radically.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter would have a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost all his life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you show the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started out in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has annoyed some of his long-term fans with his image transformation.
It is not difficult to guess where she will be in ten years, when the tide is now so hard, says a woman in Winter's Instagram.
Some of her fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge her not to care about the criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what the others say.
You're an inspiration to many women, a young woman.
The Japanese prefer to go from the Nordics to Finland - tourists are attracted to the northern part: In autumn it is possible to see the random mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start their northern northern northern northern northern northern Finland, says Visit Finland in the newsletter.
The main destinations of Japanese northern tourism are Inari and Levi.
The northern lights are the card of our winter travel, and they are strongly connected to the heart winter and the snowy landscapes.
In the winter of Lapland, the northern windmills have a lot of demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
It is rare to know that the reventing season begins early in the autumn and continues far into the spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision two times a fairytale, says Anne Lind, Marketing Manager of Visit Finland.
Visit Finland's main target group is wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey carried out by Aalto University and researchers from the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like clearer unique attractions from Finland, and this northern windmill, according to Lind, has enormous potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown much more in Finland than the other Nordic countries.
Last year they stayed more than twice as long in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finnish tourism as a target group, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain had to be satisfied with the silver rugby-7 race when Fiji's champion team won gold
The impressive success of Great Britain in the seven Rugby Games broke in a crushing way when Fidzi won it on Thursday in the finals at the Rio Deodoro Stadium at 43-7.
Fidzi gave a master's lesson in ball handling, transfers, side damage, support game, running lines and brutality and won gold – if there was the first Olympic medal in the history of the country.
The loss meant silver, which was a little thinner comfort for Britain, as it was the third silver day of the country. They can be proud of their success as an Olympic race for the first time in the rugby-7 tournament, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The strong victory of South African Boxes in 7-5 semifinals earlier that day could have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Nevertheless, in this form, Fiji's team would have won the British, even if the 15-person team had been in full power.
Great Britain may be comforted by the fact that at least one Britishman will have a gold medal tomorrow: Chief Coach Ben Ryan of Fiji, former English rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
It's been quite an experience for Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games in the Adelaide Sevens tournament in Ryan's training.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
Loss is painful, but progress is startling.
Fidzi was a great starter and presented his fighting skills to Great Britain as a pleasure.
It seemed as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his teams had run into moving buses, and world champions rose to 5-0 lead when Osea Kolinisau crashed into the corner.
When it was four minutes, Jerry Tuwai scored a second goal on the right side of the goal.
Situation 12-0, and Britain had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell’s wonderful tack prevented the rational Leone Nakarawa from making a third goal, but it did not slow Fiji down.
After seven minutes of the game, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner, after which Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa scored a second goal for the start, with the first half of the game time remaining more than a minute.
After this Vatemo Ravouvou crashed through the more powerful battles of the British team and crashed across the finish line.
After the paint kick, the opening period ended between 29 and 0.
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play the seven-player rugby, while the British are still in the role of the apprentice.
Which is very true.
The United Kingdom made extensive changes in half-time and managed to hold the Fijian whole four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored due to the excellent team game of the Fijian team.
Dan Norton managed to narrow down 36–7 by paint Britain in the left corner, but the game had long since been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose fans sang in the audience, waving their flags and dancing.
Fiji’s purely cheerful attitude was difficult not to admire.
Mata Viliame scored a final sleigh into the Fidzian cake with the goal in the final moments.
The whistle rings, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell into the field, completely crushed.
In the past day, Fidzi had won the Japanese semifinal by 20 to 5 and Great Britain had crammed past South Africa at a tight semifinal, where the balance was solved by the UK goal.
Kyle Brown took South African Boxs to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal line with his dazzling footwork and fell under the goal poles in the second half.
Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony Watson, the 15 England players rugby team, seals the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
The more emotional this could not be gold in these games.
From the first bet to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed with 220 winning bets into history and found additional purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although the two of them were in the air, the third sound of coach Robin Williams in the boat was inspired by their second consecutive Olympic gold in the twins of women, making them the first women in the history of British sport to reach the same achievement.
Their supremacy was undisputed, the victory for them was already 39 consecutive and once again record.
What we see is not entirely in line with the nature of success.
There are a great number of helpful hands behind each row gold, each of which has contributed to the twins. However, the most important of the assistants is a coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who did not know if he would see this day.
Williams said the situation was tight at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor was able to cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would've been pretty bad.
It changes the way you think."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the season of the species at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible if this is the case in such circumstances.
"I needed money, so I had to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the section 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said that a few steps were enough.
That's where it starts.
The race itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the thoughts of the two were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than normal when he tried to overcome his own unrest.
The British royal artillery regiment, Captain Stanning, who had a tour of Afghanistan, says: "This week I have been in ruins, which may be a little extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we've worked together with Helen and Robin.
For the last three years, Helen and Robin's bank account have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank you so much for him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The two have found an overwhelming rhythm to which their competitors have failed to compare.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the twins of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had additional resources.
"We were very tight in a moment.
Helen said, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It's very important not to get off the road."
"We managed to leave well, and at the same time we did not try to do anything wonderful.
We didn't want the sky today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race we did."
The two will think for a year before deciding their future.
Glover's celebrating next month with Steve Backshall, who is familiar with the nature programs of television.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"After London, it took me about six months before I realized I was the Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time, it took about four minutes to realize.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland will change the government of the Panaman leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which will be called for by the infuriated protestors of the Panaman data leaks already in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians were circumventing taxes by means of tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for protestors.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold a new parliamentary election in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
Analysts say that it is difficult to predict how much the people's last - spring rage influences the result of the autumn election.
In June, the presidential election showed a clear criticism of the authorities, and Gudni Johnson, who was elected from outside politics, was elected President.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isis.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump of the United States has withdrawn his latest court-martials.
He said that he was sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organisation Isis and the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would be involved in the establishment of the organisation.
The Democratic Party got angry with speeches and asked Trump to apologize.
As chief of the army, you should never let anyone fall down like that, Clinton's TV.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a masked burkini swimsuit popular by Muslims on the beaches, says, among other things, the British magazine Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for everyone who has no good manners and a bathing suit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear, which largely express religious ties, can increase the risk of disorderly conduct in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice, while a 31-year-old man drove to the crowd celebrating France's National Day.
At the end of July, two extremities connected to Isis attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the screening - the blue-shoeing drizzle in Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only a blue ling has been observed on Lake Pyykösjärvi's bathing area.
During Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the environmental activity of the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU coasts and 30 other public bathing sites in the Oulu region.
Apart from the coast of Meriniemi, the concentrations of all bathing waters of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in bathing areas were below the limits of the measures laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E. coli and enterococcals in the shore of the Meriniemi bathing area were confirmed on Wednesday, when the levels of bacteria had fallen below the operational limits.
The blue liquefaction found on the shore of the pier lake does not yet make the water unswimable, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue lush flower, resulting in the formation of a blue green levage in the water.
Environmental action will monitor the situation by means of increased inspections.
In the event of a change in the colour of the blue leaching, the information shall also be provided separately on the bathing beach declaration table.

MTK’s Hakarainen Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The reduction of forest gifts is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax for the generation of forest holdings.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal for a reduction in forest gifts has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to promote the age structure of forest owners, to increase forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry's aim is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would make a reduction in the clean income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational change of forest holdings is a good one, comments Juha Haharainen, Director of Forests of the Central Union of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, it is difficult to find a criticism in the proposed tax change.
The reduction of forest gifts is proposed for the forest owner’s clean capital income.
This is the capital income minus any other deductions.
According to MTK and Haharinen, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the result of the sale of the wood.
The VM's proposal is based on a reduction in the net income of forestry, which prevents loss of income from forestry, which would be deducted from other taxes.
Such a person would benefit from tax even if he did not sell the wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner can't see it, says Hakarainen.
In addition, he said that the model concerns only a small part of the forest owners.
The tax reduction threshold linked to the income of the forest is EUR 40 000.
It's been pulled too high in Haharinen's mind.
As such, he said that 82 percent of Finnish forest owners were cut off from the district.
The model would affect about 10% of forest ownership, he says.
The VM considers that the border guarantees the objective of growing the farm size.
In forest policy, the reduction of forest gifts has been taken by Haharinen for decades.
It is due to an ageing forest-ownership.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently more than 60 years and about half of the forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful raid surprised the drivers at Himanga... two cars went down into a ditch and hit each other.
There was a special chase in the Himanga of Kalajoki on Friday morning.
According to the rescue unit, two consecutive cars went down into a ditch, and the rear came after the driver.
According to the chief firefighter Harri Pyht, the demise of the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a powerful raid.
There were two people in the back of the car who were both transported to the hospital for treatment.
There's no more detailed information on their injuries.
The driver of the previous car was not injured.
The accident happened on highway 8 from Himanga a few miles to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more effectively.
Professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group’s findings show that the severity of cancer cancer increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer medications may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and the surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results have been published on 4 August in the prestigious Nature Communications magazine in the field of cell biology.
The tree of the Muhos family death continues in the court, the prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for the other person who did it.
The tree of the Muhos family death continues in the court for both convicted.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the death of a family home in Muhos.
One received 8 years of 4 months for, among other things, killing and gross robbery as a young person.
One is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder and gross robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of killing was also convicted of a gross endangerment of road safety as a young person and of the right to transport a vehicle as a young person.
The District Court’s judgment was appealed to by the prosecutor, the prosecutors and the man who received the harsher sentence.
The prosecution demands that a man who has been punished for murder as a young person be sentenced to 12 years in prison.
They were at the time of the act in full understanding.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old young people killed a man who worked as a head of the Child Protection Unit at the school home in July of last year.
The 17-year-old who was sentenced to murder attacked the pilot who sat on the couch of the living room behind the verdict.
The director had come out of the grip and dragged a young man into his room, when one of the young ones hit him with a suction tube.
Among other things, the director was strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the mind poll, both convicted were at the time of the act fully understood.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape from the family home at least from the previous day.
The ice shark is the longest-aged vertebrate in the world, growing only at 156 years of age.
The world’s longest living vertebrae is a secure ice shark, says a study published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, like the ice shark swimming around Greenland, the holler can live up to 400 years of age.
The female is only growing at 156 years of age.
The more life I spent in the ice shark, the only thing growing is a centimetre a year.
Only one species of bivalve molluscs is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Researchers found his age by radiocarbon dating.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950s, there were radioactive residues in some sharks.
They enabled researchers to assess the age of sharks.
It was estimated 392 years for the elder's age, though a throw in the direction or another could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic visa - People's News
The Americas of Donald Trump don't need to change the world.
Even a third of the State's total tax revenue would not be received if the change in the corporate tax imposed by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular with tax relief for the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
Business tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without collection, there would be a huge amount of $1 000 billion a year.
The highest rate of income tax is now 39.6, after the discount presented by Trump 33.
The inheritance tax would be completely waived.
Trump accused the State of over-regulation of the business and the bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental standards decided on by the emergency must be reformulated and the energy regulation must be decommissioned.
The health reform of Barack Obama must be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed 'experts instead of bureaucrats'.
According to Trump, 'dumping' trade policy is one of the major causes of the problems in the United States.
The free trade agreements would be waived.
45% of imports from China and 35% of Mexico would be subject to a penalty tax.
We're offering you a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
The Americas of Donald Trump do not need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will unite cities, American ships will control the sea, American steel will lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his manners, Trump faithfully read a speech written by his assistants, even though well - organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists - including those close to the Republicans - will see Trump's program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced Finnish time early on Friday.
Attack wave from the past - People's News
The sea is killing me, but a real wave of attack strikes in the middle of Madrid's street violet - an account with the past can begin.
That summed up Pedro Almodóvar's novelty story.
Almodovar's previous guidance Travel lovers (2013) were a little fun and a bunch of satirical comedy, the previous skin where I live (2011) the peaks of the Spanish style career.
Similarly, Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It's a romantic love, relationship and family drama, with a mother-daughter relationship at the heart of it.
The story is simple and we see a lot of it as a long backdrop.
Life seems to be on the line for a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of random encounters, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) must be amazed to the end of the film.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Julieta repeated the stages of her life to her adult daughter.
She begins from the time before the birth of her daughter, from the times when she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, rises to the second main part of the TV series, the time between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a homicidal, but I would like to say that it is rather a symbiotic and literally one-off.
Almodóvar films often have a fair distance in Julieta to such a characteristic rumbler.
It is an equally played, controlled, place with good music and a rather sad film with elements for elegance.
On the other hand, the Spanish director’s typical visual color abundance is maintained and begins to put a little silence into the eye as a pure form rather than as a functioning dramatic means of action.
People in the film are affected by diseases, deaths or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This applies in particular to the costume: in the case of a nominal person, the costumes change from scene to scene, and the same applies to visible ears.
Almodóvar is very careful in these matters, but the main thing, i.e. the movements of each scene, are not particularly improving.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly breathless.
Almodóvar has written the manuscript on the basis of three short stories by Canadian Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize for 2013.
Novellit has been published in Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a bit of equal-fat written literary filmation.
The subject matter of the film would have been inevitably dramatic even more, so many big things - especially the fading guilt - are dealt with by the subject matter.
Control and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novels from Alice Munro.
Mainly Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying to do an election game - People's News
No new cuts will be made, the ministers say, so that the basic Finns do not collapse completely.
However, the operations decided in the spring will be carried out by a huge trade.
There will be no new surgery.
The 4 billion savings already decided are sufficient.
Thus, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Central Minister of Finance) are convinced under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, because the social security cuts were already decided in the spring framework.
Children's pensions, national pensions, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pension Index will be reduced by 0.85%.
The duration of unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training is continuing.
The locals haunt
Why are ministers so hard to stress that no new cuts are being made on these?
Because next year's the election year.
The municipal halls will be held in April and they will be the main heat meter of the parliamentary term, not the gallupes.
It has been seen in the past that the result of the municipal elections in the different directions of the government parties is ruining the government's mood for a long time.
However, the Gallup report that the Government Party's basic Finns are facing a sharp loss, although the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns of Finland received 752 new councillors, most of which will be realised in the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeline of the government of the three parties of approximately equal size is dependent on the endurance of the base Finns.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those voting in the party have had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group have also come to the surface.
First of all, the rhetoric of the new cuts does not obscure the fact that next year they will be made harshly and, second, try to soften the expectant attack on the basic Finns.
Large surgery in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set itself the objective of breaking down debt during this parliamentary term, but the budget proposal by Mr Orpo will be owed EUR 5.9 billion next year, i.e. more than this year.
After the municipal councils, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt is neither protracted nor even slowing down.
One is to hold on to the program.
It means newer cuts to the former ones in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would at least be placed close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring, it will be adopted in the parliamentary elections.
These measures do not give rise to a degree of debt
It is quite clear that the current measures do not tend to lead to debt, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to stimulate a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by the Secretary of State at the awareness of the budget of Martti Hetemäen testify irreconcilably:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimal, i.e. veto aid from the international economy.
Since the collapse in 2008, the Finnish economy has not risen much, except during the temporary recovery policy of the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has increased from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
In the curves presented by the week, government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the mid-term of next decade.
What's responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt relief presented by the Left Union was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
In the next year, unemployment maintenance will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be fully covered by the new debt.
This is the concept of the centre, the assembly and the basic Finns of what is responsible.
Question: You want to leave a lot of work to the municipalities
Three out of four believe that the organisation of child day care, youth work and physical activity are the responsibility of the municipality, according to research conducted by the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people are also responsible for libraries, culture, civic schools, building supervision, high school education and waste management.
The responsibility for the region is more clearly sought by regional planning, specialised health care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with developmental disabilities.
There is no wish to transfer any tasks under the authority of the municipalities to the State.
At the end of the chase, a minor drinker ran away from the police.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist in Joensuu drove a police patrol in Ilomansinti, Joensuu, at 2:30 p.m. on Friday night.
Police patrol tried to stop a motorbike without lights, but a young man left to run the police for a fair speed.
The rear drive continued on the Sonkajanranta road, from which to the Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but the quickest cop ran into the fugitive.
The blow test for the driver showed 0.75 per cent.
Nor did he have a driving licence that would justify riding a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, inter alia, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the stone cargo fell into a ditch.
The truck in the stone cargo fell into a ditch on Lake Knee in Kaavintie at 21.15 p.m. on Thursday night.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved corner out of the way and fell on its side into a ditch.
The rescue unit lifted the injured driver out of the fallen truck through the door above the car together with the rescue helicopter personnel and first-aid nurses.
It was up to the car owner to pick up the vehicle.
From the crashed truck, hydraulic oil was poured into the road, which was absorbed into the peat by the rescue facility.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The old woman disappeared this afternoon in the Air River.
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Lahtinküla, South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about six feet [ 165 cm] long, thin and benign, with white hair below her jaw.
The findings and clues of missing movements are requested to call the Nordic Status Centre’s tip number 0295440513.
A major accident in the air - see the photo gallery on Parafest’s destruction
The flooding current that crashed the tents of the Parafest Festivals caused massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafestivities, estimates that the festival will be able to get to its feet economically, and the event can also be held next year.
Kalle Salonen, the last performer of the Parafest, appeared on the market at the end of the Friday night.
On Saturday, the programme will be continued with presentations at the premises of the city theatre starting at 13.00 p.m.
The Art Centre in Ahjo will have a Parafest exhibition between 1 p.m. and 3:00 p.m.
The programme will be organised as planned.
When rainwater and its weight trigger the falling air flow, the rush flow is generated in a thunderstorm.
Changes in the state of the thunder cloud water bind heat and thus cool down the falling air mass and speed it up toward the earth.
The Department of Aeroscience reports that several flooding flows occur in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the course of the flood currents.
The rush flow struck the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the scene of Parafest, on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents went down, there were about 200 people in the tents.
In an accident, four people were mildly offended.
There was one child in the group who was slightly injured by further treatment.
Air pollution obsolescence in London
According to the study, the skin of the Lontoans is ageing faster than usual.
Air pollution is the cause of skin ageing.
The English study is based on the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyses London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many pensioners in London is two and a half years older than a partner living in rural areas.
The skin - aging small particles are a very fine dust pollution, which comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, almost 9,500 Londoners die every year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early aging is a risk, especially for those in London who walk their journeys around congested streets.
People in London may try to protect themselves from air pollution by, for example, different masks, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed the man in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor flowed over the man.
The man was not under it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital seriously injured for further examination.
The tractor did not flow any further, as it ran into the stones in front of it.
Rising with the latest force for the coming season
The League-Riento, which plays at the volleyball Championship, starts in October from a better starting point than the male memory.
The team's been together for three weeks.
The common song can be found with certainty better than in the previous seasons, when the start of the series has been darker for Rienno.
Jani Siäisä, who continues as the main coach of the cheer, commends the new team as entrepreneurship and unity.
Out of the three foreign countries, Fred Musoni will begin his second season in Riento.
The new face is 23 years old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson on Rwanda's country team is a 205-inch hacker.
Garchet, like, is a passport, and the Brazilian one has 198 cents.
Josban, Kataja and River Boys to the US National Team
Anne Jopartneren has played in almost all the hallband World Cups since 2003.
Now Tampere is already in the sixth race, only 2013 was missed in Canada's better cutbacks in North America.
I was working in Turku and playing with the women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up the Salibandy country team.
I was interested and here we are, Partner, 48, says.
The partner was born in 1967 near New York City of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987, the Partner got to the University of Joensuu to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, that kind of game was not yet played at the MS level as a salibandy.
It's just that they used to play the flute at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja, and later in Jokipoji, I played hockey in the MS series.
The partner played with the university in the Salibandy's MS series for the 1991-92 season, and the following three took place in Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the A-girls of the club for the championship.
The women's SM-series career peaked in silver in 1995.
In total, the Partner played in the women's marker series through 10, and the balance was in 169 matches 51+34=85.
The most recent MS period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Vänänen were appointed to the country team
The Joensuu Salibandy Association was raised by Perttu Puska and the Enoli-based Tatu Vänänen was selected for the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech Brnon EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, an attacking 25-year-old in Helsinki, has played this game before six male field matches, where he has accumulated total power points 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old Swiss defenseman, Tatu Vänänen, has recovered from the femur and is part of the country team's standard equipment with 117 ground fighting experiences.
Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in the Finnish shirt last time in the World Cup last December, was also appointed to the national team.
The main coach of the Salibandy County team is Petri Kettunen, a Contiolahtian.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes to Kouvola - marker gold is missing from the award box
Essi Hasu is finishing up as a beach volley player, at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish championships for Beach Volley will be awarded at Kouvola Sports Park at the weekend.
During three days, the medals will be played in series of adults and young people.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volleyballers and the Finnish Volleyball Association, six of the best pairs of each series's rankings are eligible for the MS finals.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been at the top of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many as possible get to the scene this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for the pesis stadium.
I haven't played in adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, funny mood.
The Kouvola region lit Hasu’s spark for sport and gave good food for a fine hobby.
There are well memories of childhood.
I started the volleyball at the age of nine in the E-girls of Elimäe's NMKY.
The top is too big a toy shirt in the mind, kneecaps in the ankles as well as great asshunts and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small locality, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group's spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone's families were very active. The father of a teammate trained us, and our mother was the chairman of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasulle a beach volley was already a natural species selection for the inner balloon during the junior age.
Since the 1990s, there has been a band playing on the beach of the mountain.
The action has always been active.
I also went myself to watch the semi-finals of the juniors' marker tour, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays the weekend together with Anniina Parkkinen of the Peksämäki in the SM finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked double in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We're still missing the award box, Hasu throws a mystery.
The appearance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last in front of the familiar audience for Hasu.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civilian work await.
Yes, the international career is over after the tournament.
Otherwise, the toes will be nailed at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon Koli left bravely for the farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means taking risks, sweating and being energetic.
The young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he also believes in a positive future in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli and his little brother Valtter Kol began acting as a continuation of their home space.
Their father, Mark Koli, helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come into hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to be on the farm, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think we have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we left to build a driveway, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
But I was very bravely involved in the project myself, and I have been fully involved in it, Salomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything is going to be all right.
The goal of Solomon Kol, who grows meat cars, is to invest in an even bigger nave.
The work has produced results because Solomon Koli has been selected as the top ten in the contest of the young food producer in the future of rural areas.
At the moment, he's competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on on the website of the magazine until 21 August.

Snapchat’s anime effect is criticised as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter was inspired by an anime, but some observers think it is racist.
The Snapchat lens tool allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identity in ways that approximate absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lens are unpretentious, features-distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced self - trails per day.
All the missteps will quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have received criticism where it has been accused of favouring blackface makeup or bleached skin tones as a beauty thing.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes upside down, distorted their teeth and made their cheeks bumpy, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asian people ("yellowface").
The critics also wondered whether these repeated conflicts referred to the greater problem that the company has with the difference.
The news and rage spread widely on Wednesday and were written by e-mails The Verge and Motherboard on the day after Snapchat told that he had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was meant to be a tribute to anime characters, not to be the cartoon type of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some were vehemently arguing about an anime comparison.
The Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweet was widely distributed, said in his e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and awkward".
He adds: "It is difficult to deny the paralleling of a very tasteless Asian caricature to the effects of the filter.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yelllowface", but one that has been taken to a defamatory extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
The American culture seems to be fighting endlessly for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood and equipment that we carry with us.
The public in Snapchat consists of young people who are more ethnically diverse than their parents' counterparts, which can mean that they are likely to expect even more discretion.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, such things are no longer too easily overlooked, as previously," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu at the interview on Thursday.
Zhu, who works as a product manager and designer in the Medium publishing platform, decided on Thursday to remove his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In his article and telephone interview in the medium, he said that he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu mainly criticised the company's white and purely male board of directors and decided to write with hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that their one-sided staff does not have colored people, in which case they can make such decisions, or they also have colored employees, but their position is not such that they dare to express their views directly and easily" says Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to reply to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, drawing on its position as a private enterprise.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of its staff, but according to its informant, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on subordinated groups of people and promoting participation within the company.
For its part, Zhu says that he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not okay."
According to Congressional expert group, military officials were distorting ISIS intelligence.
On Thursday, the Congressional Expert Group published a report that US military officers, Central Command, changed the intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against Isis in Iraq and Syria than what the events in the field gave rise to.
According to analysts, the senior military authorities have been admiring American actions against Isis.
Central Command, briefly Centcom, is the United States Armed Forces headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence reports approved by the senior leaders of Centcom gave a more positive picture of US counter-terrorism activities than the facts on the field showed and were, by way of exception, more positive than the analysis of other units in the intelligence community", says the press release on the report.
"Centcom's events are unacceptable – our soldiers suffer when false analyses are presented to high-level political decision-makers," says Ken Calvert, California's Republican Member.
"The errors in Centcom's command portal extend to the top level of the organization."
The 10-page report on its scope describes in detail the continuing problems in 2014 and 2015 which include Central Command's descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that reports commissioned by the Obama administration have been forged, it gives an image of analysts, which gives the impression that the Centcom leaders would have pressured them to give a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isis.
"In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were much more positive than the events actually were," says the report.
"For example, Centcom's official made a public statement that a great military campaign to retake Mosul could take place in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under Isis' control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says Mike Pompeo, the Republican representative of Kansas.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence leaders of the US Armed Forces are manipulating the intelligence units received to minimize the threat to Isis in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a working group once they found out about the suspicions expressed by analysts that intelligence on Isis would have been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will follow up on more precise results, as the studies will continue.
In addition, the Ministry of Defence's chief inspector has launched an inquiry into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, democratic members of the Chamber of Representatives Committee published their own results, which were partly in line with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"Centcom created too limited a process between 2014 and 2015 to assess intelligence on the ISIS and the Iraqi security forces," says Adam B. Schiff, Committee High Representative for Democracy.
According to Schiff, this process "problemed the publication of intelligence results, "infringed the morals of analysts" and "inadequately dissenting views".
According to Schiff and the Democrats, however, there was no evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on the Centcom analysts to adapt their conclusions to the 'pre-determined or political official line'.
The news site Daily Beast reported on Tuesday on the preliminary findings of a survey by Congress.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon’s superintendent, initiated by the Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon informant, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, in his announcement, says that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on Congress's report as long as the Inspector General's investigation is in progress.
He says, however, that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
In addition to its efforts to find out whether the U.S.-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (one of the arguments put forward by several defence authorities), the investigation has also had other consequences.
However, the arguments put forward last year could call into question how much President Obama can count on the Central Commander and give honest estimates of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of the polls on individuals corresponds to the differences that occurred more than a decade ago when Gregory Hooker, Centcom's intelligence analyst, published a study that the government of President George W. Bush, despite the objections of many analysts, supported only small troops in Iraq and used little time to reflect on the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against Isis intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker Group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, the air strikes at the refineries controlled by Isis had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary refineries and was able to sell oil in the dark market.
However, the results of the study were not transmitted outside the Central Command, reports The Times in September.
Centcom's then commander General Lloyd J. Austin III was the subject of criticism last year after many legislators had estimated that the testimony given to the Senate was too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel, Commander of Central Command.
The United States wins the fourth duel in women's country hockey and consolidates its position in the settlement with Britain
After making three goals in the winning game, painting 6-1 in Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the US women's country hockey country team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had previously succeeded in the same way.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I'm not one of the people who likes to read about the paintings they've done."
But this is what he knows: the Americans have won four games in their Olympics tournament and lost a zero game and will share the first place with Britain in their group, which continued to win on Thursdays with Japan from 2 to 0.
On Saturday, Britain and the United States will play against each other in the last round of the first round.
Both teams survived the final match, which will determine which of them will be placed in the first and second readings of the six teams.
First, to avoid a longer encounter with a hard - held Dutch team who won the second in reading.
Despite what happens on Saturday’s game, the Americans have already raised their surprising success in these games, four years after it was the last of the 12 teams in the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell in Pennsylvania and took his country hockey bat for the first time only at the age of 3 (his parents played a double in Drexel). He got on the ground team at the age of 16 and was the youngest national team player of all time.
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he did not survive to the final list of players.
Then came the 2012 competitions, in which he and his team had little success.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an English coach, was appointed, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, spiritual and physical," says Bam.
"Our working rate in London was not what it is now.
We've done a full translation."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goal account in the first half by hitting the ball close by a knock-out.
India had entered the game without any tournament win, but it turned out to be a surprisingly hard opponent and maintained 1-0 until the third period when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball along the left side of the field for a long time, rolled to the center field, hit the ball in the finish line, leading the Americans to 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez scored in the middle of the fourth period.
The game was the first in the tournament, where U.S. goaltender Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the American goal had been sunk in each hit.
Mr. Briggs is now living on his success course.
Just like Bam.
"Our location is now good," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the result of the Saturday game.
In the middle of the Olympic halibut, trampolin brings zen
No matter where the place is, no matter how long it takes, the Olympics will inevitably come across.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to be the next passionate message throughout the world.
It is as if the Olympic fire itself was a fiery commotion, shifting from the archer to the swimmer, the swimmer to the gymnast and the gymnast to the triathlonist.
You can't open a TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in line at the cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The first-time Dooley charm of the Olympics with its smile and might well be a name on everyone's lips that would appear and be part of the best watch and listen time, would be preferred by sponsors and would appear in TV ads of good mind if he were just a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, from the California Lake Forest, 28, is competing for the Olympic gold on the trampoline.
The Olympic light does not illuminate all competitions on an equal footing.
Far from the center, part of the shadows are less well-known sports, such as air gun shooting, spring shoot, featherball and taekwondo.
We'll always have a breast swim, and let the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I'm allowed to write a modest story about my own special favorites, I'd like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampolin.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic race since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so limited that many of the people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic race.
Ignorance can be regional.
Of course, athletes from the United States have participated in the Olympic trampoline, but the country has never reached the medals and made progress to the finals until 2012.
In men's trampoline, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and the women's sides to the medal are the pale Canadians.
China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie MacLenna are defending the gold medals they won in London this year.
Trampoliin, however, has the charm of the underdog. Partly because of the uncivilized ear, it sounds more suitable for circus school than for the Olympic Games.
(I confess in this connection that I am not an expert, only an ordinary fan.)
The species have a comical potential, which has been used in the cartoons for the endlessly continuous cheering of characters, but it also has the same dignity as in gymnastics and swimming, i.e. the species that are essentially connected in the trampoline.
The word trampolin comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "twitchboard".
Honorable champions jump with a huge trampoline that sets them at a height of almost 10 metres. Before landing, jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements, such as twists, skill, and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, jumps are criticised on the basis of performance, severity and flight time.
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the trampoline force championship, 16 of which are men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight ahead.
In pursuit of gold, the measurement brain must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes across the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the finish line or the starting wall, they also have another goal they pursue in televisiond reports, namely the World or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is lofty, admirable, even fanatical — and enough to get a viewer to tears.
But I also find this to be a little exhausting just to watch the Games.
This is where the trampolin offers a break in the breath.
There's an upward trend in the trampoline.
The aim is not to move forward.
The gymnast will climb up unweightly like an astronaut, fall down, and snoop back up effortlessly.
Of course, the species also include a competitive aspect, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve an intense rush to the finish and a long jump, only a sleepy and melting combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to zen as only the Olympics can get there.
Women's games and finals will take place on Friday afternoon and start at 13.00 local time, and men's matches will take place on Saturday at the same time.
NBC sends the finals as part of their afternoon shipment, which starts on each day at 14.00 local time.
In the middle of the Olympic Mania, it brings a peaceful and wonderful moment that could be missed in the middle of a general rage.
And if awareness can only be raised by offering attractive male athletes and objectifying them, as recently suggested by the United States' male gymnasts, according to the Wall Street Journal, then Logan Dooley is only looking forward to his exciting new group of fans.
A whole generation protested in Ethiopia, a long-term ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently broken down protests that require political change across Ethiopia.
Witnesses say several protestors have been shot to death in conflict with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking down?
For the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable West ally whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations that are spreading to more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was ruthless.
Witnesses say the police fired and killed several unarmed protestors.
It is expected that at the end of last year or early this year, the demonstrations show how the security forces are beating young people with sticks who have been forced to stand by their hands against the wall.
The UN's leading human rights officer now calls for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep the country united, and it is even more difficult to move forward," says Rashid Abdi, Research Director of the International Crisis Group for the Horn of Africa project.
Since Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, whose stability has been promoted by the West.
The U.S. Army and intelligence support the Ethiopians closely in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia, and only a few African countries, if anything, will receive this much help from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, and Addis Ababa, the capital, is even a new urban area.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still a long way from the model country of democracy; human rights organisations have constantly reported on the government's repression policy, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly silenced.
Many people have been banished, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are repressed, and it has no choice but to show itself, it will disintegrate," says Seyouum Teshome, a lecturer at the University in Central Ethiopia.
"All young people show their point of view.
A whole generation protested."
There are many issues of dissatisfaction, from land use to the strangled grip of the government coalition.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last place previously owned by the opposition, as a result of which they now rule the whole of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing on the Eritrean border, where the aggravated situation required hundreds of deaths in the battle in June.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less overthrown separatist groups, such as Oromo’s emancipation front or Ogaden’s emancipation front, may try to exploit confusion and rearm up.
There are many reasons why the bitter mood that has been under the surface for years is breaking out right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
For the last few years, Ethiopians have only been able to communicate in social media, as cheaper smartphones became common and access to the Internet improved.
Even when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many access the Internet via proxy servers that hide their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this was how they called people to demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two main populations of Ethiopia, the ores and the Amhars.
The Oroms and the Amhars are not natural allies.
Amharas from high - Christian countries, in particular, Ethiopia, have long controlled the country’s politics and business and taken away the ores, most of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this is also changing.
"Cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Mulatu Gemechu, Director of Oromo.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Orom and Amhara regions.
Many Amhars and Oroms feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about six per cent of the population and yet controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is the death of Meles Zenaw.
Former Revolutionary Director Meles was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a disease that was not mentioned in 2012.
They thought he was a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
Analysts said that he was particularly skilled in detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and in using messengers to compromise the conduct of the counterparties.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict researcher Abdi.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, stepped into Meles's boots for almost ignorance.
Unlike Meles, from the Tigren region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemaram comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security forces under the Tigre tribe.
Many fear this means more bloodshed.
For the last time, similar riots occurred in Ethiopia in 2005, when thousands expressed their views against the elections, which according to analysts the government first screwed up and then stole.
In post-election unrest, many protestors were killed, though fewer dead than in the previous months, and the unrest stopped relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their forward-looking infrastructure planning, such as the new urban area, and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it has clearly not prevented internal resentment toward the Ethiopian government.
And the resentment is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, in Gondar, the Amhara City, protestors attacked companies owned by the Tigres, and hate speech against the Tigres is becoming more common in social media.
Analysts say that protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult situation.
The US Government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft monitoring the neighbouring country Somalia, but according to the United States, the base has recently been closed.
At the same time as the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This requires strict balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isis.
Donald J. Trump tried to withdraw his words on Friday in his latest campaign dispute by claiming that he was not serious this week, this week, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, as founders of the terrorist group Isis.
The clarification raised new questions on the Republican candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters are also in a painful situation, who must try to defend their candidate in these stormy moments and explain the comments he may not have meant.
Trump argued during the election on Wednesday evening and reiterated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the President and Hillary Clinton created Isis.
Early on Friday morning, however, Trump tweeted and said that his claim was sarcasm.
Trump completely rolled his speech in the twitter from the previous day, when I said he was serious about his accusations during several interviews.
When a radio drunk and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obama was trying to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate refused to withdraw his claim.
The latest critical storm arose when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy as the support figures fell.
Trump and Clinton gave their economic policy speech in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to come back to the subject again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and that Clinton's speech was boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received broad criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email. Later, he explained his comments by saying, "Of course I was sarcastic."
In this way Trump stretches the limits of political speech and pulls his words back if necessary.
"I believe that it is his way of testing certain messages that respond to his supporters. He sees how the supporters respond to the messages, and "clears it up" in one way or another," says communication expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are round enough to pass through different webs."
Instead of softening his statements to the general public, Trump has in recent days changed his style even more so when his support figures have continued to decline.
The new poll published on Friday by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist reported that Trump’s support is much lower in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while Florida is a tightly balanced situation.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
However, after being kept under more and more close observation in the last months of his presidential election, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position in which they have to publicly defend Trump's comments no matter how provocative they are.
One of Trump's most important supporters, former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, strongly defended the presidential candidate at CNN's interview on Thursday.
"I consider what he said to be justified, a political speech," Mr Giuliani replied when asked whether Trump was true in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton had established Isis.
"It is true in the sense that before Obama, Isis was almost unknown, a small organization, which Obama misguidedly called the "lower series team" and which is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most of the Republicans representing the mainstream are trying to claim that the Obama regime, where Hillary Clinton was Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed Isis to continue to act when it did not take decisive action in the Middle East.
Before the elections on Friday in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of taking his speech and discriminatory attitude towards him.
He mocked the "unable and pathetic" TV commentators who were trying to find out about him, but he said that they couldn't succeed.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation and said that it would only show even more clearly that he was not fit to be president.
The coffee shop in Greenpoint, which ended due to an excessive increase in rent, will open
The Verb Cafe was a slightly dirty cafe in Williamsburg, where only cash and no Wi-Fi were available, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the cafe was priced out of its streetside area on Bedford Avenue when the rent became unreasonable.
In the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie will sell soaps in the shape of cup cakes.
The locals consider this loss of a café that was forced to escape under middle-classization to be pathetic.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB Club is gone, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap store."
But even though New York is no longer the same, a new one is being created.
Last November, the Verb Cafe opened a new cafe in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb Café has Wi-Fi and you can pay with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unpretentious.
Coffee is still good, too.
The owner and manager of the new Verb cafe is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe.
He started in verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new cafe, he said that he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
verb order bagels from the same supplier as before and use the same espresso model.
In addition, it even re-established old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says, however, that he also wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
There are bacon-kanan egg-cheese-sandwiches and fills caps and browned onion rings.
There's also dark people's skins on the list.
Coffee is no longer available, but instead juices made of fresh fruit.
After nine months at the café, Rodriguez says that he has noticed that old regular customers began to visit Verb as a steady stream.
"Also many of our old clients got priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the cafe on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he took a walk back to the verb in Williamsburg.
When they shut down, he tells me he's finished the coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he's having coffee again, even though instead of his regular ice coffee on that Sunday, he took a chai show, which is also a list-new one.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been faithfully visiting Verb since 2003.
He used to go to the cafe before work, and without exception, he ordered the same thing.
"I came to the cafe every day at about 15 minutes, like a plane, and there they already made my voibagel with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and bring new products to his menu.
Today Rosentha continues to order her standard product, but sometimes she varies in bacon, egg and cheese fillings of her bagel.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have a grudge that the soap store took the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soap, which is made with Verb’s own cold roasted coffee.
"We may yet take the offer," Rodriguez says.
The Poles, who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint, have also welcomed the café with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is applying for a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell coffee.
The café may also expand into the next building.
However, it is enough for many customers to get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the cafe was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered a coffee there, it felt like coming home, says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of a coffee shop."
The tough food of the great recession in the new work: A Square Metal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as the Culinary Cross, was attracted to the luxurious foods of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the goose liver pasta and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day his menu was more modest: Deviled eggs in tomato sauce, potato muse, and for dessert, plumming.
"It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity for people who suffered," says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe adds, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
A couple in Brooklyn Heights work as a food historian.
Coe's latest book, called Chop Suey, tells about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of a flat in Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work is the A Square Metal published by Harper and published on Tuesday, which describes the history of American food during the great recession of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when agreeing with the supplier Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron cloud collector, and opened in the same year as the great stock market collapse occurred, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe for turkey, potato and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered the meat loaf, the couple said it would fit into a very large discussion on eating the recession.
"The troubles were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanuts, liver problems, and beans.
They were made from substances that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine eating so much peanuts that they're sufficient for the whole meal."
Andrew Coe is making fun of me.
"It must have been pressed in the stomach like lead," he says.
Before the great recession of the American dining table, especially in rural areas, acted on the Buffet principle of "eat as much as you want".
Women made food for farmers, and for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, freshly baked pies were served.
It was the Americans who had sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I. A Square Metal is a chronical of the ways in which the people survived when they suddenly had to give up their abundance.
"This was the time when food became a key and distressing topic for the Americans", says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
A new diet was equally distressing: Ziegelman said that mysterious dishes such as locusts and batteries became the main food, and the pasta was called "a powerful way to take advantage of the food stars" because cooks could cover up less attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
The flesh, which had been the main part of the American meal for years, became a well - used luxury.
Strange mixes were tried, where the most important thing was the fulfillment of calories and nutrients, and not so much the taste or even the sense of a healthy kitchen.
In the course of research into a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared oven onions filled with peanut butter used as a pomegranate.
"It didn't get any popularity at dinner," says Coe.
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and onion are not compatible at all.
This was a feature of many household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, the head of the federal household agency in 1923-1943, guided the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, and encouraged women to be precise budget holders and respond to the challenge of making carrot-creep-like crepes tasty dishes.
The Square Metal book is a celebration of historical flavors.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's reaction to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While publicly praising his childhood with simple food on an Iowa farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a sophisticated lord who he had become.
"He liked continental European cuisine, like fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He ate almost in the golden-coated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the flavor at all, the food served in the White House was not only Washington's most boring, but also the least-prepared."
Many of the food of the recession was abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition is still evident in how we pay attention to calories and food intakes and how science has applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the couple tell us that they began to understand better the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother, such as why she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away," say Coe.
"People even started to feel sick about his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, once from the windshield."
After the main cooking plates had been emptied at Eisenberg’s lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe brought out their home - prepared plum dessert, the same as President Roosevelt ate in his lunch.
"It's called plum foam," says Ziegelman and adds that giving a visible name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream foam, only plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We used to sink our spoons into a thick brown dung.
Suddenly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe's been snooping for the second time, and he's been playing for the third time.
"The German nuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budgeter.

The U.S. Court of Justice ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive full compensation for the legal fees incurred by it in its dispute with Merck & Co Inc, a pharmaceutical manufacturer concerning the patent for hepatitis C.
In June, Gilead was released from the 200 million-dollar damages imposed on it for the infringement of two of Merck's patents in relation to the successes of Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni.
In the application lodged on Thursday, U.S. Regional Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman says that Gilead was entitled to be exempted from the legal fees incurred by it in defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can treat more than 90% of patients with hepatitis C.
This is due to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other and demanded the private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory supervision. Sofosbuvir is an active substance in Gilead medicines.
The troops supported by the United States have taken the city of Manbij from Isis
The troops supported by the United States have been taken over by the city of Manjib, near the Turkish border in northern Syria, when the last extremist Isis fighters left the city, says the army's messenger.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group now grabs the city to find the last Isis fighters hidden in the city.
A representative of the Manbij Military Council of the SDF, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages captured by Isis fighters have been released.
"The city is in full possession now, but we are still conducting search operations," said Darwish.
Clintons earned 10.75 million dollars in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal tax
Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton published his 2015 tax return on Friday, which shows that his and his husband's income at that time was $10.75 million and the actual federal tax rate paid by them was 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charities, mostly the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made almost $5.3 million in speech fees, and former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton announced that he earned 3 million dollars from Simon & Schuster in his book on his term of office at the Foreign Ministry.
Mr Clinton's vice president, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holto released the 10-year tax returns.
The real federal tax rate they paid for 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are still showing a pattern of economic transparency," says Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in her press release.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax information.
As a rule, US presidential candidates have always disclosed their tax information, even though the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax administration's audit and say it's the reason Trump hasn't released his income records.
"The transfer is yours" tweeted by Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, referring to the tax information of the Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Special Legal Assistant to Trump, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to disclose his tax records until the checks were completed.
The critics of Trump, including President of the Republic of 2012 Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump's own capital, his contributions to charity, his business relations and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken a stand on this issue and released a video on Friday, bringing out prominent Republicans who are putting Trump on the line to disclose their tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
"The trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, and does not publish his tax returns," said Clinton to the crowd.
According to the Politico website, Trump did not pay taxes at all or only pay a little from two in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and auditors that the situation could still be similar.
The federal tax rates have become a key issue for the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a billionaire investor named according to Warren Buffett, which would ensure that more than a million dollars per year earn at least 30 % of the tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at the Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose headquarters the Berksshire Hathaway multi-sector company is located in the same place, challenged Trump for a meeting where they would both disclose their tax information.
Buffet says that he has also been subject to the tax administration control and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid a real federal tax of 32% on average between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate they paid was approximately 40.5%.
The Clinton tax return for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was the low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons announced a dividend and interest income of USD 109 000.

Chili powder-filled thong condoms in support of the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Nature conservationists in Tanzania have come up with an unusual way to keep elephants away from the human settlement – elephants are rushed by throwing chili powder-filled condoms at them.
The method has proven effective, and a few years ago, the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the United States’ Nature Conservation, has launched a campaign designed to teach volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania how to protect their homes and cultures without harming their elephants.
Some time ago, spears were used to rush elephants.
Friday is the world's elephant day dedicated to the protection of animals.
"After the method has been developed, we have seen changes in attitudes in these villages, because now the villagers can rely on them to keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them," says Damian Bell, CEO of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, the intruder elephant will be disturbed by pointing a flashlight and playing a horn.
If this doesn't work, we'll throw the so-called chili cloud.
The soil mixed chili powder is placed in a condom together with a hoof, and the head of the condom is then rolled in such a way that only the filament of the ignition is excluded.
When the fuse is lit, the condom explodes and spreads a fine chili powder cloud into the air.
Usually one spice cloud is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last means is a thrower that fires a fireworks known as a Roman candle into the air and produces a loud and bright explosion.
The Jewish film director criticises the Berlin hotel for removing Israel’s heading number from the Arab call – RT News
The French, Jewish film director, who had just given birth to the media, revealed that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel did not mention Israel’s directional number in its country-numbering list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the holocaust Shoah document, depressed his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
In his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find the hotel’s list of directions offered by Israel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which the room is directly accessible.
"How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann's writing.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation about the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's answer was shocking him.
The receptionist said that the removal of Israel from the list was a "the decision carefully considered by the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the procedure was even more shocking to the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said, "The biggest part of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's heading number."
The Israeli German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung said the case was a "great shame".
"The incident shocks and shocks all of us.
It's a big shame.
And the more disgraceful it is when we consider that we are in Germany and this is the very chain of hotels.
That's all we need to explain.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a counter-reaction online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply yielding to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Fear" was said in a publication that revealed the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel has denied the charges quickly, called what happened a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The direct order to leave Israel out of the list of directions was never given," writes the representative of the Hotel Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski.
It adds that the heading number has since been added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to protest Brazilian students.
The students came together with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered together to protest against the government’s reform of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
The riot began when law enforcement authorities tried to break down the student population, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in the demonstration, who wanted to show their stunnedness to the government’s plans.
The Governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed a savings measure involving the closure of almost 100 public schools and the placement of 300 000 students in new schools.
Some of the protestors made graffiti on walls that temporarily opposed Michel Temer, who was in charge of the president’s office.
The protest of students took place only a few days after the streets were filled with the protestors in favour of the separated President Dilma Rousseff when the Senate of the country voted on the charge of office.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased 71% – RT Business
Since the departure of the sanctions, annual trade flows between Moscow and Tehran have increased by 70.9 per cent, says Russian Iranian Ambassador Levan Dzhagarya.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were repealed.
"Russian companies continue existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
The further growth of trade is, of course, one of the priorities for cooperation between countries," says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 % in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to USD 856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5% to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
Trade was accelerated by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says the Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, the Russian foreign representation in Iran issued about 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was for the first time among the first 20 countries with tourists in Russia.
Nor is it too bold to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend travelling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
The Scot Callum Skinner was going after the British when he won the gold on the bike.
The Scottish Callum Skinner challenged the reputation of men in the team print at Rio's Velodrom last night when the British Trio defended London's 2012 championship.
Glasgow's 23-year-old Skinner played an anchor that he inherited from his countryman Sir Chris Hoy, from Scotland. The young man made the legend proud to thank the goal and capture the victory from the New Zealand team, which he considered to be a pre-popular.
Britain took the surprise win four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the pace after being ranked sixth in the World Championships in London in March, despite the fact that Hoy had subsequently left his race career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specialises in the role of the first leader.
Hindes came out at just the right time.
Hoy's decision to end the race also left a hole that Kia Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was the man that the British coachs believed in and saw the potential that he has now redeemed.
Hindes, Hoy and the champion of the championship four years ago, Kenny and Skinner made an Olympic record in the time drive, but in the first round, New Zealand was faster.
And the British Trio won gold in a duel.
Hindes was just behind after his tour, but Kenny was working on the team's lead position, which Skinner maintained.
A large part of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes drove the speed at a higher speed, which enabled Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy followed the BBC as a commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes’ eyes as they entered the award height.
Glasgow's 23-year-old Skinner says, "I'm flattered by parallels.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We did an Olympic record at the final and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win it."
After winning in London in 2012, Hindies, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had fallen on the track on purpose because of a bad departure.
Later, he withdrew his word, and British competitors had no appeal.
This time the sovereign victory did not have such problems.
Hindes says, "The feeling was like in London, all the British flags were in the scene.
Our team was united in the last three months.
We've lost so many world championships that victory at the Olympics feels great."
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten railway yards in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of the progress made over the last five months, then the five days ahead will be successful with velodrome.
As Kenny has demonstrated, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold at the Olympic Games.
This would mean an increase in the account of six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was born on 23 March (the magical date of British sports, including Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday).
I mean, the medal subsidies would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny will be competing next in a sprint that starts today and settles in three days.
A Bolton 28-year-old Kenny says, "At the moment, I can only rejoice about this.
The team race is always the best.
You're gonna have to enjoy the victory with the guys.
Winning alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he has to get the knight's value."
This was the only medal competition today, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were the fastest four-man team race ever.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record that was made in London in 2012 and won gold is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (at 22.42) will be competed today on the second day of the competition, and the focus will certainly be on Wiggins.
Yesterday, he had a dispute with the competition authorities before the time he was driving when he was invited to measure his length.
In a similar competition for women, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached the world record of 4:13.260.
The British team can now count on its great cycling team to take responsibility for the mid-term Olympics and bring a number of medals to the country.
Following the truly exceptional evidence of a complete leadership position in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, the least of which is not the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of claims related to sexism and harassment, and the end of great athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton's competitors.
However, the first night of the Velodrom competitions shows that the already legendary reputation of the United Kingdom to rise to the top at a perfect moment will be achieved once again.
The future of the Portland melting plant at stake due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium melting plant in Portland, Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of employees are at stake when the power plant power company, which provides power, told it that one of its owners is breaking down the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of a decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to continue the aid for the operation of the plant.
Fixed aid granted for 20 years will cease in November.
Alcoan Portland is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
As a result, up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be in danger.
The snowball effect may continue to increase, as the melting plant consumes approximately 10 per cent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry’s melting plant, which resulted in the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's melting plant is losing money and there's a risk of closing its doors.
The measures are in line with the speculations that have been used for years for the future of the plant, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently by the production price of the plant.
The AGL, which supplies electricity to the large aluminium alloy plant from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says that it is also expected that three other melting plant owners will terminate their contracts.
The majority of the plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumina joint venture. The Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares of the factory.
AGL says that it is waiting for the permanent operation of the Portland plant, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue.
AGL reports that the contracts are so-called ‘protection agreements’, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The notice of termination is 12 months and will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects contracts to generate revenue in the financial year 2017," says the power plant.
The potential profit effects on AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong market prospects for the future in terms of wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL already says that it has reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million as a "predictment for termination".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alco's ability to keep the melting plant operational or to secure the supply of electricity to the melting plant".
The American company stated that it had concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force since November of this year, although it still needs to know why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
Due to the weak economic situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious in their assessment of both the melting plant in Portland, Victoria, and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
AGL’s operational director Stephen Mikkelsen earlier in his speech to analysts said that at the annual level Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If these plants leave the market, it means a significant fall in demand (electricity) on the market.
As a producer to us, it wouldn't be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashian reality TV star Kendall as Vogue's cover girl in September
The model belonging to the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the famous issue of the United States Vogue in September.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's ad face and has performed during the fashion weeks of Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the canteen in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The publication of the cover picture was followed by a strange (or perhaps only Kardashianist-series-style?), a scripted video with all the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (barms Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite uncle, the Kardashian-series producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting to forget their sister's cover picture. The video ends in a classic turn: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is a cliché, and it is used in almost every part of the program's birthday periods (Seacrest says: "Did you think we'd forgotten you?" as sincerely as the children's morning TV cartoon character), but Krisin had to get the rest of his daughters involved in this publicity in some way.
The appearance in Vogue’s September issue will undoubtedly mean the new Kardashian era.
Kendall’s big sister Kim may have made it to Vogue’s application before (in addition, he and his husband Kanye West appeared on the cover of Vogue in April 2014), but the issue of September is quite a category.
The September issue is the most sold issue in the year by Vogue.
More of a large picture book of its thickness than a magazine-like issue attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion site from Fashion calculated that last year's 832 page guide contained 615 pages of advertisements).
The cover - letter publication of the September issue is expected to be so intense that in the previous two years the pictures of the magazine have leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Previously, the cover models of September have been Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelil and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the deck has been more famous than models that are famous.
The Oscar winner and Dior commercial face Jennifer Lawrence was cover-up in 2013, and a year later the honour was awarded to Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for his generation, and even though he would rather be among the famous ones who work as a model, he is still in quite a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of known people, real TV stars or modern children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry over others.
Last year's album Beyonce has one of the strongest years of his career, when he published his Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of his true-TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be a mess.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model, Stephanie Seymour, criticised Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, calling them bitches.
These feelings have re-emerged when the news of Jenner's appearance on Vogue's deck came out.
However, the continued dissatisfaction seems to be irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover for Vogue's September issue.
He's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He walks at Marc Jacobs fashion shows.
He's the ad face of Estee Lauder makeup cream.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid applications.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter she shot for the LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, he's on real-time television, maybe just a way to meet his sister and her kids.
Legal Aid Centres turn away 160 000 people a year
Every year, the most vulnerable people in more than 160,000 countries will be turned away from the legal aid centres, and the sector will be preparing for the impact of further cuts in appropriations on centres already operating at extreme borders.
In the Land of Queensland, three of the five people seeking free legal assistance and legal services are already being turned away — most of them are the elderly, immigrants, disadvantaged workers, victims of violence and unsubstantiated evictions and similar injustice without resources.
Public legal assistance services, which are already overburdened, are preparing for additional cuts in appropriations.
Since June next year, the Legal Aid Offices are in danger of losing another 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Queensland Public Aid Centre, reports that according to the latest accounting report prepared by the National Organisation of Legal Aid Centres, thousands of people are being turned away from the Centres every year.
If the federal government doesn't reverse its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland Public Aid Centres are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people will be turned away when they seek the necessary services," says Farrell.
"The people who leave violent relationships, the people under the burden of uncontrollable and ignoble debt, the families who are leaving, the workers who are unwarranted – all have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The Federal Government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to cope with complex legal problems without assistance.
We appeal to the Chancellor of Justice and to the Senator of Queensland, George Brands, so that these financial cuts can be stopped immediately so that people can get the legal assistance they need.
Last year, the state administration fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid financing to the national average level.
Now is the time to take account of the needs of the Public Legal Aid Centres and their clients, and the Palaszczuk Government must invest in this important work."
An action was brought against Donald Trump's campaign to threaten an employee with a gun.
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued when no action of any kind was supposed to be taken after it had been informed that the campaign leader of North Carolina had threatened the employee with a gun while they were driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in an action brought by Vincent Bordini, former software coach of the state campaign at the State Court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
My Bordini says that she waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before she realized, according to her own words, that this would not happen.
My Bordini says in his application that campaign manager Earl Phillip "took out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and put the pipe in Vincent's kneecap."
After submitting a complaint to the local and regional management board, Bordini learned that at least four others had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"Even if you don't fire a gun, it'll cause damage," says my Bordini on her cover.
The action comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a general rage when he said to the crowd in North Carolina that "supervisers of the second paragraph" – including gun owners and gunmen – can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets elected judges.
According to Trump's campaign staff, the media removed his words in the context, and Trump did not encourage violence with his words.
In his application, Bordini claims compensation from the campaign for the indiscretion and for Phillip's assault, assault and the mental suffering they cause.
Hope Hicks, an informant of Trump, did not reply immediately to the request for a comment.
Despite the efforts, Phillip was not reached.
Charlotte's local news agency, WCCB, told me Phillip just left the campaign.
There was no immediate response to the request for a call from Phillip's consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been running a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
The British must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates prosperity – not only in local communities and London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the thing that was most interested in Heathrow. As at the London Olympics in 2012, we made a huge contribution to the benefit of our entire nation and all our regions.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and East End.
We are doing this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we are creating 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
As at the London Olympics in 2012, there are always people who feel that Heathrow's expansion is too much of a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I heard that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will be in an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012 and will also be wrong about Heathrow.
There will always be obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and to increase the economy by GBP 211 billion, bringing knowledge and employment to both the airport environment and the UK as a whole.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which has carried out an infrastructure investment programme of GBP 11 billion in time and by staying in the budget, which included the T5 terminal – voted the best flight terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of the two most congested runways in the world.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway, supported by a private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an expansion of Heathrow.
It is time we used the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the know-how and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Government and former Trade Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook advertising for cat-mouse games
The attempts of companies that earn money from online advertising to mislead advertising prevention software have turned into cat-mouse games, says one company that produces prevention programmes.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it would block the adstensto programs, Adblock Plus published a blog entry where it told users that they could update their anti-lock software filters and thus again block the community service ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it will change the labelling codes of its desktop website in such a way that it is more difficult to identify which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock tells me he's found out the new codes.
In his blog article, Adblock's informant Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of balling between the open-source advertising community and the deceivers has been going on since the anti-advertisement was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repair movement again.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the great concern that advertising players have become in the field.
Globally, it is estimated that 200 million people are using adstensto programs, says a study carried out by Pagefair and Adobe last year.
Facebook is used on mobile devices every day by 1.03 million active users, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenues.
However, the company intends to invest in misleading advertisingtensto programs in its desktop application, as the publicist says that mobile advertising prevention programs do not work on Facebook and Instagram.
The revenue from Desktop advertisements is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered it worthwhile to invest.
On Tuesday, Facebook also told us that it is updating the user settings ad tool so that users can control more about how to target ads.
On Thursday, Facebook criticises Adblock's new filters, as it also prevents some regular Facebook messages from being displayed.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem" said Facebook informant in his e-mail.
"Advertising programmes are clumsy and ineffective, and that is why we have instead invested in the development of user settings such as advertising tools, so that people can control the targeting of advertising themselves."
She committed suicide by leaving cars under the Swiss motorway.
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking for the help of witnesses on the motorway in the first hour of Thursday for an accident in which a woman deliberately left under several cars.
The accident took place on the A1 motorway in the Canton of Vaud near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate work by laying down on the dark road, and several cars hit her, says the Vaud police in their announcement.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and his aim was clearly to commit suicide. Among the over-dried cars there was also a truck.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, and the police are asking them or other witnesses of the accident to sign up.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstitter reports in the Le Tribune de Geneva newspaper that criminal investigations have been launched, which is a logical step in such a situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether the drivers involved in the accident will be prosecuted.
"Is it impossible to avoid a collision?
It's left to the D.A.'s office," says Hofstitter.
There have been two similar cases over the past five years, on the basis of which drivers are not considered responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases the person walked on the dark motorway and the court decided that the drivers could not expect to run into the pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police officer was released from the charge of death following his encounter with a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on one night in August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking a lot of alcohol and passed out.
The Court held that the way of driving a police officer, who was responding to an emergency call, was justified and that the man lying on the road was "an entirely exceptional and unpredictable situation".

NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model for researching Venus' past with the same tools and algorithms as those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether the conditions in Venus could sometimes be similar to those on Earth, even though Venus is hot and anhydrous and its atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide.
According to previous performances of researchers, the slow speed of Venus is explained by its thick atmosphere.
On the basis of the latest simulation, however, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere corresponding to the earth and has nevertheless been running slowly.
The model was also used to find out about the early surface formation of Venus.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent darker.
"In the modeling of the GISS, Venus spins slowly and has a side of the sun almost two months at a time," says GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in the press release.
This warms up the surface and generates rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer works like an umbrella and protects the surface for a large part of the sun's heat.
As a result, the average temperature of the climate is up to a few degrees lower than the current temperature of the Earth.
With the help of the model, Venus’s story, which corresponds to the earlier assumptions of planetary scientists about its development, was created.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and the ultraviolet light burned the steamed water.
As hydrogen ran into space, only a thick carbon dioxide-like gas and a lethal greenhouse effect — that is, Venus as it is today.
Researchers reported on the results of the new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is giving up his position as coach of Avalanche.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as a coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche team, relying on a lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
The Vice President/Chairman of Colorado, Joe Sakic, confirmed the news and announced that the club would immediately start to seek a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have played my role as head coach for the Colorado Avalanche team and as vice president of the club's hockey activities with a strong, passionate and determined mind," says Roy, 50-year-old in his Communication.
"In the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I can improve the team, give it the depth needed and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the Deputy Director-General of the training and association’s hockey activities must be in full line with the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," says Sakic.
"We are grateful for all that he has done for our organization and we wish him well for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the League for his first season as Head Coach of Avalanche in 2013–2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not been able to continue in the past two years.
Avalanche achieved 39-39-4 power points in 2015–2016 and remained five points away from the Wild Wild in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career — two in Montreal Canadiens and two in Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and suspend strike
The main negotiators report the interruption of the North Sea oil workers' wage strikes when all parties to the dispute participate in the new round of negotiations.
Wood Group, which provides oil-field services, has been subject to attacks on drilling boards owned by Royal Dutch Shell in the North Sea.
According to the Joint Declaration of the Parties, "Wood Group and Trade Unions Unite and RMT confirm their agreement to restart the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of next week, we will be holding several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will be dealing with the problems of fresh aspects.
The trade unions justified their recent activity, which according to them was the first in more than 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut its contractors' tariffs in the North Sea by around 9% this year.
The reduction in the company's tariffs is consistent with a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working in countries in 20114.
According to the company, the additional cuts give it the room for manoeuvre necessary to cope with the decline in the market.
On the other hand, Shell has cut down thousands of employees on its payroll and announced its plans to leave oil and gas drilling in up to 10 countries, thereby enhancing its operations after its megafusion with the British energy company BG Group.
The lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June are putting pressure on energy companies.
This week, Mr Dave Anderson, a Scottish Member, met with working leaders to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts experienced in the North Sea for an entire generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the economy of the region.
"In the North Sea and the whole country, we need an economy that benefits many and not just the few," says Anderson.
Under $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea in 2016, with around $7 billion spent on these projects over the last five years.
Kepler is measuring the speed of the stars in the Pleiade star range
The most recent task of Kepler Spaces is to measure the speed of the stars, which has helped the astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of the speeds of the stars of the Pleiadies star range so far.
On the basis of the new data, astronomers will be able to determine why the stars of the same group are spinning at different speeds and how the orbiting times are associated with the planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other constellations we learn more about the relationship between weight and age and even the history of its solar system," says Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Caltech University Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pasadena in the press release.
The star band of the Pleiades is located 445 light years from the earth.
Many of the starry stars were born some 125 million years ago, which means they are about to reach their adult age.
They're spinning faster now than ever.
With the speed of rotation on top of the adult stars, large amounts of the star wind are poured out.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star grows older, its speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by monitoring the time between the appearance of identifiable star spots (corresponding to sunspots).
The most recent listed speed data suggest that the larger stars will run slower than the smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars with dancers – larger ones spin more slowly than smaller ones.
"We see from the "dancing" of the Pleiades that the slow spins are typically larger, while the fastest spins are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Since the Plejad starry is so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory to compare star properties with rotational speeds.
"The group of players provides a support pillar for theoretical models for the rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to learn a lot more about how, when and why the stars slow down their speed and stop their "dancing".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of the speeds of the Pleiades in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
