That was a silly question.

If you'd stop telling me not to get nervous, I'd probably not be so nervous.
That's natural.
What are you doing?
I'll put my passport back in the vault.

That was our biggest problem.
You're very kind.

Tom's gonna starve.
It's not a secret.
I was wrong about that.
Buy me, please.
We're gonna do this together.
Can you help me, please?
She saw Tomi smile.
He's in a hurry to reach the eight-hour train.
He was considered a hero because he saved his friend's life.

Tom said you hate dancing.
If you have time, why don't you go to the gallery?
I was nervous at first, but then gradually calmed down.
I don't want to buy this kind of couch.
You have to ask Tom first.
Explain it to me.
I'm aware of the difficulties.
I'm not sick.
Where are you from, Karen?
It's frozen somewhere in the mountains.
Tom went that way.
Tom poured milk into his cat bowl.
I feel like something terrible is going to happen.

Tom should have done a lot better.
What songs did they sing?
I'm going home to Boston.
Already or not?
Mr. Harrison was sitting on his seatbelt with a lock on his belt, and he was smoking his evening pipe.
I don't feel like studying French today.
Tom's a mess.
Go, but without me.
I was a fool to trust Tomi.
What kind of beer do you have?
That was a secret.
I trust him.
Good luck seeing the stars.
Japan has diplomatic relations with China.
My parents aren't alive anymore.

Any time, you can ask me anything.
I love you.
This isn't your hat, is it?
Tom doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
You can go home now.
It's just an empty threat.
There are two old chestnut trees outside our house.
They were screaming.
The snowflakes fell on her long, blonde hair.
I don't recognize anyone in this picture.
I hope we don't make you uncomfortable.
Let's talk about this outside.
Thomas is studying chemistry.
He keeps his word.
I don't expect any special treatment.
His old friends turned away from him.
Tom didn't put enough sugar in my coffee.
I'm sure I won't pass the exam tomorrow.

I've never seen anything like this in my life.
I'll call Tom right now.
I broke up with my girlfriend.
Hopefully, things will be fine.

I need more space.
Tom taught me most of what I know in French.
Do you want a drink?
He keeps his money at the bank.
I don't care if you believe me.
What do you think these are?
It's hard for everyone to please.
There's a solution.
How much do you think Tom makes?
There's no such thing.
This world is governed by evil forces.
He laughed to hide his fear.
I'm in line.
Can I have a kilo of boned tuna, please?
Don't sound.
The story was real.
The wounded screamed at the pain after the anesthesia was over.
That's what I need.
How much money do you have?
Focus.
They don't talk at all.
Hold your fire!
He's always asking for your opinion.
We use margarine instead of butter.
I'm very pleased with this purchase.

I'm asleep.
He doesn't understand you.
I'll explain.
Tom retired a few years ago.
We're all safe.
It was a smoothie.
Calm down.
They drank two bottles of wine.
Come tomorrow.
Can we try this one?
The table is green.
Tom was supposed to win the race.
I'm the one who needs to be signed.

I'm not coming.
Thank you.

This isn't drinking water.
Did you know them personally?
Tom doesn't look too happy, does he?
Please, speak up.
You need to keep your eyes open.
Tomi has a black cat.
The courage brings forth heroes, and trust brings forth friends.
Once again, he came up with the old story.
Tom bought Mary a box of chocolate.
My destiny is in your hands.
Let's talk about something else.

Let's eat a doughnut.
Tom's intentions weren't clear.
Do you have my book?
Please think about it.
Tom did what he wanted.
I can see the light.
I'm just as guilty as anyone.
You're worse than me.
Don't be mad at me around here.
There's nothing urgent.
Tom won't hurt me.
He's a vegetable salesman.
You can't always win.
It's a silver coin.
I feel helpless.
Goodbye.
I'm fat.
It's 10:00 a.m.
The road is full of canoes.

Just start working.
I'm sure I'm hallucinating.
Tom cleaned Mary's car.
Let's go over it.
You're the most important thing in my life.
But the proposed changes conflicted with each other.

Tom let me go.
Can I have your full name?
Boring.
I care what he says.
I told you this wouldn't work!
Tom gave Mary chocolate.
Don't complain, don't explain.
Here's your boarding card.
I saw one.
What's your profession?

Too bad I'm late.

I'm from Japan.
I saw Dana.
Tom's good for animals.
I didn't register.

You look nervous.
Now we have to stand for him.
Do you really believe in magic?
I don't know exactly where I was born.
I'm afraid of Tomi.
I'm glad we agree on something.
Then the bear ran to the paw, threw down his bear skin and touched him with the wand the witch gave him. In a moment, the skin became a beautiful, moon-lit baller clothing, and the talikska turned into a carriage that was drawn by two dancing parrots.
Don't make a mistake.
Can't you do it now?
He's wasting his time on books.
Is he tall?
I'll wait for Tom.

Is there anything I can do for you?
You know the whole town.
Someone pushed me in.

He was a poor musician.
Animals are our friends.
I don't like surprises like that.
He was a cruel man.
It's an opportunity.
This is Tom's house.
I know you can help us.
I saw him with my own eyes, and I heard him with my own ears.
Can you just excuse us for a second, please?
Which one's your beer?
I won't let them use my Husqvarna chain saw.
In the bathroom all the way to the ceiling, everything was smuggled out.
I'll read the description to get it started.
The silence was complete in the area.
They skied.
Tom has no idea about reality.
Hey, listen to me.
You live with your parents?
I'm not that naive.
I opened the door with it.

Tom's busy.
There are people that can be easily influenced.
I don't understand why I shouldn't do that.

I knew you'd get in trouble.
Tomi has a guest.
I feel sharp chest pain.
I'm willing to risk it.
How can you say that?

I think he's coming.
It's Monday.

Don't worry.
Good-looking people look good, no matter what they wear.
You're comparing apples to pears.
Tom's at the table now.
It's dangerous here.
I can't stand that noise.
It's very nice to meet you.
Tom doesn't trust anyone.
Tomi's rich, but Mari's not.
We should probably go.

I live in New York.
We're out of coffee.
Let's have a beer.
What would you do if your child were like this?
My kids don't lie to me.
I'm not proud of my daughter.
It never ends.
They're both laughing.
I wish you didn't do that now.
I tried to help Tomi.
Your soul is doomed to hell.
I'm fevering and my head hurts, I think I'm gonna be sick.
I'm getting on it.
Put this down.
He's got his love.
He missed a class.
Can you give me that cup?
In my opinion, Twitter is a waste of time.
Come on, touch him.
Tom asked Mary the same question he asked me.
The moon belongs to no one.
We were born for a reason in this world.

I have doubts as to whether it will work.
Let's wash up.
He's not into sports, neither am I.
I have a phone.
Tom went back to the hotel.
Do you have a TV?
What am I supposed to do with Tomi?
I feel better every day.
I feel like a fever.
What do the doctors say?
I forgot his last name.
Please help me.
He didn't say anything.
Why are you apologizing?
Tom's afraid he'll be fooled.
Did you know Tom left home?
He likes trains.
We're home today.
I saw Tomi dancing with another girl.
No one was in the room.

Last night, there was a fire near us.
We better go, Tom.
I think you could all use a little sleep.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't eat that.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
I got on a plane.
Are you home?
Clouds surround the mountain.
That's my problem.
How can I make you understand?
He's in the kitchen.
I should've done that with you.
I probably don't want to eat the same thing again today.
I assume Tamás was right.
Here's my membership card.

I don't want to go.
How could you let Tomi do that?
It didn't hurt.
Tom didn't realize Mari was unhappy.
Who was the first one here today?
I'm sorry, I don't hear you right.
I just need you.
I'd like to say that again.
He's blind to one of his eyes.
I know something else.
I would never have met you.
Are you afraid of rats?
Would you like to stay for a cup of tea?

Think hard.

The plane was delayed by more than two hours.
Where do you live in Turkey?
I didn't understand.
Mari wears earrings.
Do you know where we are?
He kissed me, then he left.
Show us the way.
Place and nap!
We won.
He broke up.
Ask Tomi where Mari is.
This house is big.
I'd go to the movies if I had time.
Why are we whispering?
I won't let that happen.

Let's hope it works.
Answer me, or I'll threaten you.
Where did you get that?

Unfortunately, I was hoping for nothing.
I thought Tom would panic.

God help me, I killed a pregnant mother!
He doesn't need money right now.
Why is it dangerous?
I'm not hungry.

We all know why.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
I learned a lot from his books.
