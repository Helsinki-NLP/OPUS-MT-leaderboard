Victory of right-wing populists in Austria, total 29%
According to the first preliminary findings, the pre-eminent parliamentary elections in Austria have been markedly weakened by the two parties of the Great Coalition so far and a significant strengthening of the populist parties on the right.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, suffered a particularly severe loss.
On the other hand, the President of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Karintia's Governor, Jörg Haider, is preparing to return to national politics.
Based on the preliminary results, the country's strongest party will remain the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8 per cent of votes, but it has lost 5.5 per cent of votes compared to the last 2006 elections.
The ÖVP was even worse, which loses nearly nine per cent of votes by 25.6%.
These are the worst results achieved by both major parties in Austria's post-war history, and, in particular, by the People's Party that led to the pre-elections, the result is literally disastrous.
At the beginning of July, the People's Party had a significant advantage before SPÖ when leaving the ÖVP coalition according to public opinion polls.
However, the voters apparently punished him for letting the government fail.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations have already been made about the possible resignation of party leader Wilhelm Molterer and current beginner.
Observers believe that this could be done on Monday at the extraordinary party meeting.
This development is likely to make it easier for the election result to renew the path, i.e. the SPÖ and the ÖVP major coalition.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) had previously obtained 18 percent of the votes and the BZÖ has obtained 11 percent of the votes - however, the Social Democrats expressed their fear of the repetition of 1999 when the People's Party agreed with the populists (the FPÖ was still united at the time, it was replaced by the BZÖ in 2005), which even imposed sanctions on the European Union.
Haider, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party, and I assume that he can return to Vienna for national policy, obviously expects this solution.
The Green Party has also entered Parliament, which has lost some popularity, and has fallen from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties crossed the four-percent limit and did not enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations may cool down
If the problem of Czech scientists reporting for illegal bug collection could not be solved, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain chill in Czech-Indian relations could occur.
This was published by the Minister in New York after his meeting with Pranab Mukherji, his Indian partner today.
"If this were not resolved, yes, a certain chill would occur," he concluded after the meeting, which was inspired by the Czech Republic.
After the trial, Mukherji told me that executive power could be difficult to intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, which has been dismissed from the charge and has been fined, the central government may negotiate with the local leadership of Darjeel, whose law is the subject of the case.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
However, according to Mukherji, for Emil Kučera who was sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Then you could apply for bail and wait for the verdict to be released, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had similarly expressed himself during the trial.
"He offered to appeal to the Supreme Court, so it would be possible to dismiss him," said the Chief of Czech Diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech party could intervene in the whole case is to give the prisoner "competent legal support", the Indian minister mentioned.
At the same time, he told us that the Indian party has already provided them with such help.
"Our main interest is to maintain the best relations with India with its many years of tradition.
This is recognised by the Indians," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"In fact, we consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a serious mistake," he declared.
The question was whether the Indian party had promised to deal with the case was not answered by the Minister.
"I've already made quite a lot of promises," he noted.
Czech judges in the battle for the bottom of the sea
It enters the wall’s electronic map, on which Australia and neighbouring sea areas are visible.
However, the continent is not interested, but is an important point in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and the adjacent seabed along with it.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member working group of the United Nations Division of the Ocean and Maritime Law.
Chief Mikulka, Czech lawyer Václav, director of the Division, monitors the explanation, which is sometimes supplemented.
Work and enthusiasm prevail here.
The seabed is rich in natural resources, barely known so far.
Oil, ore and other minerals can be found here, but also unknown living organisms, which can be the key to developing an anticancer medicine, for example.
Seabed greater than dry land
Coastal states are currently in intensive search for new underwater areas.
According to the United Nations Convention, their rights are enforced, which was agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is primarily an area of the so-called continental plain, often up to a few hundred kilometres from the coasts of that country.
Such a country has the exclusive right under the Convention to all sources of the continental base.
"Simplified, we keep that part of the seabed and the lower layer of the continental base, which is the natural continuation of the underground continent.
The coastal sea borders, often two hundred nautical miles, extend beyond the economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by that country to the Commission to designate the external borders of the Continental Station should be supplemented by a number of extensive scientific and technical documentation based on costly research and measurement.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the committee.
The Committee has so far discussed five applications: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have succeeded," Mikulka adds.
Australia has recently been a success in the world, which has first significantly expanded its underwater country.
But New Zealand has also won - the seabed area for the committee is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is six times the size of the country.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits from the future use of the seabed will, they hope, be invaluable.
Other countries continue to submit their applications.
They can do so within ten years of the moment of ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental base ends, the ocean floor area declared by the Convention to be a common heritage of humanity begins.
No country has an exclusive situation here.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not Klondike", says exaggerated Director Mikulka by saying that "some areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is laid down in a contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now part of the Czech Republic.
He shares this former Eastern bloc with other countries within the common "Interceanmetal" organization.
This organisation received a status under the Convention in 1991, similar to that of investors in some other countries.
He was entitled to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati in the Pacific.
The area examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
It's a copy of the Tatra under the sea.
"A total of 75,000 square kilometers can be extracted.
The area is rich in nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese polymetal ores," says another lawyer, the Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a member of the division's Macedonian staff, is setting another example of concretion.
It reminds me of a potato, or a parchment with a little imagination, with the magic words of Golem.
German special forces were present during the hostage release
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help to resolve the hostage crisis - and the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
The release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt is becoming increasingly evident.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, special German forces indirectly participated in the rescue.
According to this, in addition to the experts of the German Federal Army, GSG 9, the Federal Police flight, and the Federal Crime Bureau, as well as the logistics experts of the German Technical Service, were also on release site.
However, according to the information provided by the minister’s spokespersons on Monday evening, the German forces were not necessary, as the hostages allowed their prisoners to run and then fled when they recognized the signs of violent hostages.
The assistance offered by Germany was accepted by the Egyptian Government in order to involve it as an on-the-spot support force.
"This was luckily not done," said the spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts in the south of Egypt on 19 September.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were dragged to and from Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages has so far remained unclear, as well as details of the release of the hostages or possible ransom payments.
The refugees arrived safely in Cairo in the meantime.
Steinmeier said that the released hostages were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
For the time being, they have not provided any information as to when they will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, five tourists and special forces arrive in Germany on the Airbus aircraft of the German Air Force on Tuesday.
The U.S. House rejects the rescue package.
The lower house of the U.S. Congress failed the $700 billion rescue package proposed for the financial markets by a small majority.
Dow Jones fell into the deep.
The U.S. Chamber of Representatives, with 227 votes against 206, rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite the calls of President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both parties, the programme aimed at curbing the chaos in the financial markets has not received a majority.
The supporters desperately tried to convince the critics of the need for a $700 billion package during a dramatic operation.
Barney Frank, one of the negotiating leaders of the Democratic Party, called for the support of Members, even if the plan is still unpopular.
"It is difficult to obtain political support to avoid something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
Dow Jones has fallen more than 6 percent and 600 points during the vote.
The investors were concerned that the state rescue package could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote so that it would fall again after failure to become public.
Experts are also looking at further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Directors register more and more reservations.
Good winter promises for the German tour operators.
According to one study, the traffic for the next few months increased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak cyclical outlook, the Germans’ travel mood was not depressed.
In the winter season bookings, travel agencies recorded an increase of 31 percent compared to the previous year's period, the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GFK Market Research Institute, the number of bookings for the autumn is higher.
The turnover of travel agencies in October was roughly 11 percent above October 2007, reported by the DRV.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates it to the entire market.
The Institute took into account the travels booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travels to the United States in particular have been sought - reported by the DRV.
Here, the number of reservations increased by about one third.
The Germans are especially popular with their destinations in Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as their domestic landscapes.
Mostly organized roads were looking for - said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
Due to rising energy and food costs, the cost of organised journeys is "better for passengers than for individually organised journeys."
Passengers can save money with, among other things, booking discounts or all inclusive offers,” added Laepple.
The booking rate for the summer months was also very good, so it will be possible to record a further increase in traffic compared to the previous year, although another study shows that fewer German tourists have undertaken trips compared to the previous year.
My first october paint
Uninterruptedly repeated ballermann hits, liters of pottery and design with dirndlit celebrities.
Debut on Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I are not exactly alike.
He's a blonde, TV show manager, and he's wearing a customized dirnt.
My hair is dark, I'm a student girl, and I bought my clothes in the fur.
But one thing connects us: We've only been on Wiesnen for three minutes, we've already been rushed by photographers and loaded their memory cards - very flattered, and all this on my first visit to Wiesnen.
That's how we make friends.
It seems that the cheap dirndli is in line with its purpose.
As a tourist of Wiesn, who lives north of the white sausage, my comfort space is still bordering.
But when you get to Theresienwies, it's not that bad anymore.
Almost everyone wears dirns or leather pants; no one looks at you smiling or awkwardly - everything is fine.
Strange looks at the chocolate stand, just my dirndli apron.
A woman in Munich reminds me that I mistook the apron: "You're free, in the middle, virgin, sold right, widowed in the back."
I secretly moved the bow from back to left.
"That's good," he says, and laughs.
Others work less on the fine flirting techniques and wear a simple filter base with "I'm too drunk to get dressed" and unsolicitedly show their naked butts.
The young man with exhibitionist traits is called Bob, and he also visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
What you find very fantastic is a long stretch of "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
You're gonna tell me all this after you get rid of the contents of your former drinker.
Right next to one of the fire escapes that everyone thinks is a dumpster.
So Bob is one of the famous "no-weeders."
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, the ambulances will go all the way through the scene and take care of the poor couple.
Nurses always appear on a team - four carry a covered stretcher from tent to tent at the same time.
It works like most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure plugged.
Who's lying under the tarts of alcohol, it doesn't seem.
"These are the ones who are completely ready," shouts to me one of the sanitizers on my question, and then in the film.
The police named the victim of the accident
The police named the 63-year-old lady who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
The Brentwood resident, Chelmsford Road resident, Carole Paulson, had an accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road, in the city.
She was moved to a hospital called Queen's Hospital in Romford, but she died later.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with suspicion of reckless driving.
He's been released for bail ever since.
Turkey's broader diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey was intending to join the European Union, the European powers were burned out of the desire to enter deep into the Turkish back country.
On the east side of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, is one of the greatest relics of the failed empire.
The Hydrapasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a neorenaissance style.
At least that's what the travel manuals write.
The building is surrounded by the end of the platforms, one tower at each front corner, and it looks like some German rural town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little down.
However, in view of the interior of the shop’s ticket office, it is clear how large a company had the most western gate.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the 'forward future' of conquests through Damascus through Baghdad, was determined to achieve its ambitions for the occupation of the Middle East by means of today's train to Saudi Arabia.
The German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
The railway lines were attacked by Lawrence and the Arab partisans.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The British colonial army left Egypt and forced the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The Hydepasha station didn't go any better.
In 1917, a ammunition transport train exploded and destroyed the building's beautifully designed top.
According to Turkish sources, sabotage action has taken place.
Since then, it's been falling apart, and history has gone far beyond it.
At the same time today, like the Anatoly and the gate of the railway to the entire eastern region - at least in a symbolic sense - serves as Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon.
The Justice and Development Party in the government - the ACP - has developed a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is remarkable that the Turkish Government maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, the Hamas and Fatah Palestinian groups, Iraq, Iran and, of course, the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded the night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish MP, Suat Kinikliglu.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of bout, which gave me the rhythm of the famous documentary "The Night Mail" about the old world, I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is dedicated to the symbol of the new world state, which turns its back on the past.
However, the ACP with well-known Islamic roots represents a paradigm change in the Turkish consensus.
This has created some suspicions in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern building made of stone and steel, specifically for this purpose - which is located in a developing suburban district, between semi-finished shopping malls and coffee houses. In the latter, the suited middle managers - both men and women - meet early in the morning to do business.
Suat Kinikliglu would have become a right-centred politician in any other European country.
He wore a suit, a tie, and I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The party's foreign policy objective is to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment.
The Cold War has upset the order," he said.
Turkey is isolated from its country of origin.
Today he had to turn east and west at the same time.
He couldn't choose between the two.
He had to open it in both directions.
"But is it possible that he'll eventually be forced to choose?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted to get in the way."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here has repeated almost mechanically: Turkey's relations with the Middle East and with the Caucasus and the countries around the Black Sea are also of the same benefit to Europe and the United States as Turkey itself.
It is as if they were trying to convey the message that, in a spirit of transfer, together with Turkey, all of Europe can reach Asia and the Middle East on those lines to the east.
When I was back at the Hydrapasha station, after another night, mostly awake, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who watched the reconstruction of this beautiful building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that the ambitions of Europe in the Middle East are now largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I waited for the ferry to take me back to the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was then called "the sick man of Europe".
At least at that time, there was no question of which part of the land would claim this exciting country.
Memorial Lifeways: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, Guildford's musical director, Vernon "Tod" Handley (Nekrolog, Sep. 11) led Guildford's Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Based on his music plans for the part of the city, he founded Proteus his wonderful youth choir the following year.
In principle, only those under 21 could have belonged to the band, but when Proteus sang his finale in 1979 - many of us were at the end of our 20s - we simply refused to separate from the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shapeshifter) was in line with the determination and ability of the choir to cope with any music they put before - be it the Madrigal or a Messiah piece; without escort or great orchestral escort.
The diversity of music in such a young choir was often astounding and always exciting, and it was due to the man whose inspiration for music remained unchanged over the years.
How often did Todd tell us to "let the music go on its own."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the bag.
So sing it."
The framester's technique was always perfectly understandable and accurate, but never dictatoric or excessive.
Whatever the musical standard, he always raised me.
John Frayn Turner wrote about him:
If he ever lived as a conductor who should've been turned into a knight, that was Vernon Handley.
I was well acquainted with the two decades during which he led the Guildford Philharmonics from 1962 to 1982.
In the past forty-six years, I wrote criticisms about his over 100 concerts, but he never disappointeds me with one and often inspires me with them.
Tod Handley had the greatness and humility together, which is very rare.
He hated those conductors who, in his words, simply "galoped with a few well-known battles all over the world."
A lot of us are gonna miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your necrologue William Woodruff (September 25), "in 1946 he continued his economic history studies in Oxford, and in 1950 he became a scholarship student at the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while he was constantly preparing for his basic diploma, master's degree and PhD title."
It's from the authors' notes of Woodruff's work "Beyond Nab End", but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and, under the leadership of Professor J.D. Chambers, completed his PhD examination of the British rubber industry, which he then published in 1958 under the title "The British Rubber Industry".
In 1950-51, he was indeed in the USA with a Houblon-Norman scholarship and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
He left Nottingham in 1953 for good and moved to Illinois.
There's no way to know why Woodruff's decorating this period of his career.
J. Vicente Resino on the Wise Arm
I recommend the exhibition "J. Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Living" because his black-and-white, documentary-style photographs are impressive.
Their simplicity and strength, as well as their respect for the people in the photographs, have attracted my attention.
This exhibition is going through emotion.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second sales record at Honda
In November, Honda will start marketing second-generation Jazz.
True, his predecessor had enough passenger space, but the design of the new model's internal area is even more extensive.
This is combined with sophisticated mechanics, which makes driving more comfortable and increases fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
That's how the second generation Honda Jazz looks.
Although it is very similar to his predecessor in the new Jazz, many internal changes were made.
These include innovative design, new bodywork, larger sizes and new mechanics.
But before we move on to a detailed description of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz appeared six years after the first generation was put on the market.
So first of all, we can say that Honda managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other producers.
While Jazz is less known in Europe, it sets sales records in other markets.
Such a market, for example, Japan, where Jazz was the most sought-after car brand in 2002 and this year.
In Japan, for example, nearly a million pieces of Jazz have been sold since their entry into the market.
The second market was the Old continent, with nearly half a million examples sold in six years.
However, Honda wants to further increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
In other words, the Japanese company marketed a total of 83.000 Jazz in 2007, with estimates for the sale of 100,000 cars in 2009, which would result in an increase of 17% on the European market.
On the Spanish market since 2002, Honda has sold 8000 pieces of Jazz, representing 6,7% of Honda’s total turnover in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary calculate with 2000 examples sold during a year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly mitigate the decline in Honda's traffic in Spain.
For the company's representatives predict 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which represents a reduction of 16% of the 2007 data.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% last year, compared to 1.6% last year.
I would also like to increase this rate to 2% by 2010.
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model.
This would be the Discovery, a five - door and compact - sized - 4370 mm long - hybrid, of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 copies annually worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the market share of the Insight market would be made up by the United States, while the remaining share would be distributed between the Old Continental and Japan.
The launch of the Discovery trade will take place in the first months of the year after the official whale show scheduled for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz became more extensive in every respect.
Its length is equal to 3900 mm (five centimeters longer), its width is 1690 mm (two centimeters wider) and its distance is increased by five centimeters, i.e. 2500 mm.
However, its height remains 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger compartment has become larger.
The larger interior is guaranteed by the new body and the fuel tank located in the middle - this solution can be known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the full cargo hold of the so - called double floor trunk has increased, currently having a capacity of 399 litres, or 19 litres, of the first generation.
Although this includes that these dimensions apply to the type with the 1.4 engine, the 1.2 Honda Jazz trunk is 379 litres.
Some external changes can also be detected, such as easier access to rear-end lamps or optional panorama and rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors belonging to the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, compared to the first Jazz 67 degree opening angle.
The second generation Jazz engines are new.
At the beginning of its circulation, this small model can be ordered with two engines of 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Thanks to the i-VTEC technology, the consumption of both resources is more favourable than the previous model and is characterised by lower CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical co-ordination, while the engine delivers outstanding performance in all respects.
The power of the 1.2 liter resource is 90 horsepower at a speed of 6000 and the maximum torque is 114 Nm at 4900.
This engine, which was 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 litres and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
And the other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100-pound 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 litres and its emissions are 128 grams of CO2.
The colliding car
To develop accident prevention technologies, Nissan is this time a new invention of inspiration from nature, from the world of bees.
The Japanese company designed a robot that's mimicking the bees by avoiding accidents.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step in developing impact prevention technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Engineering Centre built this small robot in Japan in cooperation with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhhiro Doi, Director of Technology PR and Research Development, BR23C is a further extension of Nissan's four-level safety cover.
The robot improves the ability of the company's products to avoid collisions.
While flying, each bee develops its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to Nissan's safety cover.
However, the role of the complex eye of the bee is more important than that with which it sees in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees. Consequently, it can fly uninterruptedly in its own personal space.
To copy the complex eye function, engineers designed a so-called Laser Range Finder (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument shall identify the obstacles within a distance of up to 2 metres at a distance of 180 degrees in front of BR23C, calculate their distance and send a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which shall immediately be converted into a collision avoidance operation.
"As the obstacle occurs, the small robot immediately changes direction by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid impact.
The system is mostly distinguished from the instruments currently available, in which case the avoided manoeuvre will take place completely automatically.
If not, the robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
By way of derogation from bees, the avoiding manoeuvre shall not be directed upwards or downwards, nor shall it move vertically, only in two dimensions, and only in the direction of the turnability of the wheels, i.e. not infinitely, as is the case with bees.
Therefore, in addition to speeding and deceleration, Nissan has also used a rotational function in the robot to avoid collisions.
"This structure only needs to process and respond to data every few seconds.
There is no need for data storage or intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvrings, so only a few dozen KBs can operate without interruption.
It may sound surprising, but it's really not gigabyte, but we're not even talking about megabyte-sized memory.
This is the first step towards the development of an immediate impact prevention technology that, based on Nissan's estimates, can be involved in serial vehicles within 10 years.
The robot operates with lithium-polymer batteries, which are easier and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system may be an additional opportunity to get the driver to the end by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of Mortgage
We have to admit that the US Treasury Department has a lot of money to invest, and they have no common sense.
Because of the crisis and the fact that the Americans do not question the escalators of bank accounts with high solvency, they have created a fun and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
It's "The Hotel of Bad Loans"... that's the Galliba.
The image of the accommodation and, in particular, the reception boasts that we should consider once again, twice, and more three times, really just now is the time to take credit.
And especially where we need credit, because that's probably what it's all about.
The information available on this website is really useful, but it is little detailed.
It's more about teenagers than the general public.
But what would happen if we were to complete the game?
For example, the hotel would have a room of our dreams.
Actually, it's something, because we can't even dream about buying a place...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that it would provide equity to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay $9 billion for 21% of the company’s capital after the Morgan Stanley stock exchange has fallen on the stock market.
One week after the publication of the preliminary agreement, the two banks said that MUFG would purchase 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, i.e. a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price is more than 19% below the book value of the securities on 31 August.
MUFG invests another $6 billion in transferable securities, which provide a 10% return and an exchange rate of $31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is carried out on the basis of an average rate of $29, which is 28% higher than the current rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock price fell by 6.79% at around 17 o'clock in the middle of the greenwichi period, ending at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to speed up the transformation into a banking holding company," explains John Mack, CEO of the US Group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week to diversify its activities while being controlled by the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even more caution from the company giants on Wall Street.
The conditions announced on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that he would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought that the stock would consist entirely of stock shares," explained Toshiide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
"However, due to the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and eliminate the potential risks."
With regard to the weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return on one share is reduced by approximately 20%.
The agreement allows MUFG to convert half of its priority shares into ordinary shares in one year if the trading rate of the latter exceeds the exchange rate by more than 50% over a given period, i.e. around USD 47.
Morgan Stanley will thus ensure that the funds from the MUFG can make use of its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquid resources.
However, the group spokesperson did not wish to provide precise information on the two new allies' strategic plans.
After MUFG's association, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase Tier I solvency rates by about 15%, which will make one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan stated that his balance sheet has improved since the end of August.
Over the past few weeks, the group has been faced with a great challenge, since the stock price has dropped half, while the cost of insurance against default risk has gone to the sky.
This cost was reduced on Monday, but remained high at around 12%.
One more of the big investor banks left behind was Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy and the purchase of Merrill Lynch. This Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that it reached $15 billion: part of it came from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa Monday's statement, Quito
The reconstruction of the Republic in the spirit of the 21st century socialism.
It's a common plan for Hugo Chavez, Bolivian Evo Morales, and Ecuador Correa, Ecuador.
Following a sample of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa explained his ideas about the new constitution on Sunday.
He successfully accomplished his mission, as 64% of the voters voted in favour of the referendum according to official results, which concerned 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted 'no', 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% of the votes were passed by the voters.
To adopt the draft Constitution, 50% + 1 vote was needed.
On Sunday, two polls at the exit of the voting offices and a countdown by a civil society organisation both proved the huge number of 'yes' votes with a 63% and 70% rate.
By the way, Rafael Correa was already talking about the victory of his draft constitution on a Sunday to Monday night.
"The Constitution has won a devastating victory," he declared, and he thanked the people of Ecuador for his position in Guayaquil, south-west of Quito, in the governor's seat, 280 kilometers south-west.
As the well-known President of Chile, Rafael Correa, Chávez, Morales and Chilean president, Michele Bachelet, congratulated.
According to a report by the Organization of the United States of America (OAS) observation mission, the vote took place in a calm atmosphere.The main topic was a 444-point text summarising the principles of "new socialism" protected by the president.
The proposed Constitution empowers the State to serve the economy, while maintaining the right to "design development" for a country which essentially lives in oil extraction by foreign companies and in foreign currency sent by migrants.
The draft Constitution for Correa, which was elected in 2006, also confirms the power of the Head of State, who can obtain a mandate for a maximum of two consecutive periods and has the right to withdraw Parliament.
Correa has already announced that she wishes to use this opportunity and will compete again in February 2009 for the Prime Minister's mandate.
The Constitution also included the free provision of health services and education. The President has already started to introduce this in his country, which has 13.9 million inhabitants and half the population lives below the minimum.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign teams in the country, which could terminate the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of the U.S. drug-related facility.
Released 19 hostages in Chad
Egyptian commando hit the kidnappers, who hostage eleven tourists and eight of their escorts ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were held in the desert for ten days, from which they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released during the morning by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
They arrived at the Al-Maza military base, which is directly linked to the Cairo International Airport, in good condition, at around 4:30 in the afternoon.
The hostages were forbidden to make a statement to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in Maadi, a suburb of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and the kidnappers are "not paid a ransom" - said Zoheir Garanna, Egyptian Minister of Tourism at the airport.
The hostages were imprisoned on September 19 at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border regions of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they participated in safarin. The group was then dragged from 35 unknown hostages to one hiding place.
The group had 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman) and eight Egyptians: two travel guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the safarite travel agency Agyptius.
According to information from an Egyptian security manager, a 30-member Special Commandant arrived on two helicopters on the scene, where they were ambushed on the hostages just before the flood.
Half the kidnappers were killed, the others fled," said the leader who requested his name to be silenced.
He also said that a total of 150 special teams were deployed from the Egyptian Flash Brigade to Sudan, where German and Italian commandos were added.
The Italian Head of Diplomatics in Belgrade, Franco Frattini, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We must recognise that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our secret service people and action groups," he said without further details.
In addition, he denied that the hostages would have been paid a ransom.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army announced that during patrols an off-road vehicle had been arrested by the kidnappers. Six of them were killed (including the Chadian leader) and two were arrested.
According to the military, the hostages were associated with a rebel organisation in Darfur, the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately denied by the relevant organisation.
Lettres - "the silent majority" of culture
The focus of the newspaper news and the election campaign is currently on the issue of funding culture.
That's the only thing we're happy about.
But they're still forgetting a piece of our cultural life.
Who will raise his word to illustrate the ridiculous amounts of small museums, archives, archaeological digs and national historical monuments on the edge of hunger?
What politician is it to remind the federal government that he does not care about the monuments and the buildings that are part of the cultural heritage?
Or is it that there are no laws in either Quebec or Canada that really ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government only contributed EUR three and a half million to the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
The constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture, and that this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, all elected representatives and all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Quebec, 211 companies with history, cultural heritage, archives and genetics work on research in history and the preservation of a large number of private archives and archaeological findings, with a minimum budget.
Often these organizations defend our heritage with their teeth and nails and protest with the last power of the suffocating, when real estate developers and decision-makers direct their bulldozers towards our old buildings and forgotten cemeterys.
When will someone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Statement of part of Fortis Bank by the Benelux Governments
By partial nationalisation, the Benelux countries are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank in trouble, as a first European, due to the spillover of the American credit market crisis: the three countries are supporting the Hungarian financial and insurance institution with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Governments agreed at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s competition officer.
In the euro area, the Fortis Bank is the first major crisis in the context of the international financial market crisis that has been ringing for more than a year, and the decisions taken by the Bank in this regard can therefore be considered to be of some precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, almost half of all three states (49 percent) buy up the bank’s existing property.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including, in particular, the activities purchased from the Dutch ABN Amro last year, mainly insurance.
Fortis's shares started to fall steeply last week, and in the second half of the week there were serious crises at the Institute.
However, the analysts agree that the bank, with its 85 000 employees, is too large to let it go bankrupt.
The company's paperwork only dropped by about 12 percent on Friday, 14-year-olds.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the total market value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but this is not realistic according to the corporate directors.
In addition, the management has accused overseas market uncertainty regarding the adoption of the $700 billion US Package Plan of Fortis shares.
The papers were slightly up on Monday.
On Friday, Philip Dierckx appointed a new CEO for the bank.
The financial institution has also been looking for private buyers, but no one has signed up with a substantial offer.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry, do not lose their money.
The bank's clients have not been panicking so far, and the accounts have not been rushed.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate account and also purchased leasing companies.
fox in the hen
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with the applicant on the basis of human drug purchase data.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme linking the use of prescription data to the consent of the person concerned.
This has to be in independent hands, otherwise we'll leave the fox to the hen", cite Richard Dick, the developer of the drug prescription program in Washington Post.
Insurance companies rely on the health status of the client applying for the insurance premium and the amount to be incurred in the event of the damage, and if they consider the risk to be too high, they do not sign up to it.
In the past, the person was sent to medical examination and the contract was concluded only in the light of the outcome of the examination.
Dick has developed a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: he easily acquires from the pharmacy the kind of medicine he bought in the last year and a half, and the program itself concludes on the kind of disease he suffers and the condition he is in.
For example, when you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol suppressant, it suggests that your blood fat levels are practically unmanageable, which is now classified as a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the programme on the market, some of which also define a risk factor, so the insurer has little to do outside the paperwork, although small difficulties arise.
Adverse effects include that some medicines may be used for several purposes, such as for example, some compounds may be used against migraines or heat waves, but they may also be effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-raising factor for business insurers, not the former.
Special companies were formed to request and process the data, and before they obtain the necessary information from the pharmacy, they request the patient’s consent.
They are now obliged to do so by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure.
Some companies also process the results of laboratory tests and link them to drug consumption data so that they can provide a more accurate picture of the patient’s health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and it will be increasingly difficult to control the use at the same time.
There is a separate law on health protection but only applies to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
Before Congress, there is a bill that also gives the authorities control over companies specialising in the provision of data.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough: he has therefore improved his programme, which would link the transmission of data to the express consent of the data subject.
The other question is that the person concerned may not deny the consent, otherwise the insurers will not enter into a contract with him.
So the hens are, in some ways, referring to the good will of the fox.
Global Marseille menu
Doubles trade with the European Union and India
As mutually leading trading partners of the European Union and India, the agenda of the ninth summit has also been dominated by this issue, alongside the rest of the global problem.
There will also be a French-Indian summit today, where nuclear energy cooperation will be the main issue.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given greater say in international affairs, Member States have not yet managed to reach a common denominator to support New Delhi's permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This issue was thus not challenged at the 9th summit held in Marseille yesterday.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President of the Union, and the Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana, have accepted the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has also agreed to double the trade turnover in five years, i.e. to an amount of EUR 100 billion.
Given that trade increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an excessively ambitious objective.
In this respect, in a legal sense, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been brought together, i.e. air traffic may continue to fly in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the settlement.
The aim is to balance the fact that, while the EU is India's number one trading partner, Újdelhi is only the ninth in the EU's list of partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism - the latter was condemned in all its forms and called for the UN Conference to be convened.
They also called for the end of the Doha trade round, although both of them have a large share of the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
This is what India agreed on, as is with the need for a global deal at the climate conference due next year, and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
I would also like to prevent the rise in food prices and support the international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is going to the French capital today, where he is preparing to deal in a bilateral meeting on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they are confident that French companies will receive a 20 billion euro order for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports, the agreement would last for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
The Italian publishers represent themselves in a strong field at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the most important international copyright meeting in the 60th Buchmasse Fair.
This year's Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits 7 000 exhibitors from 101 countries in a 171.790 square-metre area, where more than 403,000 books will be presented.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian Government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of Culture and Activities: Italy will take a 264 m2 exhibition area through the establishment of a single Italian Point.
The ceremony opening will be followed by a press conference at Buchmasse 5.0's "Room Structure" room, where information, trends and prospects on the situation of Italian books will also be presented.
According to data, the proportion of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is constantly decreasing, particularly in the field of adult and youth publications.
They found the billionaire, Steve Fossett, who disappeared a year ago.
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett's plane, who disappeared on September 3, 2007 over the Nevadan desert.
The wreckage was found on a three - foot - high - level track near Mammoth Lakes, in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the aircraft.
John Anderson, sheriff of the Madera County, has removed all the doubts that still exist: "After determining the position of the plane, we have sent out a team, and now we can be sure that this is about the plane that Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found either in the aircraft or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The US Transport Safety Agency (NTSB) stated that a few hours after the crash was discovered, an investigation committee was asked to identify the machine and to establish that it was indeed the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on 3 September 2007, the day Fossett took a three-hour flight from Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found Fossett's personal belongings near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two IDs for Fosset issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Control, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has set up a number of peaks that have allowed him to enter history.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he first managed to fly around the ground with a balloon: two weeks of lonely flying.
Three years later, he was flying around without landing.
Among his many records are the flight over the Andes, at 15.445 feet [15.445 m], which he carried out with a copilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
An unusual, yet original and firm-shaped hobby jet with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few words, it is the latest "compact off-road vehicle" of Mercedes-Benz, which the German car factory tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
This is why the launch campaign of SUV GLK in Mercedes-Benz from 17 October will be surprising and unusual because of its different content.
The promotional campaign accompanying the introduction of the new vehicle is an unknown media communication tool, including utopian 3D posters that have not yet been used by the car brand in Italy.
The giant poster operation, consisting of three stages, will rule the central shopping street of Milan by 15 November, the Corso Como.
The first phase of this new type of media communication starts with the spatial presentation of the car, with the help of the new SUV, special glasses distributed around Corso Como, almost in real size and in three-dimensional form.
The viewer will feel like the car is coming out of the poster.
Then, through the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK becomes visible in one single way and then becomes a single one.
Without a doubt, with this promotion Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the automotive stereotype advertising world.
Is this a way to arouse future customers' interest?
Let's show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
They're probably out of orbit.
But who is this 150-200 boys and girls, who are now ashamed of the whole of Italy? Members of the group "Ultras Italia", who have been following the selection for years, and which, in truth, has not caused too much trouble so far.
I've never been hit by opponents.
The seed of the group is right-wing.
The main organizers are from Trivento.
Also Verona, Padova, Trest and Udine.
These were joined in Sofia by smaller scattered groups from Campania and Puglia (in fact, only a few units).
Italian flags were floated, displaying the hometown of the fans: on Saturday they were removed so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi cheerleading team called Levski's Drunkers.
The Italian Football Association has made 144 tickets available to Italian fans. They were named tickets, making it easier to control the cheerleading team.
The Ministry of the Interior also checked everyone out: there was no one among those preparing for Sofia who would be in the process, no one who would have been banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans with a record of football were denied a ticket and a trip.
At present, the Ministry of Home Affairs is waiting for protocols from the Sofia police, and then takes the necessary measures: those who have been arrested or identified during the riots can be banned for five years.
It is an international ban, which applies not only to the visit of all the Italian and European stadiums.
So our football hooligans can't get their feet on any football field.
Lucky for you.
However, we must also fear that the hooligans will find followers, that is, that few hundred and fifty people will join others.
"At the same time, we must stop this fire, we must not apologize to anyone who behaves like this," said the Ministry of the Interior.
So we better keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesday's selected match is coming up in Lecce.
In Puglia there is a small cell that supports Italian ultrates.
Tomorrow, the Monitoring Service will meet, and Tuesday, the Security of Sport Events Committee, which can count on a section of the Homeland Security Service, for secret services dealing with support behavior.
"Duce-Duce's scandal and swinging arm under the Italian hymn?
This thought was expressed in a rather unfortunate way, Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago for the Ministry of the Interior's observatory service (the post was occupied by Francesco Tagliente and before Felice Ferlizzi).
Before that, Mazzilli was the chief police chief of the Triest, the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli says is true is not forbidden in Bulgaria to feed the Ducé, but the behaviour of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
I'm not a sociologist, he's been assigned to him by the first man of the surveillance service, but the crimes are to be judged in the country where the crime is committed.
Until now, this group has not caused any problems, and we need to examine exactly what has happened and consider further.
But let's talk a little bit about the whistling of the Italian hymn: it's not a crime either, but, if I may say so, it's not a well-education."
