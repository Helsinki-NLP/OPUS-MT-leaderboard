Found a 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere
The police have had a search mission for a nine-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday night.
The disappearance report on a boy who left West Tampere with his friend has spread in social media.
According to the police station, we've got contact with the boy, and he's got no danger of life and health.
The son's father told the evening-Sanom, knowing he was found.
He's fine, and now we're starting the follow-up.
The boy was found in the neighborhood, so my dad told me.
Ronaldo's wild again, tearing the painting apart at Mess.
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish League during the weekend and continued his work in the Masters League.
The fight between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo from the Masters League's goaldom turned for at least a moment.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved to the top of all-time scorer statistics alone when he shot the visitor Shahtar Donetski's network with two hits on the penalty kicks and one on the gambling situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when the Barcelona Messiah, who was on a level with him before Tuesday, had 77 hits.
Real won the 4-0.
Juventus has been stumbling in the Italian football league in Serie A since the beginning, but in the Champions League section D, he started with a two-to-one win in Manchester City.
The victory goal was won over ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack bore Sergei Aguero with a knee-jerk.
The Aguero who was injured during the week in the semi-final game only arrived at the airport in the last ten minutes.
The Second Manchester Society also suffered severe in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering 1-2 losses.
The 20-year-old manU law-enforcementist Luke Shaw's guest fight only took a quarter an hour.
The dangerous look of Hector Moreno's PSV hit the manU pack so badly that Shaw was likely to break his leg.
Shaw was lying on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium for a dozen minutes before the medical staff left to take him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to 1-0 in 41st minute, but ManU's pleasure lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened out before the break at an extra time.
In the second half of the year, the winner of the PSV was Luciano Narsingh.
In the Masters League of the Painting season, section A was started by Paris Saint-Germain.
It was Angel Di Maria of Argentina who changed Manchester United's shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through right and lifted Johan Wiland, the goaltender of Malmo to the back corner of the ball.
Edinson Cavani did 2-0 for the second half of PSG.
PSG has been bet on the success of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's long-term euro, is not the best benchmark.
For the first time, Ibrahimovic, the star of PSG, met Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmo in 1999.
Roman Ermenko played 90 minutes after his team lost 0-1 to Wolfsburg in the B-section match in Germany.
The opposition party immediately called for a divorce. The president gave the wrong speech.
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, has again given the same speech in Parliament as he gave at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech Mugabe apparently didn't realize the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is fully alive.
The MDC, the main opposition party, called on Mugabe to resign, because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants rushed to say that the confusion had only taken place in Mugabe’s staff and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mr Mugabe's speech addressed the impact of China on the country's economy earlier and now.
Germany and Austria want an extra summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an extraordinary summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, will assess the request.
According to the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
The negotiations on the quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, at the Minister of Interior's table.
The professor will admit he shot his girlfriend on the emergency call.
University professor Shannon Lamb asked for a voice in an emergency call to a slightly shaking police officer at his house and told him he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was present and probably alive and probably scared. The professor told me that the contact details of the dead woman’s family would be on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss's body and a message from the White Paper: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could cancel what I did. I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," said the letter that Lamb signed said.
There were no signs in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 500 kilometers to the school campus. The police found Ethan Schmidt, a history professor who was held dead in his office on campus, who was believed to have shot Lamb.
Ms. Lynn Buford, head of police at Delta State University, said that the university officials were informed of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
According to him, the Lamb called a fatal emergency call for a while after this.
There was one more death in the day, and the Lamb took his own life when the police caught him.
On the day following the shooting, students and teaching staff remained visibly behind closed doors, and the authorities were still trying to find out about Lamb’s motives.
The researchers explained the details in both places, and those who knew Lamb told about the man. The researchers were given a picture of a talented but perhaps problematic teacher.
Students always said they were looking forward to the professor's lessons.
According to Gautier's police at Prentiss' death, the professor had no previous history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, for his part, had mentioned in his book Lamb, which had given recognition to "the happy people" with whom he was allowed to live an academic life.
Both worked at the Department of Social Sciences and History, which had 17 teaching staff. Many of the students participated in both men’s courses.
However, there were indications of problems.
The student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, told me that the professor seemed agitated and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
The second student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him at the end of the academic year 2014-2015 that he was suffering from stress.
She had previously asked Delta State University for sick leave because of some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's salary policy meant that the claim that Lamb had worked hard for would not automatically guarantee him the post of assistant professor.
The university’s principal, William LaForge, reported that he was not aware of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that there was a clear problem with Lamb.
These are the questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After leaving campus, the police found out what route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken his own life with a 38-caliber pistol in the back yard of the house in the Mississippi Greenville, about a mile from his parents' home, the D.C.M. Methel Johnson told me.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
The police didn't immediately find out why Lamb had gone to this very house, but Johnson told me he believed that he knew the residents of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started his work as a professor of geography and educational sciences at the University with 3 500 students. The city had 12,000 inhabitants in 2009.
In the spring, he received his doctorate in education.
One of Lamb’s longest friends described this as intelligent, charismatic, and fun.
Carla Hairston told me she met Lamb through her friends when she was 15 years old and she was 20 years old.
He and his friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who spent years trying to teach Hairston a guitar.
"Lamb was a very heart-breaker at the time.
All the girls were at his side," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Apparently, Lamb and Prentiss had been seeing each other for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me that he killed his wife, but according to no record, they were not married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in a river ski resort in Gautier's little town.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me that he divorced Prentiss 15 years ago.
"He was so shocked," O'Steen said about his daughter.
"The daughter and mother were best friends."
O'Steen hadn't met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter, Abigail, that she liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both appeared at the summer event three years ago.
Later, they also played together.
According to O'Steen, his daughter plays music and plays music of her own.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Jules Room restaurant outside Gautier, reported seeing Lamb and Prentiss on 5 September when Lamb had played guitar and lipstick for a few audiences.
Nothing told me that something was wrong.
"Happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We were kidding together.
They both had a good sense of humor."
"Professor Schmidt, who died, directed first-year seminars and was specializing in the history of the Indians and colonial times," said Professor Don Allan Mitchell.
She was married, and she had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was chairman of his own brotherhood and college.
On the campus of Delta State University, Cleveland, there are 900 people gathered at the memorial ceremony in candlelight.
Schmidt's wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a night's event where the University Choir performed songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis situation is over.
This is a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Assistant journalists: Associated Press journalists Emily Wagster Cheats in Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected because the police are now telling us that the emergency call was made by Lamb after Schmidt was shot, and it was also specified that although he referred to Prentiss as his wife in the emergency call, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us is not about to hire as many seasonal workers as last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products tells us that he is offering his current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity to work extra hours.
The company plans to hire 40 000 people for shops and distribution centres across the country. In 2014, it hired 45 000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
The interviews of applicants will start this month and new employees will start in October-December.
Although there are still months to go, the trade season is approaching a good pace, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers for shops and the delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of the film Return to the Future was an important moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The first night also had a personal meaning.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the Royals to arrive, and I noticed that there was an empty space next to me, and it became clear to me that Princess Diana was coming with me," Fox told me about the coming back in Time document in the trailer.
"When the movie started, I realized the situation was very similar to dates with the Princess of Wales."
Back in Time is related to Back to the Future, and in addition to Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd are interviewed as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
The movie Return to the Future got its premiere 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely a time travel film for me," Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be published in VOD and DVD format and will be presented in selected cinemas starting from October.
UN Secretary-General: no military solution in Syria
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on the intensified Russian military action and notes that there is no military solution to the nearly five-year conflict, and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General once again invited all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban told of his intention to meet five permanent member states of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would take place later this month in connection with the Ministerial Week of the UN General Assembly.
Mr Ban regretted that the dispersal of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the regional powers had caused a situation which could not be resolved.
In the context of the Syrian crisis, Mr Ban called on five permanent Member States to show the same solidarity and unity that reached the Iranian nuclear agreement.
Eight chapters of support polls: Is Donald Trump serious?
They've been trying to label Trump as an empty-talker.
He's also been considered a joke.
Some tell Trump about the crash.
In the Republican circles, all efforts have been made to pull Trump down from the gallup line without results (secondly).
Ten out of the eleven national collars are showing Donald Trump two-digit support figures, some of which are already seriously considering what it actually says about the potential candidates for real estate mogul.
However, the elections are only in the early stages.
There is no announcement yet that Trump will be elected as a Republican candidate.
Experts point out that Rick Perry, who was at this time in 2011 at the Galuppkärje, was allowed to give space to the rising Herman Cain.
Trump would be difficult in public elections for many reasons.
External groupings, such as Jeb Bush Super PAC and the economic conservative Club for Growth, have noticed Trump's strong position and started digging his grave to overthrow him.
The following recent gallup data show that real estate mogul cannot be ignored by means of an oligarch:
There's been a complete turn of events in favour of Trump.
Just before Trump announced that he would stand as a candidate in mid-June, according to the Gallup of Monmouth University, only two out of ten Republicans had a positive picture of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, 40% already had a positive view.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding share was 52 per cent.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive image of Donald Trump.
In about three out of ten, the image is negative.
These figures will also be held in the states where the elections will take place first.
Last week's Quinn Market Gallup, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of Republicans would be pleased with Trump's nomination.
In CNN and ORC’s gallup last week 67% of Republicans stated that they were very satisfied or satisfied with Trump’s possible selection as a candidate.
Only two out of ten would be very dissatisfied with Trump's candidacy.
Ben Carson has almost as much enthusiasm as Trump (43% would be very satisfied with Carson's nomination and 40% with Trump's nomination).
Who's the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, whose respective contribution is 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were elected as a party candidate.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump's temper to be problematic.
Donald Trumpia has been widely criticised for the magnitude and insulting comments. 52% of Republican supporters across the country consider the property mogul properties suitable for the president. The views are reflected in the opinion poll of ABC News and Washington Post.
The same reading applies to Iowa, where the party meeting is held first: according to the Quinn Market Gallup, 52 per cent of Republicans consider Trump's personal properties to be appropriate to the Chief of Defence Forces.
However, according to ABC and Post’s Gallup, 44% believe that Trump is not able to function effectively and 6 out of 10 consider Trump’s temperament inappropriate for the White House.
The Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected as a party candidate, CNN and ORC Gallup say four out of ten believe Trump's chances.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on behalf of Jeb Bush.
Overall: The Republicans have not had a very reliable crystal ball in use before.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry likely to be a candidate, and only 28 percent of Mitt Romney.
The majority seems to think Trump's campaign is convincing.
Even if the Republicans support another candidate, Trump covers almost all the other candidates.
Some experts believe that a divided camp is likely to benefit Trump when Trump’s opponents are divided into different candidates.
At the beginning of September, Monmouth University's opinion poll revealed that in the imaginary duel between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would almost always receive a larger support team.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He's even with Ted Cruz.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson would take a 19-point break from Trump in imaginary duel.
A small majority of Trump's supporters say that they have already taken a vote.
According to the Gallup published by CBS and NYT on Tuesday, a fair half of Trump's supporters are sure of their vote.
Of course, the situation may change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a certain voter may also change his or her mind.
46% of Trump's supporters have not taken a final decision.
Trump's currently very rival is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already elected their candidates are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans share Trump's view of immigration.
After Donald Trump's campaign speech two months ago, immigration from Mexico as rapists has been a hot topic for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's grandiose speeches will banish important Latin American voters from the Republican population and hamper brand renewal.
However, according to the opinion polls published on Monday by ABC News and Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans are on the same lines as Trump on migration issues.
As long as immigration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Dissatisfaction with the administration is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republicans' votes.
The Republican troops want a fresh face instead of a political cracker. According to the latest opinion poll of ABC News and Washington Post, this was the opinion of six out of ten Republicans.
These two candidates are also pissed off at Washington.
According to the opinion poll of Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the activities of the Republicans in Congress: 54% are dissatisfied and 21% are on the brink of rage."
Jeremy Corby's debut in Prime Minister's Question Time
Since the elections, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been looking forward to Corbyn's first performance.
The Labour Party Labour's new frontal image, Jeremy Corbyn, is due to rise for the first time in David Cameron's Question Time later.
Corbyn puts forward the first of his six questions shortly after noon, and the media and the Labour Party's representatives are following the man with a hard eye.
Corbyn has called for less theater and more facts for the weekly show.
He has also stated that he can skip part of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
At the meeting, Corbyn's leadership will be weighed for the first time in connection with the parliamentary test, following the assembly of the shadow government and the speech he gave at the annual meeting of the Corbyn Trade Unions (TUC) on Tuesday.
The Labour Party's decision to keep quiet in the 75th anniversary of the British Air War held during the national song on Tuesday has received criticism from several representatives of the Tory Party.
Corbyn's silence during the national song attracted attention
Corbyn's representative noted Corbyn's position during the national song, in silence respecting the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
However, in the BBC Two's Newsnight program, Owen Smith, a member of the Corbyn Shadow Government, told us that he would have called on the party leader to join the national song despite the contradiction of this monarchy.
The ten shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first-rate groups, relying on differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Less than a sixth of the party initially supported the election of Corbyn to the party leadership.
Robin Brant, the correspondent for BBC's policy, considers that the political differences about British membership of the EU and the conditions for granting benefits tightened up in the Labour Party since the appointment of Corbyn.
At the meeting in Tuc, Corbyn said that Labour was going to propose changes to remove the restrictions completely.
Hours later, Mr Smith, Minister for Labour and Pensions of the shadow government, said that the party's position was very clear: it was only opposed to the government's plans to cut the limit from 26 000 to 23 000 pounds.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader facing David Cameron over the past decade under the leadership of the Tory Party.
A new approach to politics, the promising Director of Labour, says that he has chosen to ask Cameron the questions of the 30 000 proposals he received from the public.
According to Corbyn, elected from the Islington North constituency, Question Time has too many clashes, so he promises to avoid clever words and hurdles and to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that the shadow minister, Angela Eagle, will cover her in Question Time, for example, when Cameron is on a trip abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also thrown into the air the idea that others could sometimes get away with it, and he tells us that he has discussed it with the President of Parliament, Mr Bercow.
After Corbyn took office in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted a puppet theatre policy, often linked to Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in his quest.
Since Question Time was first broadcast in 1990, it has been considered as a key measure of the leadership's judgment, of the underroom and of the position, but according to the critics, Question Time has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": from homeless young photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.
A meaningful way to learn and earn has been found for a group of former street children.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit photography studio that teaches homeless young people to photograph their home area and earn at the same time.
BBC News met a young person who was completed through the project among the first.

The weight will be increased as the United Kingdom's wages rise
The weight was strengthened as wages rose in the UK, and SABMILLer drew the FTSE 100 index up.
In May to July, wages and salaries rose by 2.9 per cent in the UK compared to the corresponding period last year.
More rapid than predicted growth was the fastest since 2009.
The pound was increased by 1 % and the rate was quoted at 1.5505 dollars. The pound also increased in relation to the euro and was quoted at 1.3730 euros.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent to 6.229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMILLer, whose rate was 20 % when the company received the initial offer from the competing company AB InBev.
If the trade were to take place, it would bring together the two largest breweries in the world and bring under the same roof brands, such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent in the wake of the positive results of the competing Richemont Group, which focuses on luxury products.
The latest sales figures of Richemont are better than forecast. The evolution of sales was also due to the rise in the key market for Burberry in China.
Glencore’s share rose by 5% of the mining waste’s announced intention to raise $2.5 billion in share capital as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mond's shares were the biggest drop of 4.3 per cent when Goldman Sachs dropped the company's share price for sales purposes.
The JD Sports rate rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports company informed that its return before taxes would increase by 83 per cent to GBP 46.6 million.
JD Sports boss: higher wage costs could be detrimental to enlargement
According to Peter Cowgill, chairman of the JD Sports Executive Board, raising the minimum wage in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs may jeopardise JD Sports' plans for enlargement and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches a grass-root campaign against Ald's girdle.
Metcash is trying to secure his IGA store from the invasion of Ald in southern and western Australia.
The wholesaler of food, Metcash, has launched a grass roots campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retail stores in South and West Australia against the invasion of Aldin’s $700 million Australia.
Aldi intends to open two distribution centres and the first up to 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build an IGA brand for marketing in mainstream media and social media, and organise events such as Adelaide show.
IGA stores and suppliers, as well as many brands, are involved in the campaign. For example, Simmo, an ice cream factory located in Dunsborough, offers tasteful IGA stores, and traders sell tickets to South Australian football league games at a discount price.
Metcashi is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and iron trade block organises the annual investment strategy day.
It is a major market, since South and West Australia account for almost 30% of Metcashi's IGA footprint and the coverage of these areas is higher than the IGA network in the Eastern States.
South and West Australian consumers are known for their cornerness, and IGA traders have a significantly higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. In South Australia, the market share is 30% and in West Australia 24%, while in the east, the share is only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley's analysts believe that Aldi will catch up to 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores.
This week, Morgan Stanley’s analyst Tom Kierath estimated that the sale of IGA traders could be made with a $360 million and a $250 million loan for Metcashi’s sale by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Australia next year and will reach 500 million dollars and 600 million dollars in these areas.
Metcashi's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volume can result in a loss of $13 million before interest and taxes, says Kierath.
At the same time, Metcast loses market share in the eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although according to a recent study by Roy Morgan, IGA’s customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi's food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and by 2.1 per cent in 2018. Its market share would fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading portfolio manager of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, told us at an event in Melbourne that it is very likely that Metcash will disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to take a public position on Douglass' comments.
It is understandable that a member of the Metcashi government contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, the market share of IGA has fallen from 18% to 14% and the result of Metcashi’s food business serving 1200 IGA dealers has fallen by 43% from 2012 levels.
However, the wholesaler is taking counter-measures and is making an annual fine of over $150 million to meet the prices of Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products each week. Ketju wants to support traders in the reform of stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the range of food brands in trade.
According to Metcashi’s CEO, Ian Morrise, the price review and the sales reform plans are at a good pace and the company will be able to raise its profits again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, chairman of the Australian tennis union, defends Thanasi from Kokkinak
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his behaviour instead of criticism.
According to Steve Healy, the chairman of the Australian tennis union, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a side victim in the recent gang of Nick Kyrgios, and the chef deserves a special mention instead of criticism.
The younger party of the two named "Special K", Kokkinakis, was exposed to the unfavorable beam of light when the bad boy Kyrgyos provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal ATP tournament.
Soon thereafter, in the game between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison in Cincinnati, the judge had to separate the rivals twice. "Wawrinkan should have given his back to the Kyrgios and my friend," Harrison said.
In the U.S. open, Kokkinakis struck the field with frustration when the powerful cramps ruined his fight. Healy has faithfully defended the Kokkinakis.
At the moment, the teenage star is in Glasgow, where he is fighting with Sam Groth for the single-handed second-rate behind Bernard Tomic at the Davis Cup semifinal against Great Britain.
"I strongly believe that your Thana has been dragged into her dispute," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the match in the open in the United States. He is certainly not the first player to break his bat because of frustration. I know Thanas so well that he is not proud of his actions.
However, he has endured very well, for example, the provocative behaviour of Harrison in the United States, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature by the age of 19, he works very hard and completes a very good team. He has never had problems with other players, and he is respected among players. He is practicing hard, is in good condition and a really stable and mature young man. I think he should be assessed on the basis of his own merites."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from the Australian team on Friday from an important round. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision for all parties involved. However, he supports the return of Canberra to the long-term confirmation of the team.
"First, we want to focus fully on the fights instead of the polemic that relates to Kyrgios," Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Federer and Murray, among other things, have pointed out, the youngster has to grow up in the light of publicity. He deserves his criticism of his bad mistakes. However, we are trying to support him in order to understand the consequences of his actions. We are also trying to provide him with our own peace.

European migrant crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary, which declared its emergency situation, closed its southern border from Serbia's direction on Tuesday and caught illegal immigrants, with the aim of preventing the migratory flow.
There was chaos at the border when hundreds of immigrants came together in a non-EU country and the Serbian authorities reacted in a fierce manner.
People fleeing violence were forced to stay on the road between country inspection posts for an indefinite period of time in their tents
The futility began to rise to the surface.
As the police helicopter flew in the air above the immigrants, they said, "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some protested against eating and drinking strike.
The Serbian Foreign Minister stated that it does not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as more arrivals from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not increase the damage.
The situation needs to be discussed in Brussels and in other countries," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
At the border between Hungary and Serbia, a day later, the 28-state grouping failed to develop a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, that the responsibility for the 40,000 floods of asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was shared, and that there was a hope that an agreement would be reached next month or by the end of the year on which 120 000 immigrants, including Hungary, would be received by the EU Member States.
On Tuesday, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit for the next week in order to discuss the Immigrant Crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary did not hope for urgent action by Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that the authorities in the two southern regions were able to put in place more effective means of closing roads and speeding up legal processes in the area of asylum.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence on the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migration flows from that direction, now that there is already a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners participated in the tender for the finishing of the barbed wires between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck for migrants and a transit point to the European Union, many of which are refugees from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban argued that most of the people arriving are refugees of standard of living, not refugees of war, who have the right to seek security, and that the views of other EU countries, including Germany, are very strong.
According to the new law that entered into force in Hungary at midnight, it is a crime to cross or damage a four-metre barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border towards Serbia, which also defines longer prisoners for convicted traffickers.
"As a result of the situation caused by mass migration, the government is declaring the crisis situation in the country", the government's informant, Zoltán Kovacs, told journalists in the city of Szeged in the south of the country.
"We follow a strict line: illegal border crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still has to accept military action, which is expected next week. Associated Press News Office journalists at the border have been seeing heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and military dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakongi, Orban’s internal security adviser, said that the authorities have captured 45 border crossings to try immediately at the border and 15 further away.
By harming the fence, the people who have crossed the border are now in the hands of the police, and they are accused of crimes under new laws.
The authorities will correct the fence quickly.
In addition, two of the seven border crossing points on the Serbian border closed by the Hungarian authorities on Tuesday.
Chaos occupied the main border crossing point near Roszke in Hungary, when Hungarians opened a small metal container with a point of contact where people were packed in.
About 20 fit in, but thousands were left out.
Another group of immigrants blocked the main street, which connects Serbia and Hungary. People reported to be in a food and drink strike until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton’s leadership in relation to Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, by national gallup
The percentage of former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton's support is still two-digit in the race for the National Democratic presidential candidate, but Senator Bernie Sanders has closed the gap.
Clinton's support now stands at 47% of the votes of democratic supporters (down from 58%), while Sanders is the second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure in the presidential competition, and his support among the Democrats is 15%.
More than five months before the pre-election, it is too early to tell the majority of Democrats which candidates they are in favour of.
However, Clinton’s supporters are more sure of their choice than other candidates.
Since the Gallup by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost the support of several democratic groups, while new supporters have joined Sanders' camp.
Clinton still has a strong lead among women and moderates, but the lead is narrower.
Clinton's support for men has fallen significantly, and he has only a five-percent bow against Sanders.
Clinton has lost his leading position amongst democracies under the age of 50, and he's now on a level with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton's advantage in favour of Sanders was two-digit among liberals, but now Sanders has taken a five-percent neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats are happy to support Clinton if he is elected as a party candidate.
A quarter would support Clinton with little reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
I do not think it is surprising that Clinton's current supporters would also be particularly enthusiastic if he were elected candidate.
There is more disintegration in the views among those who do not currently support Clinton. Only about a quarter would support him with zeal.
48% of the Democrats would support Clinton, while only 35% of the Republican voters would be eager to support Donald Trump, the most popular Republican candidate.
When Clinton's voters are asked to freely describe why they are in favour of his nomination, the most popular argument is the correct experience of Clinton (16%) and the most popular answer is that it is time to elect a female president (13%) and, thirdly, that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
There are also common views and opportunities to win the actual elections.
The Vice-President is still pounding his potential candidate, and 57% of the Democrats would like to see him go after the race, and instead, a third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When the Democrats are consulted with the second most popular candidate for the party, most of them choose Biden.
Over half of Clinton's supporters, Biden is the second most popular candidate since Clinton and significantly more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton will increase his head start over Sanders. With Sanders, the head start is 20 percentage points, and it's going to grow to 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
55% of the Democrats consider Clinton to be the candidate with the best chance of winning the actual elections, but the proportion has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden, number two, is far from Clinton, but more and more believes in Biden's chances of winning the actual elections.
However, democratic voters prefer views on the issue to the candidates.
The voters do not think that any candidate for democracy or potential candidates are unacceptable.
The voters consider democratic candidates or potential candidates to be appropriate for their characteristics.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, reliable, and leading types.
Biden is often described as being honest, whereas Clinton is often considered to be a type of leader.
As many as 30 percent of the Democrats do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, while Sanders is 15%. 27% cannot say whether Sanders is honest.
In the opinion of the Democrat voters, the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to the ideology of voters.
For all features, about a quarter have no opinion on Sanders.
When asked about the views of voters on the use of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail and its own server as Foreign Minister, the majority of democratic voters say that they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation and that it has not changed the opinion of these voters on Clinton.
The Americans disagree more widely.
Half the Americans are dissatisfied with Clinton's report, and only one third are satisfied.
The public's views were divided in March, when the conflict had just come out.
The majority of Americans believe that the controversial use of email has not affected their overall image of Clinton. 36% say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36%, the majority of six out of ten are Republicans.
Although the voters of their own party consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these characteristics when asked about the views of all voters: Clinton is only 32% honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
Of all voters, 62% do not consider Clinton honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable either.
But both Clinton and Trump get good grades from leadership.
Of the six candidates involved in the survey, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
Most people think Sanders is honest, but as with Carson, many people don't have Sanders' opinion.
The sample of the questionnaire is 351 voters and the error margin of the questionnaire is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is catching up with Donald Trump's lead in the National Support Survey.
According to CBS News and the latest support survey in the New York Times, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates grabbed more than half the votes in the new poll and left the other candidates far behind.
Among the Republican voters in the whole country, Trump still has strong support. The support rate has risen before the debate last month on 23% of the CBS survey conducted by Fox News. According to a questionnaire published on Tuesday, the support rate is 27%.
However, Carson's support would rise from 6% to 23% in the same period.
According to the poll, Carson has strong support in all the population groups, and in a high-school group, he's hitting Trump.
With the exception of Carly Fiorina and the Ohio Governor John Kasich, the Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support is the weakest and has fallen from 10% last month to 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio distributed the third place with a 6 percent vote.
The error margin of 376 Republican voters in the sample is 6 per cent in the direction or in the other direction, which was carried out in September.
According to the latest survey by CNN and ORC last week, Carson's support is on the rise, which is supported by 19% of Republicans, while Trump's support is 32%.
Also in the latest survey by ABC News and Washington Post, Trump was clearly in charge of Carson.
At last week's meeting with the men, Trump launched an endless charge against a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized after questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said on Saturday when he was campaigning in Iowa.
Five members of the department charged with the death of Baruch College's fuxi.
Almost two years ago, five people were charged with murder following the death of a student in the district ritual in Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania.
The members of Pi Delta Ps's Division of Baruch College (City University of New York) brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng in September 2013. According to the police, the department did not deliver Deng to the hospital in time, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes were tied, his back had been placed in a bag of nearly 15 kilos of sand filled with sand, and he had repeatedly been attacked in an attempt to reach the destination placed on the other side of the ice field.
Deng is reported to have first complained about headaches and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, members of Pi Delta Ps's department didn't call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and they said they were waiting an hour before Deng was taken to the hospital.
At the press conference, Commissioner Chris Wabner said that the members had time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the president of the department.
"At this point, the members began to hide the tools, putting the interests of the department ahead of Michael Deng's health", Wagner said.
Deng couldn't be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had been hit several times in the head, upper body, and thigh with a blunt object.
"A lot of families have been shocked by the shattering of the company, as at least one student per year has died as a result of the embellishment since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the family of Deng, in his opinion.
The departments and their members must be held accountable where the authorities must take an important step.
The great jury of Monroe County made five members of the division to be charged with the murder of the third degree.
In addition, 32 members of the Division will be charged with simulturing and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to be responsible not only for the individuals, but also for the organisation that officially or informally approved the simulation," Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College put the department under a ban and the national department resigned from the local department.
Thus, the increase in the interest rates of the U.S. Central Bank (Fedin) has an impact
The rise in interest rates and the rise in the stock market became fragile, the return on securities is rising and the economy is falling into recession.
That's what we know.
On the other hand, we do not know how long it will take and how long it will last.
Especially with regard to the economy, we find a reference to timing in history.
The recession has arrived up to 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank is often aggressively raising interest rates, although not always. The key is how the economy and financial resources react.
That is why the officials of the central bank have already stressed that investors would not pay attention to the fact that the interest rate will start to rise, but to the length of time it will take to normalise the situation.
There are, of course, several variables involved.
Finally, however, market players may find that any increase in interest rates may be exaggerated.
"The central bank's first raise after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money," Julian Jessop, the Chief of Capital Economics, told its customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual normalisation of interest rates at a relatively low level; it is a scary stopover for many.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here are examples of how the effects can be seen in different areas of the economy based on historical trends:
As has been seen on the market for about a month now, an increase in interest rates may increase instability for some time.
When the interest rates finally rise, the effect is not so dramatic.
"The trend would appear to be the stagnation of interest income on capital after the first raise for 12 to 24 months, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank's analyst in a recent study of the consequences of the increase in interest rates.
A sharp rise of approximately 14%, relatively steady for the next 250 days (mean increase of 2.6%), after 500 days, and the average interest rate after six stocks is 14.4%, says Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management's Chief Equity in the Strategic Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the impact on the shares will generally increase slightly later in the cycle and interest income will begin to decrease.
The recession is a reality in the economy, but the rise in interest rates usually works for it.
In this case, if the central bank encounters circumstances that did not exist before and which could accelerate the downturn.
Particular attention is paid to the fact that gross domestic product is at its lowest ever in view of the increase in the central bank’s interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the nominal value has been less than 4.5% since 1950 in the increase of 118 interest rates.
Although the second quarter of 2015 shows 3.6 per cent, many did not imagine it to last, and in the third quarter 1.5 per cent, reports Atlanta’s regional central bank.
The rise in interest rates in such a sensitive economic situation may present a risk and may ask whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
The market participants have been talking about raising the steering rate for the whole year, and the look will turn to the Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting this week, which will end on Thursday.
Many strategies and economies believe that, even if the Open Market Committee approved the increase at this meeting, futures trade will only show a 25% probability.
"In our studies since 1950, all lifting cycles to date have been in a supercycle, where even before the decline in GDP is rising very rapidly since the beginning of the upturn", the report states.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst depression of the reference period.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the central bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now the 74th month is going.
In addition, fixed-income securities have been unstable in the past of the market, and the formula is repeated on the capital side.
"The underlying difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on shares when the central bank changes the exchange rate.
For bonds, the return appears to change the direction as soon as the first up/down cycle starts.
At the end of the take-off cycle, revenues will fall immediately", Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategicists believe that interest-raising will bring long and short-term bonds closer together and the curve level.
"High-income bonds often do better in such an environment, although we are still cautious about incomes," said Kathy Jones, analyst for fixed-income securities in Schwab.
Interestingly, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future change of direction of the central bank.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the forecasts of inflation, there are already several signs of a tightening of financial policy," says Jones.
Short-term interest rates are on the rise, the yield curve is direct, the credit risk margins are increased and volatility is increased.
In a broad sense, companies that operate mainly on the US market will benefit because the interest rate is falling and local products are becoming attractive.
The outlook for debt-debted multinationals is weaker, as a stronger dollar will lead to higher prices of their products on the global market and higher debt.
"Historia shows that quality shares are more profitable in the next three months after the interest rate increase," Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
The companies with a strong balance sheet were overrun by five percentage points on average after the 1994, 1999 and 2004 interest payments.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares also improved their quality by an average of 4 percentage points and 3 percentage points respectively.
"The debt is a big question.
The companies that have a significant share of the variable rate debt lose the most," Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers are generally also benefiting from a dollar increase.
Savingrs also benefit from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effects are visible.
Parliamentary Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for being too popular.
According to Bingham, today it is difficult to separate the channel from its commercial competitor.
He also claims that the BBC Music Awards Award is only a copy of the British Gala.
Parliamentary Damien Collins, on the other hand, blames The Voice for impersonality.
According to a significant parliamentary panel, BBC Radio 3 gradually becomes a copy of the Classic FM channel. The charges increase the pressure on the station to prove that each of them offers other commercial radio stations.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC’s management that the radio channel of the broadcasting company is becoming too populist and that the channel is no longer exactly different from its commercial competitor.
"I hate to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to be changing in the direction of the Classic FM channel," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards award gala held last December will also receive criticism from Bingham:
"The BBC Music Awards, organised for the first time in the last year, seem like a copy of the British Prizes.
These two are examples of the fact that instead of new and different, what is already on the market is being copied," Bingham says.
The Director-General of BBC denied the accusations and stated that BBC Radio 3 had a significantly higher commercial competitor than live music and enlightening content.
"At Radio 3, I learned from classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The commitment of the channel to live music and music is entirely in its own category.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to looking for new music and ordering new works," the President said.
Earlier this year, the leader of BBC Radio 3 Alan Davey said that the station must work harder to keep the audience interested, as the British are better acquainted with classical music.
However, Radio 3 is not the only tough one in the consultation of the restricted Committee on Culture, Media and Sport that has received criticism of entering the territory of commercial channels.
Tory parliamentary minister Damien Collins criticised The Voice's talent search competition, which BBC bought from a Dutch producer Talpa Media, estimated at GBP 22 million.
"The programme is not much discussed, as it is not unique or particularly distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, the program presented by BBC1, which, as the star judges of Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced in a typical manner for BBC.
In addition, Collins called upon the company to look for a hit program in its own garage when the next time it launched a new series of entertainment.
Collins did not, however, agree to exclude the continued ordering of the Voice series or the use of taxpayers’ money for other forms of entertainment.
E-commerce growth slowest ever in August – perhaps due to black Friday
In the first months of 2015, e-commerce grew by seven per cent.
The sales of e-commerce have been recorded since 2000. In the past month, growth was the slowest ever.
Three years ago, the online shop was strengthened by mobilization.
Experts believe that the black Friday of November can curb the desire to buy.
For more than ten years, the takeover of online commerce has desolated many of Britain’s shopping streets.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is getting better, and new sales figures show only a 7 % increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, growth in total sales was slowest throughout the period when the sales of e-commerce have been recorded, i.e. since 2000. Last year, e-commerce grew by only five per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is getting better, and new sales figures show only a 7 % increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If we compare last year's growth with last year's 2000 figures, it is clear that growth will stabilise over time", IRG's editor-in-chief Andy Mulcahy told the Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, e-commerce accelerated three years ago when consumers adopted mobile reception.
"It enabled more and more people to buy online, and for many it was possible to buy in different environments, such as the sofa.
When mobilization is now more moderate, growth can stabilise."
Black Friday from America is a phenomenon that is considered to be one of the causes of the slowdown in growth.
According to experts, the last day on Friday in November can cause consumers to postpone the purchase decision before black Friday.
Last year five times the number of online buyers compared to normal caused many traders to crash websites.
Experts believe that a black Friday, which makes consumers push for offers, can curb the desire to buy during the rest of the time.
According to a study published by the British Retail consortium, a fair pound per five pounds was consumed online.
More than one third of certain products, such as television and washing machines, are purchased from online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of fashion shops.
The Meka is burying the victims of the crane accidents, the Bin Laden family responsible.
The Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funeral was held in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, a major construction company, Saudi Bingo Group, is partly responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were injured after the crane fell.
Body was carried high in the air when Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the crane that fell upon Mecca's Great Mosque.
A number of white people had gathered together on the streets to say good-bye to the victims on their final journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The suppressed tour passed through a pilgrimage, where a fallen building crane had only been penetrated through a mosque roof a day earlier by Muslims.
The King of Saudi Arabia called upon Bin Laden’s construction family company to be responsible for an accident involving 394 people.
The bodies of 29 victims who died in the Mecca Great Mosque accident were transported on the streets.
After the fall of Nosturi among the dead, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Suur-Manchester, had traveled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been with his parents in the Great Mosque, who were starting their annual hair-sacrifice journey.
The Saudi Arabian authorities have promised that a hay-sacrifice would be held when thousands of people are currently arriving in the city for pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, the Binladin Group should not have left the crane booms up when the crane was not used.
According to the Arab press release, the Binladin Group is involved in the accident.
The English service of the news agency did not report in detail. However, according to the English release, the management of the group is prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the yard of the Great Mosque. Thousands of Muslims are heading to their Great Mosque for the hay-sacrifice later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published a notice of a crane accident and the Group’s representatives have not been reached for the opinion.
The King also accused the group of failing to comply with the updated safety regulations and cooperated with meteorological experts.
Tens of cranes surround Mecca's Great Moscone as part of the huge building project of the Binladin Group.
For decades, the Bin Laden family has had close links with the Saudi Arabian ruling family, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for several important construction projects.
Al Qaida's late leader Osama bin Laden was a apostate son whose family had abandoned in the 1990s.
It was only a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once in his life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered a million ralals (approx. EUR 250 000) to be paid to the victims' families and permanently disabled.
Other injured persons will receive half of the compensation.
According to the B&Q boss, there is a cheap Eastern European workforce behind the phenomenon.
The British hire home generals more often, says Veronique Laury.
Those who come from Eastern Europe who work as professionals have increased their popularity.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores for workers will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, Chief Exchanger, Daily Mail
The British are said to transfer home hammering and painting work to those from Eastern Europe.
Ironing and painting skills seem to be scarce today.
The British are now increasingly employing home generals to do domestic vandalisation work, says the director of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home repair supply chain. According to Laury, the phenomenon is driven by skilled workers from Eastern Europe who provide services at low prices.
As a result, Kingfisher intends to open 200 new Screwfix stores for traders. At the same time, 60 B&Q stores will be closed.
Laury needs more female labour for B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions in the shop are made by a woman.
At the moment, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, the demographic trends need to be taken into account, for more and more women living alone today are also recovering their homes.
"Our sales personnel are still mostly men," Laury says.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of the product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of five women in the tail of companies in the British FTSE 100 index and has also rearranged the company's management team so that men and women leaders are equally engaged.
Kingfisher is almost the only one of its kind, with 50% of its staff being women, including CEO and financial manager.
"This was a conscious decision, and diversity is an important topic for us," Laury said.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women in the management team."
The operating profit and sales figures of Kingfisher for six months show a decline, although the company worked hard after the closure of stores.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The government of three aces decided to resort to coercive legislation in order to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were therefore quite quickly achieved.
The sharp head of the SAK and other employees’ organisations began to be forced to stand on Friday because of the broad expression of workers.
A lot of people think that it also makes sense.
Let's ask if it's worth the strike when things are going bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people online have already come to announce that they are not going to participate in the demonstration, but are going to work.
In the good old days of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no online protest, but openly declaring yourself a rich person would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of trade unions does not give rise to much protest, but it gives cause for thought.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was a few decades ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of Ay's business, the government's rough solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things have seemed to be rolling on their own weight for years, the alliances are now finally able to defend the rights of the worker, in a visible and proper manner.
In this way, the government may want to imprison the role of the Ay movement, when membership in the trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary.
Whatever the organisation's actions may be, it is nonsense that the expression of Friday's mind would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product is falling further and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
Hard savings for the University of Lappeenranta: Objective 8.5 million savings, reduction of staff by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenranta will start a savings course aimed at cutting costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start negotiations on the whole staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million annually.
In practice, this means reducing about 130 workers.
In addition, two million will be saved on other activities.
The 2016 budget, which foresees a deficit of 8,5 million, is the basis for the negotiations on the Single Market.
It is also affected by the cuts in appropriations made by the government.
During this financial year, the University will produce approximately 2.6 million deficits.
Costs will increase slightly next year, but funding from the same ministry will fall by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is around EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined impact of massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in company funding on our university is very significant, says Principal Anneli Pauli in the University Newsletter.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with trustees will be launched next Tuesday and will last for six weeks as prescribed by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland on the railways
The owner of Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also targets rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of Britain's largest railway companies, Souter says.
Rail transport is to be opened up to competition gradually.
The first is close traffic in the capital region in 2017-2018.
There will be long-distance traffic after the short-distance traffic.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes the plans of Onnibus.
Other international companies have reported interest in rail transport at least Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
The time of the interest rate decision
The whole world is following a meeting of the U.S. Central Bank Fed on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on a possible increase in interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
A fair half of the economicians who still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates are now betting that the central bank will maintain interest rates at current levels of between 0 and 0.25%, as shown in the survey conducted by 80 economists at Reuters.
"This is an historic situation, as the central bank has kept the interest rate at zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus trigger normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been relatively good, and the recovery has brought billions of dollars into the balance sheet and has only accelerated inflation slightly.
However, the central bank cannot ignore a global situation that is not equally rose-like.
It has called on the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday 20 a.m. Central European time.
The shooter of Delta State University left an apology note.
After his girlfriend was shot in Mississippi on Monday morning – before his colleague was shot later on the same day – Shannon Lamb wrote a message in which he apologized for the first murder and hoped to withdraw it, the authorities told him on Tuesday.
In Gautier, Mississippi, Delta State University, Lamb called the emergency number about 10 a.m.
Monday and he told me he shot a man.
She asked the police to come home on an emergency call.
"I shot my wife last night," she said, and she also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house, which is no harm to anyone, but who is probably afraid.
The police asked for the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
And the Lamb didn't give us a motive for shooting.
The police arrived at the crime scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, a message from the body and Lamb, which reads as follows: "I am very sorry and I wish I could cancel what I did.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 500 kilometers to Delta State University, where he killed History Professor Ethan Schmidt before taking his life away late on Monday when the police reached him.
The university’s principal, William LaForge, reported that he was not aware of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that there was a clear problem with Lamb.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb believed that Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt. However, on Tuesday, the authorities announced that there was no information or evidence of the triodrama.
Shawn O'Ste, who had been married to Prentiss for seven years, described his ex-wife as a good person.
The couple were divorced 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that she and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's upset.
A man said that his daughter and mother were best friends.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of Prentiss's, Lindsay Knowles, told me that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles stated that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told me about a woman named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called his relatives on Monday and told them that he was not going to jail.
When the police reached Lamb's Highway 1 near Greenville that night, he stopped the car, ran off on foot, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to the CV on the University's website, Lamb received his doctorate in education at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Dimmed Stars
The last few years have been heavy for the actor (in the picture on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also fought drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything that's happened has really been demanding its taxes.
Manchester United on Luke Shaw's side for months because of two fractures.
Luke Shaw's right leg broke in the Manchester United Champions League fight against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender will be sorry to stay side by side for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes Shaw will return to the field this season.
20-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV defense area in a bad fight by Héctor Moreno when the game was under way in 15 minutes.
Shaw was on the field receiving emergency medical assistance for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures in his leg, and he's in hospital," Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or the day after tomorrow for surgery to Manchester.
A young man who joined Manchester United's ranks at the age of 18 has experienced a lot of hard times and is now injured after some wonderful games.
In the locker, Shaw was given oxygen.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when the leg breaks from two points, he'll be sidelined for half a month, and he won't play in the block phase anymore.
I hope he'll be able to play this season.
Moreno seemed to be able to make it when the situation was not followed by a red card penalty.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican player.
According to Van Gali, the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You can conclude on your own, but I thought the situation was worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a two-legged, reckless fight."
Shaw said, "Thank you for all your messages, and I can't tell you how shattered I am, my recovery starts here and I'm coming back stronger."
More on the subject: Manchester United's Luke Shaw side in the PSV match
The British defender has a special reason to recover in order to compete in the European Championships in France in June.
"This is a very serious injury," said the PSV coach.
"In such an injury situation, all parties are always very sorry.
Players are never meant to harm the opponent."
Moreno broke his legs when he played the Netherlands, shot by Van Gali, in the ranks of Mexico, only during the 2014 World Cup.
"He is very sorry, because his purpose was not to harm the opponent. It is a shame to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation.
All I saw was a ball going in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke fighting."
"I know how it feels, and I know how difficult this can be," Moreno said to the SBS6 channel.
"I feel really bad, I'm so sorry."
The PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Modelang.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
In the long run, each parent will notice that the child learns his favorite book almost outside.
Except you see David Cameron.
When the children’s holiday organization asked Cameron to name his favorite children’s books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a Dr. Seuss’ teaching environmental story published in 1971.
In a text published on the SuperCamp website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is fun, touching and creative, and it has a strong message. I love reading it to my children because there is always a picture or message that we haven't noticed before."
That sounds good, except that the next point where Cameron is to describe the story of the book is a summary of the 2012 film, with new characters and details added to complement the short original text.
"In the city of Tarville, from which the real trees and plants have been lost, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey by implementing this greatest dream: to see the right tree," says the text. In 1991, Dr. Seuss' version of Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died, Ted had no object of love.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly in line with the conspiracies of Lorax on the Internet Movie Database. It begins as follows: "In the city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted lives in the heart of Audrey, a girl of his dreams."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book would be so foreign to him. Greed Kerskanen will destroy the trees and make the Nevis despite the opposition of Lorax, a small, thick, moustache creature that protects the forests.
Probably like this, a minor pr task is entrusted to an assistant, apparently to someone who has not read Lorax 20 times in the pipe as a child.
The Prime Minister's representative said that the text was probably from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps did not comment further, but confirmed that the text was Cameron's staff handwriting.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being away from the British team, but it's still hard.
Pakistan's meeting in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but once we see the 3-0 series of tests of the team selected for the tour in England, it is not expected to be repeated.
I wouldn't shut down the possibility of a guest victory.
Alastair Cook can be more inexperienced than a team of three years ago, but the team has good players and the team's attitude is strong – they have no bad experiences since 2012, only youthful positiveness.
As a bally player, Moeen Ali develops as a twister, and Adil Rashid, even though he has no Test-level experience, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the English Test Team and replaced with Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is clearly hard for me to understand as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven tests have been against two good attacks under challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricket players are criticised according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I have said before, players are the best choicers.
A few 50-point fight would have taken place on Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire with more runs.
The main coach in England, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he was not as good as he could have done, which does not surprise me. He is, above all, a team player.
The question of how long the Test bat gets the chance to make its impression is difficult.
Lyth got seven ground fights — like his predecessor Sam Robson — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at both home and guest matches.
The only cause of complaint may be that England first used Jonathan Trot in the Caribbean — when Lyth was in peak condition — but this past opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is on the team, and he's a hitter, and I appreciate it.
He's an unknown author's cricket player that we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us in the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moeen will start a kick-start with Cook, which will bring an extra pitcher into the game while holding four quick feeders, and I am not against the idea.
I see no obstacle to the fact that the top pitcher could be hitting here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great cricket player.
The fashion may not have reached much on its local team in Worcestershire, but he has been a team three player, and that is not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test games as the first replacement player before starting in 2001.
He did three hundred points right away, and there was no return.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a backup feeder, and based on what I have seen about him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics – on average 31 points as a batter and 35 points as a pitcher – and this can be a search shot, but very many of the spinners have not shown themselves to be ready, and the selectors decided to take a young player.
He'll learn a lot during this fight.
Outside of the playing team, England seems to have made a couple of intelligent choices for its coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lanka's batter, Mköri Jayawardene, as the adviser to the Test matches can be a breakthrough.
This is one of the sweetest men of the species who brings much experience with him because he has played under all kinds of conditions and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes on a game trip to the white ball and brings both energy and mercy.
In my opinion, he has always contributed to a suitable international crisis, whether his role was a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has a resourceable intelligence.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, can be an injection.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one day's matches, Root has had a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Even though not everyone agrees, coachs and selectors do not set the match schedule.
And it should be borne in mind that, like players, their jobs depend on results.
These decisions will never be taken without consideration.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is in bad shape in 2017
The renegotiation strategy for Britain to remain in the EU, which remains half-way to David Cameron, is on a deeper scale from day to day, even without the 'yes' or 'no' choice of a pleasant Jeremy to lead the Labour Party or Tuc to mock Europe harshly on Tuesday.
Other countries have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farags.
The European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is in – although not everyone is an act of their own – some Member States are tired of the self-righteous British agenda, which includes dissenting concessions and harmful Treaty changes that they do not really want.
In Brighton, at the annual Congress of TUC, it was decided that they too would not like to see social security broken down in the EU.
We could call it a selfie agent for Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor are living in summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-ranking people, returning home and telling them that they have acquired allies for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to have an open-minded Britain inside the EU tent. 'Don't leave us alone with France', Berlin says and proposes that an increasing number of short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point where we no longer care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's prudent Chancellor of the Alliance is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave office before it is ruined, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Holland has a re-election or a successor's choice in 2017.
His power is fading, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, while in Spain, a left-wing government.
It is difficult to imagine them rushing to help the selfie Brits who could use their energy better to try and prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they do not want it because most of them have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers may deliberately plan to throw useless comments in the Scottish National Party style in the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend proposes.
"The renegotiation was a matter of course." "The British had nothing left to do with the renegotiation."
Europeans know how to catch the British press and how the EU-sceptical oligarch press is, just like Tony Benn's 1975 referendum in favour of 2:1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Perhaps someone remotely remembers Boris Johnson, a sculptive Euro-opportunist, who became known as "our direct EU banana correspondent" in Brussels in the early 90s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
These include tax evasion, hacking phones and the apparent state-of-the-art residents who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same about them, but then realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to hand out bananas to a fool so that the gorilla doesn't eat you both for lunch and dinner.
In opposition to the referendum, Mr Miliband was even more blarite than Blair, and Blair accepted the EU Constitution, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in the referendum in 2005, Blair got out of hand.
The press never forgave him.
But a nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly clapped me on the back of Westminster on Monday, I told him that he no longer had time to spend on me, and there could be a risk that he would introduce Neil Kinnock's media boycott strategy from the '80s, which was a mistake and still is.
It may take time, but Corbyn needs to develop a coherent strategy for dating the media, not with me, but Andrew Marrin, who was sitting on the BBC couch on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
The majority of people outside the U.S. and Tory are likely to respond positively.
That's what Hilary "Benn but Not Bennite" Benn told me on the radio and on TV this week when his inner boy scout tried not to admit that it was a bad move from Corbyn to appoint the rough John McDonnell shadow finance minister.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father had difficulty on TV being unfaithful to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his place in the lower room.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Mr Benn said that he was opposed to staying in the EU 'in all circumstances', and that Mr McDonnel did not say that either to his colleagues or to the members of the House of the House at a private meeting on Monday night.
Corby wanted to care about any image of the miracle, remember that he even touched me. The messenger is important during the 24/7 era, especially in the discipline of social media, where paranoia and fraud are occurring.
Cameron does not need to be given a free passport with regard to the EU, which could make Labour's support self-evident in the referendum, as Mr McDonnell has said.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
McDonnell's and Corbyn's equivalent of EU membership is suitable for the archipelago economy and for the past against capitalism, which are no longer just a part of the narrow circle of left-wing dissidents to whom the idea of a similarity is a central doctrine in the doctrinal struggles.
There is also evidence of the Equivocation in NATO, and Tom Watson is incredibly unscrupulous in the fact that Corbyn is not campaigning for departure, and foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify the matter to their own countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital?
The United States has already been quite disappointed by the poor British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even during the Tory regime's operations, which I received a reminder on Monday in connection with the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise the UK authorities' opinions on electric cigarettes
According to the researchers, the claims made by the state-funded body that the smoking of electric cigarettes is 95 % less harmful than traditional smoking were made at a meeting with 12 participants linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticise the evidence provided by the Public Health England (PHE) public health authority in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal in its report on electric cigarettes.
PHE described his report published last month as "reversible and comprehensive review of results".
However, a number of researchers have questioned the certainty of the data and highlighted the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, Lancet Medical Journal's headline contained a "remarkable horse base" on which PHE's most important conclusion is based.
In addition, two researchers at the BMJ have considered whether the claims were established on "rock or sand".
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Professor of European Public Health Martin McKee and Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University, Simon Capewell, have stated: "The basic assumption of public health is that policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKeen and Capewell, the general public assumes that PHE's argument that "the current best estimate of electric cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than conventional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of the results of research.
The claim stems from one of the 12 meetings convened for the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model. The model aimed at harmonising the views of the participants on the disadvantages of nicotine products.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the meeting supporters included EuroSwiss Health, whose former independent research has been funded by British American Tobacco (BAT), according to sources.
In addition, in the report on sustainable activities, the Executive Director demonstrated his support for BAT’s activities in the field of public health.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting granted funding from the electric acid manufacturer, but the alleged previous funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International was not granted by that participant.
There are no studies on the selection criteria for the panel composition, but there are several well-known supporters of electric cigarettes, some of which acknowledge their participation as a financeer of industry.
However, some participants are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s tobacco handler.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the study report of the group shows that there is no undisputed evidence of the harmfulness of the products in terms of a wide range of products and the fulfilment of their criteria.
However, links or shortcomings are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, no evidence has yet been provided that electric cigarettes can contribute to the smoking of children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim premature.
According to PHE’s Health and Welfare Director, Professor Kevin Fenton’s claims have been answered in the past.
According to Fenton, electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every other person who smokes through life dies because of tobacco addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electric cigarettes are lower than those of conventional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be studied more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what it does not indicate, especially in a situation where the relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the United Kingdom, nearly 80 000 deaths are related to smoking every year, and the cost of smoking is GBP 2 billion per year for public health care.
Responsible action requires that we clearly show the current evidence that electric cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but that their underlying disadvantages are a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastSenders, says Channel 4 boss.
Luke Johnson, led by Channel 4, said that BBC should stop sending certain programs, including EastSenders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hand on the hit series, such as Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the licence fee should be used only for the production of programmes which are not carried out by other television stations.
He criticises the presentation of programmes that are likely to reach a smaller audience at the same time as the large number of competitors' programmes and, for example, the BBC4 channel.
When Tony Hall, Director General of the BBC, announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that for six years he had tried to get Channel 4 cooperation with BBC without results.
"I do not agree with the idea that BBC buys formats and sends programmes that are clearly part of the software of a competing channel," Johnson told the communication committee in the House that explained the future of BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep the broadcaster, which I do not think is necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should reduce its supply at least to programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
BBC sends The Voice to the best time of view because it wants the widest possible support in the future.
If no other channel is worried about the program, it's clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could be financed without subsidies," said Johnson.
The Voice is one of these, EastSenders is another, even though it is its own production.
A lot of channels would give their right hand for it.
I do not understand how this serves the service of the broadcasting company.
I don't think this would be a loss to the BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was in charge of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010. In his view, BBC receives good ratings because the company employs ambitious people and believes that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on BBC's most popular series are similar to those of former Sky boss Tony Ball, who suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that BBC sell out series like EastSenders.
According to Johnson, the programs for the BBC's niche audience are shown on the BBC4 channel, where viewers can't usually be measured, but the programs meet their purpose. "The BBC can say, in defending the 4 billion pounds of broadcasting in its hypocritical missions, that they have made special programmes that no one watched."
"The BBC will present them at times when no one will ever see them."
With regard to broadcasting, Johnson said: "I challenge you to find another system that is as old-fashioned in the sense that who will benefit the best.
Of course, everyone thinks that £150 per year is affordable, but people for whom it is a large amount, especially if BBC is not very viewed."
The former director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, David Elstein, who also expressed his views in committee on Tuesday, stated that the BBC should exchange its ancient missions with new "information, teaching and entertainment".
According to Elstein, BBC’s current supply is hardly equipped with educational programmes – 1% on television and 0.1% on radio. He adds that BBC should learn from Australian and Canadian broadcasting companies and undermine its mission to a new belief: “information, lighting and entertainment”.
As regards the question of cooperation, Elstein proposes that the BBC could increase broadcasts of events such as the Proms Festival, which only had a fraction of the concerts sent last year. "BBC should also join the alliances with commercial channels, so that the whole supply is also available online", he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves through sonogenetics
The video shows how the shuttle house changes direction when ultrasonic is applied.
Researchers have grown worms whose nervous system has been genetically modified, so that the worms can be controlled by ultrasound.
Small shuttleworms change direction when they are subjected to ultrasound, the frequency of which is above the hearing range of the human ear.
Sound waves activate motion nerve cells that are genetically modified to have a transport membrane that reacts to ultrasound.
More on the subject: Researchers follow the activity of the brain by light
According to researchers, worms were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new dubbed sonogenetics method. The ultrasound is used to activate the brain, heart and muscle cells by stimulating the outside of the body.
Salk Instute researcher in La Jolla, California, Sreekanth Chalasani told Guardian that one day the method could replace deep-brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson’s disease, where the brain is stimulated by electrical impulses.
However, Chalasani noticed that worms begin to react when they are placed in a liquid with microscopic small bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the bubbles are increasing ultrasound waves that travel inside the worms.
Stronger ultrasound waves affect TRP4 ion channels, which are part of the worm's cell membranes.
According to an article published in Nature Communications, the sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the cells on which they are attached.
In order to control the shuttleworms by ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of the nerves that control their movement appeared in TRP4 ion channels.
When an ultrasound was directed to the modified worms, the microbubbles reinforced the sound waves and moved to the worms, when the signal began to move in the nerve cells.
The method resembles a bit of optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells through light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics has certain advantages over optogenetics.
Light is directed to the brain under study by means of light fibers. Low-frequency ultrasounds, on the other hand, easily penetrate the cell, so that ultrasound can be passed through the skull.
"We believe that gene therapy and viral therapy can be used to expose human nerve cells to ultrasound signals in a clinical environment in certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
According to the investigator, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture devices — on your doorstep!
Advertising is a disgrace to the British arms trade.
Watch Amnesty International's anti-arms fair video.
Scary killer missiles!
Leg irons breaking ankles!
Drink bombs!
Remote tasters that cause unacceptable pain but do not leave any marks!
The happy sound and drawings clearly reveal that this ad of the world's largest state fairs is a barodet. The video is produced by Amnesty International and is designed to highlight the British government's attempt to sell weapons to repression governments at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) fair, which is held at the ExCel Centre in Docklands, London.
More on the subject: DSEI weapons fair: authoritarian governments arriving in London
There are also posters for bus stops and subway wagons that require a second look.
"An important announcement: do you move on the metro from 15 to 18 September?" The notification resembles the announcements of the London metro. At the end of the metro line on the other side there is a picture of the tanker.
"In September, a number of arms dealers will arrive in Docklands, and customers will be asked to help stop the weapons fairs."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists whose work was presented at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters throughout London with a six-pound "advertising space hacking package" with six-hole keys that allegedly reach about a third of the world's bus stop commercial posters.
Transport for London is not laughed at by poster vandalism.
One of the ruin ads of the Special Patrol Group.
According to the Cruel Designs curator and the professor of Essex University Gavin Grindon, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political work to the public outside the galleries.
The artists have noticed that social influence through art requires that art be brought into the real world. Many people move to work with protest activists.
One of the anti-weapon posters greets public transport users on the subway.
Amnesty video has been watched on Facebook more than 100,000 times a day. It has been designed without compensation by VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the artist have also done their work without compensation.
VCCP's artistic director, Matt Lever, was admiring the absence of mass advertising and an empty point in the ExCeL event calendar, and he realized, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to get tired of a more realistic, shady business video, but bright colors and animation attract more attention."
"They have done a wonderful job and helped us to bring up fairs where illegal torture equipment is traded," says Amnestyn Tom Davies.
"Now, the government must take action and ensure that torture instruments are not illegally traded at our doorway."
But perhaps the most creative gift of the weapons fairs is shown in the exhibition halls in ExCeL, where exhibitors take advantage of the great circular expressions of their merchandise.
In his press release, Saab announced a U.S. Army order for "portable AT4CS RS."
The product includes a "specialized warhead that effectively penetrates the target."
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for those living in student housing
I moved to a student apartment 11 years ago. I was an innocent 19-year-old and still believed in barettes and moral relativism. Only now I remember the intense smiles I provoked, and countless, long complaints about others.
The most important lessons can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving to a housing is the least of all arduous experience and the worst of it is shocking.
It's easy to talk: you're telling everyone what you're from, what you like about Corbyn and why you don't really hate or love Marmite, because it's just yeast, hahhahha, I'm in my room.
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others to breathe — show your interest and ask other questions.
Questioning will guide the discussion and help you find people you like and people you don't talk to even when your eyelashes are on the lights and these people share the extinguishers.
Give the others some space.
The private rooms often function as drinking spots, cinematographers and general residences, but the private room is also the place where they dress, starting with their underwear.
More about the subject: Don't even think about combining dating and university studies
For the Introverts, the university is a tough place.
A private room should be a place to calm down. However, many dormitories have a social culture where they wander from room to room and form lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return.
In this environment, it is not possible to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to get out of here so I can recharge the energy I used by dating you."
Try to see if one of your fellow students is exhausted from social contact. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was a guy in my own student apartment who thought that the door that wasn't locked meant that he was welcome in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies appropriately when the bake is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50-year-old, a little strange case: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I bake something small for you. Smile when I'm curious about your personalities."
Homemade treats are a great way to make new friends.
Your college friends are forced to talk to you, and thanks to a tasteful surprise, they can have a positive picture of you.
This, of course, requires reasonable bakery.
If you serve poor flour, sugar, and fat cooks, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Cooking food is also a common failure in student housing.
Of course, stealing another chicken is stealing, but can you drop a drop of someone else's milk can?
Always make sure of the owner of the milk can.
You'll probably get permission, even if the milk quote is the owner of the can.
I understand very well that it is annoying for someone to take care of something from you. However, try to deal with it as adult as possible — unlike my own study partner who put laundry in her milk for punishment for milk thieves.
She's in jail now.
Don't make any noise when other people try to sleep or push.
It's not just because it's polite, it's also worth remembering that every man digs a hole...
In my own dormitories, a girl asked the next room resident to lower the volume of music, for it was three o’clock in the morning, and she had a exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased his volume.
When I finally shut up in the next room, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours, went to the exam for three hours, left the music in her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm?
And wouldn't it be weird if you thought that your college date was your future mate, that you would start dating, that you would divorce and have to see him every day, and that you would lose the right to meet your mutual friends with him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, and if a student partner isn't the only one who's right, try to control it.
If you notice at the moment that someone has forgotten their key to a room whose door is not locked, the limit of tricking and bullying is more volatile than you might think.
It's a good joke, but it's one that's gonna get better in a minute.
The hiding of an object may be valuable and fun, but no one's room should be confused with toothpaste and sampoolla.
The door of the other room can be locked and dropped in a glass of water, which is placed in the freezer, but do not put anyone’s things on the roof with a blue sticker a few more times.
Racist attack on the residence of foreign students in Kite - The house planned as a reception center was snuffed out in Salo
A racist attack was carried out on Kite in North Karelia on Saturday morning at the home of foreign students.
Contrary to what the police have told us earlier, it is not accommodation facilities for minors seeking asylum, but bed spaces for foreign students already in Finland, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher of the People's College of Kite Evangeline.
The windows and walls of the accommodation facilities of the National University were swept with racist signs, such as the hakarists, and a metal object had been thrown through one of the accommodation windows," says the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, the responsible teacher of social security training of young people at the National University, the building under the influence of vandalism was estimated to have ten people at the time of the attack.
"There was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some could be elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
People from 12 different nationalities are housed at the National University.
They have already been students in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minors.
All the people in the messed-up building have a status.
Some are studying in adult basic school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying in Finland," Luukkainen says.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Eastern Finland police are investigating the attack as an act of harm and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukinen, an information conference was held for students on Monday, with the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic in here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for the past ten years, and this is the first time that something like this happens," Luukkainen says.
According to the lockman, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men were suspected to be the makers, and they had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think this is the head of the Youth weekend, when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," Luukkainen says.
Salo also has a hospital planned for the reception centre.
The case happened last week.
This was reported on the MTV website on Tuesday night.
There was a hakarist drawn on the wall of the hospital and written in English "You are not welcome".
There's been a report of a crime to the police.
Revision 15.9 at 16.02 Revised incorrect information provided by the police on the age and status of the people living in the building.
The state will put an end to the Y-train for the Karelian... passengers in their misery, "excellently idiotic"
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepor Karja will cease to run in March.
The news upset the passengers on the beginning of the night of the train in Helsinki’s main railway station.
In particular, the drive down strikes the Suntiians, said Torbjörn Bengtström, a municipality.
Very idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and people in work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This cannot be dependent on anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says on the HSTV interview video that he'll come with a tractor to the capital.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains running on the main track shall be connected to the new R-line.
Purola's station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusula are out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes to which the Ministry will purchase train traffic during the following contract period.
The contract period will change at the end of the year and there will be routes to be terminated throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in autumn will be later approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
The Siuntio Bengtström considers that the State’s train surgeon is a short-sighted activity.
We make the same mistakes we have made before and we repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there will be repentance.
The Y train is also used by people other than the Raaseporians and the Siuntians, because it is fast and crosses several stations.
Annina Pöyryä, in Espoo, was upset by the fate of those travelling further from the city area.
"It's very bad for those who have to plan their journey again," he said when he was in pain on the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
There must be a new train connection to the beach track, which will replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, or take it all the way to Kirkkonum.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to find out different options and their impact on the level of service and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y train in about a million years, of course, much more than that.
The R line on the main track will skip two stations.
On the other hand, in Ainola and Sauna Kalli, the number of trains will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuru and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinajoki.
The Pieksämäki Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkus route.
Trains will be reduced on the Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu routes.
More than half a million trips per year are made on a daily basis, while the total number of journeys purchased by the Ministry is around nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring annual savings of 12.3 million to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the Relativity of Capital: "Marx is worth getting to know"
The crisis in the world economy has brought to the surface the capital of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work, published in 1867-1894, to write in the book The timing of Marx's capital, known as the former President of GDP, Yrjö Hakanen, today.
"He will be taken more seriously now than he has been for a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and increasing penetration into all sectors of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved to be amazingly far-reaching.
The list of books based on the Kääsen-seminars organised by Hakasen also contains Professor of Aalto University, the respected financial participant Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx's current "year and forever".
However, the former CEO of the Department of Business Research and Industry is not Marxian, is it?
No, not at all.
Korkman says on the phone that Marx is not considered to be a current economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are isolated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary expert.
"The usual concept is that the history of the brain tells of the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It's true that Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
We are talking again about Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of the technical upheaval," Korkman analyses.
But what the government should decide tomorrow will not help Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
Still, Mr. Marx thinks Korkman should get to know him.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't read," says Korkman.
"The Maoists and Trotskys and other sects hated capitalism, but more of each other".
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political burden of years ago.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's thinking world, like other classics," says Korkman.
The UN demands war criminals in Sri Lanka
The UN demands the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the civil war in Sri Lanka, reports AFP.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 was published on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report blames both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as Tamils for war crimes.
The civil war in Sri Lanka is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
There are no precise data on the number of victims.
In particular, the large-scale attack by the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, and the UN report demands.
The Sri Lankan armed forces report blames torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which were victims of as likely a man as women.
According to the report, rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children to fight.
According to the report, both parties have committed murder.
On Wednesday, Sri Lanka replied that it intended to organise the investigation itself, but did not intend to allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice because foreign judges.
In the yo-test of England, we were able to redistribute social media
On Wednesday a long foreign language was replaced by the majority of students in the autumn.
More than 16,000 pilots tested their English skills.
It was possible to write the material in the experiment, even in social media.
Based on our own experiences, we needed to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of 150 - 250 words in English could be addressed to the operator of the online advisory column.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelia resting chair.
She had to ask for advice on how parents could also look at things for young people.
There were four subjects in total, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them", assesses the third topic of Porvoo's Swedish-speaking high school English lecturer Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was only a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic was, according to Lybeck, quite nice.
It was supposed to write a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school we've been practicing writing speeches," says Lybeck, and evaluates the whole experiment as "almost normal".
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English test was used to answer questions about texts, such as adaptation of the summer birch to climate change and handling of large data masses.
Some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when there will be a second domestic or Swedish or Finnish test.
In high school, the test is organised normally, so the expression of the employees does not affect it.
The Student Qualifications Board invites testers to find suitable connections in time to get to the trial.
Additional time can be given if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
In Oulu, a trade was robbed with a gun.
In Oulu on Wednesday morning, the store was robbed in the city of Kello.
According to the police, the mugger was dressed in dark clothes and in a masking commando.
He's normal and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
They're investigating this as a heist.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protestors in Helsinki - support units from other parts of Finland
The protest against the government's operating decisions will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, predicting the police.
According to preliminary information, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akaka and STK alliances will meet at the railway station at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The police at work, on the other hand, have the task not only of carrying out the alarm and other police activities but also of ensuring that the giant expression is smooth.
Roads leading to the railway station will be closed off from motor vehicles for approximately 9.30 to 14.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed into the area.
From the Hakaniemi direction traffic is cut off from the Kaisaniemi traffic circle, from the west direction to the Mannerheiminti.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
For now, at least it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand on the police business case.
According to Kujala, support units from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki due to the demonstration.
The police won't tell us the exact scout.
"A little bit is coming, but as a rule, we'll be fine on our own," Kujala says.
The police are calling for the avoidance of private cars in downtown Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic hub extends from Hakaniemi level to its core.
Standby traffic is expected from morning until early evening.
With protestors from other parts of Finland, there are also many order buses coming to Helsinki.
They won't be released to the Railway Sentire.
The buses are basically a little far away.
The end of the trip will then have to walk to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The expression also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the police point of view, there's a positive side.
The question of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at these large gatherings, is now partly self-sufficient.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policy may be coming to Helsinki.
The police expect the expression to be smooth.
People are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are reasonable and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations will also be held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's expression of mind is unusual in many ways - do you remember these strikes and expressions of mind?
The big expression organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and extraordinary in many ways.
For example, there is no very good reference point in Finnish political history, says Professor of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä emeritus Martti Siisiinen.
It's no wonder the Ay movement protested.
If it didn't, it'd raise your hands in front of the government," says Sisäinen.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the Finnish corporate tradition - and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough grips are missing contract law.
There are a lot of features here that really try to get the ay movement on its knees.
At the same time, the ay store has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the Ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
The new is now the sharp division whose expression leads to the presence of one whose ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed from all over Finland expressed their views at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you're looking for a reference point for a Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostoristai, which was organized in 1993, says Siisiinen.
In the middle of the deepest depression, Murrostorstai collected 20 000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon's (central) government tripped from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish government and the employees’ organisations had never been as bad as they were during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the government's relationship with the Ay movement may be even worse than in the times of the Murrostorst.
Besides, the Finnish bourgeois government is now in power, says Siisainen.
The current government coalition is still so interesting that it is so tightly right-wing, despite the speeches made by the basic Finns.
There were certain elements of the old labour movement at a time of sharpness.
Several thousand protestors are expected to be present on Friday.
The expression also stops public transport and possibly closes day care centres and schools.
Although the expression does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the biggest for many years.
In recent years, approximately 300 demonstrations have been organised annually in Helsinki.
They're from the side to the side.
Traditionally, the protests of the Finnish Ay movement have been quite peaceful, even though the practices have been tightened up in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law-abiding.
Proclaimers try to avoid harming or destroying property, says Siisinen.
But at the end of the 1990s, there were new winds.
The culture of demonstration changed.
EU membership upset farmers to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on them.
The firemen strike lasted three months in 1998.
Among other things, pilots and air traffic controllers also had outstanding strikes.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strike of the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power and power strike in 1977.
Seventy thousand metal men participated in the metal man strike.
The strike was suspended with the proposal of the Conciliation Committee after seven weeks of the strike.
Metal men received a 16% raise.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused electric shocks all over the country.
In March 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people, many of whom were made unemployed by the recession, met at the Parliamentary House to express their support for the work.
Firemen strike for three months in 1998
Firemen's strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were forced to lay eggs while farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
One of the slogans was "Sopera teaches, the EU ends".
For Espa, the farmers sprung tons of snow.
The EU Summit in Helsinki in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn hays in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses strike for about a month in 1995.
Last time, they had been in strike in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marked by a few deaths during the strike.
The strike and the mass redundancies of the nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass withdrawal finally speeded up the negotiations.
Doctors strike in 2001
"Doctors in strike - forcing" was the slogan of strike doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted five months and led to a lively debate on how the attacks could jeopardise patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the Move in 2013
Some 5 000 students marched for student support in Helsinki from Senate to Parliamentary House in 2013.
The Central Criminal Police will find out the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for assistance in the investigation of the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees near the German border in Aisterheim.
It is not known whether the truck was potentially on its way to Finland.
Everyone in the truck was in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility are at the scene of the event in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling on a truck in Austria became more fatal.
It seems that all 71 passengers on board at that time died by suffocation.
According to the broadcaster who first told us about the cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish public limited company.
The company carries out restaurant activities, for example, and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
Two Iraqiisms have been arrested for smuggling human beings in Austria.
The captain who beats the refugees, the former drug dealer and the subversive businessman... the story of five smugglers.
The sublime king of smugglers, the violent boat driver, the stylish missionary and the self-respecting cab driver.
For example, such people carry out trafficking in human beings into the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci at the University of Trento have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and the book Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the hips of trafficking in human beings, put forward proposals for solutions, and present smugglers from different levels of business.
HS will introduce five of them.
I'm gonna beat the hell out of them right now.
The Lighting Islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for a summer visit.
On behalf of their location, the islands are also excellent for smuggling, as the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 km away.
Due to comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the captain who burns in the chain, and the father of six children.
The islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fishermen are more profitable in transporting people.
That is what Emir has done on his blue, ten - foot - long wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat's full, it's got 40 people.
For one trip, Emir will make some €8,000 after the expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for customers all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until again, with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the island of Kerennna in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he can see.
Food is given in such a way that the customers are just about to survive.
The accommodation costs about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We'll go to the water at midnight with a light extinguished.
The first night is driven away from the islands, then stopped, waited for the day, and then drove to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and passengers cry and vomit in waves of 20 metres [20 m].
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats up his clients, and at least he claims to beat the sounders to death.
In the book, he tells us that when the police were nursing him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I took the customers one by one from the neck and threw them overboard," says Emir in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of Sahara.
I'm told he's gonna have to assault his countrymen for this.
I'm gonna beat the hell out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge here immediately.
He's a regular cab driver.
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaša, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good. The starter engine's pulling out the last of it, and anyway, he's seen his best days.
The most important thing, however, for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving at all and is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaša is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
There is a centre for asylum seekers next to the village, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests surrounding the centre, men travelling without their families are housed in tents, bearings, and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who have not submitted an application for asylum to Serbia for a reason or for another reason.
Some also reside in private homes, but it is a public secret.
Among the hunters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of border crossings and weekly walks on a difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When you finally arrive in the Bogovaša area, the great hub for human smuggling, people are tired of death.
Goran’s rideers are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqis and Kurdishs.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their things once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to compromise.
That's what Goran doesn't like.
Stupid fool all the way.
First, for example, 300 euros will be agreed, then they will put it down to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran points out that he's a nice and good-hearted man.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says that he is working cheaper than the others and that he is going to charge only EUR 50 per person from the border with Hungary.
There are three hundred kilometers, most comfortably on the freeway.
They say they're asking for a triple or a quadruple price.
Goran earns about EUR 50 000 a year.
It is not a large amount for the smuggler, but in Serbia it is quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not carry migrants 12 km closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran does not care: he knows the ways and the shortcuts and takes his rides a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and swings away.
At the Work of Grace
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called Missionary, and that's not just a nickname.
Indeed, he has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda, where many believers who fled the Congo, and a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees that he's doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber ribbon of white under his underpants is elegantly squeezing under his low waist.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV, and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The client calls from one of the five telephone numbers of the missionary.
He advises us to arrive at the border in the morning, to hide the money vistaly, and to drift into the midst of traders crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seekers or refugees, the Ugandan authorities must be informed that they come from, for example, the war zones in North Kivu and that they have had to flee their home for violence.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the missionary arranges a new identity for the client.
The old I.D. will be destroyed and replaced.
That's what helps the Missionary's contacts with the Ugandan police.
The customer is then referred to the same place as the real asylum seekers go: asylum procedures, NGOs, and finally the UN refugee organisation to the UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He invoices each portal separately: lodging an application to Ugandan police costs about EUR 100, managing documents to the humanitarian organisation about EUR 150 and the migration process, for example, to a European country of EUR 4 500-7 000.
Foliota and ice cubes
Tom is a beginner smuggler, a former drug dealer.
Four-and-a-half Irishmen patrol the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He has an Afghan, French taxi driver, and dozens of truck drivers living in London who may not even know they're in the private transportation business.
At night, Tom and the cab driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the center of Calais.
They're driving the A26 motorway and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for organising illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been sitting here for seven years because of drugs.
The taxi will stop, Tom and his customers will run across the freeway to the resting place where the drivers will sleep before they continue across the channel to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck to make sure it's on its way right to England, not to the Netherlands, for instance, cut the cover's safety wire.
You have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's involved, but that's when it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in an aluminium foil, similar to the one wrapped around a roast or an oven potatoes in the kitchen.
It should prevent a police thermal scanner from detecting a hideout.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place, hoping that there will be no sudden lightning passengers driving before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous smugglers.
The Upporian Turkish has been called the champion of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, who controls the sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money at hand.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship-wreck: Turkish ports are said to be renting pleasure sails to take Americans or European families to comfortable tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, ships will be loaded full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who will first be transported from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe at sea.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls until it is time to leave.
People get stuck in minivans and drive somewhere along the coast.
They're told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, you must board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden under deck for the entire journey.
The maritime guard can only observe how deep the ship is swimming, as no other sign of the crowd is visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers excavate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive about 53 000 euros for one luxury ship trip.
He does not handle practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other smaller factors to do the work for himself.
During the summer, at least hundreds of transports are organised and Küçuk makes millions of dollars.
He is believed to have bought a country through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company, and more than a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçuk was arrested in 2011 with a representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
After that, apparently, he's gone.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: Death's Travel Agency book will be published here, not next week.
In his book, the American Olympics reported his illness and becoming a prostitute
The new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 150,000 - foot [1,500 m] racer, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published breaks from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in excellent condition and ran for the second best time in the race.
At the finals, however, he panicked.
At the beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his leading position with a manic run.
However, 150 metres before the finish line, his powers ran out.
He collapsed onto the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the finish line, and Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later, it became apparent that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself experienced tremendous pressures of success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of having money for sex with foreign men.
He also overreacted his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's tax was EUR 450 an hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury life.
One explanation of Favor Hamilton’s becoming a prostitute was also that he needed the same adrenaline spikes as he had been competing in sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner was revealed at the end of 2012, when the Smoke Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 metres in the world’s statistical unit at 3.57.40, but remained the last of Sydney’s Olympic finals.
The world champion was thrilled when the alliance put the Norwegian skier under control: "From the back of the head"
The Norwegian skiing king, Petter Northug, has exceeded the limits of suitability for at least one of his colleagues.
Like last year and last autumn, Northug and the Norwegian Ski Union have reversed the sports agreement.
Although the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for the multiple world champion and the Olympic winner.
The Norwegian Ski Union decided to exclude Northug from the world cup of the coming season.
The decision was awarded to the double world champion, Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the alliance put the ski resort under control.
"Thank you for pointing the spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union's sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Union and Northug is about money.
I think Northug would like to be part of the country team so he can promote his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that also cares for future generations and does not give one athlete in the salts.
At the same time, he recalled that the Union has given Northug financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a completely different set of rules than just because he has the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release, which assured him that he wanted to play sports in Norwegian colours next season in the world cup and then in the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six MM medals in his career, two of which are gold.
He was in Falun last winter in a team that won the gold of the message.
They also celebrate the shield day of the pastors in the Nordic countries.
On the 25th of September, there will be moves in various restaurants and shops, which have been granted a shield by the Cook translators.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of food know-how and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and to raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of a high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but the top restaurants audited and classified by an impartial operator are located around Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the visibility of the turtle restaurants and the organization.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in the restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the Old Town Restaurant participates in the turtle day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has therefore been decided to make the event one of the most important international events of the organization, which will take place in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhahook magazine: Appealed to the Chancellor of Justice for the establishment of the Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre on the premises of Kauhava ex-equipment currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the area is still permanently located in critical infrastructure during the crisis, which is at the disposal of the Defence Forces and its collaborator, Finland's Special Networks Ltd.
According to the Kauhahook magazine, the investment of the reception centre in the same building as the private person would constitute a significant safety risk which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Aviation School, the effect of which has also not been clarified in the preparation of the reception centre, the magazine.
The case states that negotiations have been held over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the outcome of any foreign operator to the airport.
The matter has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistön (ps.) and the Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
The private party notes to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about the principle of opposition to the reception centre, but about the fact that the planned location in the former military area is wrong.
The City Government of Kauava dealt with the reception center case last Monday.
Niistö: the situation in Syria reflects Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The administration means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, and Niinisto commented to journalists in the evening after meeting the presidents of all the parliamentary parties with their official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, concerns about the management of the refugee situation brought together all participants.
He appreciates the fact that the Finnish Government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges
According to the Moisture, the situation in Syria, as well as the actions of Russia and the United States in the region, can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
The Niistö is hopeful about the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, that is, the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the current tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to the Moisture, the NATO issue was also addressed in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the situation in the labour market.

Media Researcher: Sipilä takes a high risk
According to Sipil, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are one of the other channels.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told journalists in the Parliament.
The Sipila did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches become a repeated practice.
According to Sipil, speeches may not always be conveyed on the Yle Canals in the future.
If other channels report as channels, we'll see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires television and radio speech to be given to citizens.
This dossier, which is being discussed, is quite complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 both on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Arena.
♪ Takes a big risk ♪
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s TV talk will not tell us about a more general inversion of the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more strictly into your own hands and to refuse to discuss questions in the public debate?
I recall Mr Soin's recent comment that he does not follow the agenda of the media and does not allow it to define itself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters are not linked.
Bõivunen understands that the commercial media is angry with Sipilä's announcement.
It'd be weird if the media didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not announcements in democracy.
The role of the representatives of the media is specifically to ensure that no political agendas are adopted.
According to the birch, television is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, the pig should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations.
Is there more that we've already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in different ways or in different words, or say something new?
Böivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, then it must be wondered why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an extraordinary time.
In that sense, if this is not a special situation, it is a routine speech among others, it is a great risk.
The danger is that Yle will be labeled as a communication between politicians or parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or general policy.
♪ A smart bet ♪
In the future speech by Sipilä, what the Prime Minister does not say is also important, the media researcher stresses.
In the evening, we should look closely at what Sipilä is missing and where not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
Six states that TV speech is a clever bet from Sipila, because it allows him to bring his own view out without a gravel voice.
This will lead to a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The wing passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media will misinterpret something from the speech because more precise questions cannot be asked.
According to the Six, it's very important how Sipilä is on TV, whether or not it's sweating, if your hands are shaking.
He compares Sipila to the father figure, who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can make a good presentation, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to communicate something, because in this man, as if he were speaking directly to another person.
This type of activity is regularly practiced by Obama (President Barack of the United States) and partners.
Very exceptional.
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to be truly exceptional to the citizens.
According to him, it has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister would like the Finns to be in agreement with the blackmails ahead.
Wage organisations will organise demonstrations and strikes against government actions on Friday.
Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give a speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, allowing the speech to be discussed.
SDP President Antti Rinne (sd.) again states that he is challenging Sipilä's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
Soon to be six months from the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on a run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time he was found.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Inland Finland Police Department also confirms the case for the evening magazine.
He went out to play at 4:00 this afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
My dad says thank you to all the people who helped me find him.
Thank you for those dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed nearly 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star is disappointed in the violent wildness of young people:
Makwan Amirkhani published a video on Facebook, which especially appeals to young people from immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani spoke out against the street fighting of young people.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arriving in Finland at the age of five, has so far won both his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani tells me he received a message asking me to look at an Instagram account.
Videos have been downloaded in which young people fight with extremely violent grips.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed in young people's wildness.
26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking people on the ground, sitting on one side and blindly hitting them without thinking about any of these consequences when you make videos like this, and Amirkhani is updating.
It's hard to defend.
Some of the young people on the videos have an immigrant background.
According to Inspector Jarmo Heinonen, both immigrants and young people from Finland have downloaded fighting videos to social media.
It's the fact that you're fighting all over the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani, a Turkuan, reminds us.
Amirkhani recalls that there are sites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have come to an enormous extent.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you now.
You should remember that you're still in a foreign country and you're going to be a pretty long guest here.
That's a slightly different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirchani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get hit by some kind of racism, you're gonna have to blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You guys are making me hate that I don't like.
You've got some pretty bad things going on here, and you're not gonna make them any better, Amirkhani.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Lauri Lyly, Chairman of the SAK, says on Twitter that the employee organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on the St.T.K.'s proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the HRC organisation told the government that it would present its own proposal to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.
Mr Fjäder, President-in-Office of the Akkaan, believes that the Government will accept the proposal if SAK, STK and Akaka are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest employee organisation SAK soften its previous position.
In turn, Lauri Lyly, Chairman of the SAK, made a very brief comment on the matter on Twitter.
Mrs Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open up the labour market lock" and that, instead of coercive laws, agreements concluded by active parties are needed.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to SAK.
In the past, Sipilä cut off the negotiations on a social agreement when SAK refused to commit to the 5% productivity gap.
Comment: The big demonstration threatens to break through - "It feels a little funny to put on a fist"
It feels a little funny to put on a fist if you already have a piece of paper in your pocket, Pekka Tiinane.
The atmosphere varies from side to side in the employees' camp.
Is it to call the government back, or to make a deal with it?
On Monday, the Allied Directors of the SAK broke out holy hatred for the government of the Republic.
All of Finland was threatened to shut down.
Well, that's what spread to the grizzly.
The OAJ teacher trade union threatened to close schools and day care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ withdrew: none of the schools or day care centres are completely closed.
On Wednesday, Mr Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the CWC, appeared at conciliation.
He explained that he had kept in touch with the government and that he had prepared the alternative proposal required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) as a 5% productivity gap.
Mr Sture Fjäder (Cook), President of the Akava, immediately rushed to announce that his paper was already ready.
At first, the SAK office didn't even hear of a yard.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when, on Monday, the federal leaders told us to put the country on a stand.
Finally, however, Lyly stated that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to deal with the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity gap as a target.
No wonder Palola's STK has a good relationship with the Sipilä government.
The right hand of the Palace, Director of Social Impact of STK Jukka Ideus, used to be a special assistant to the central prime ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
The fire described that the government's ay-knowledge has been improving all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took a little away from the Finnish stoppers, whose foreplay was the ACP Marko Pieainen (sd).
It feels a little funny to put on a fist if you already have a piece of paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18:00: Added information on Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Sergei Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
According to Sergei Naryshkin, the President of the Russian Duma, Mongolia is better than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in Ulan Batori, the capital of Mongolia, where Narysh also gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July Festival.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had been forced to flee the European Union, to a meeting - something that the President had set out to remind journalists of.
We believe that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again. Narysh also stressed the news office in Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where he had been prevented.
The sanctions are political suicides from the EU, the Naryshk Proclamation.
The Russian delegation reached Mongolia, so Narysh also continued to poke Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed with constructive and positive results, unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Narysh has also met Ilkka Kanervan (cok), who leads the meeting in Ulan Batori, which according to Russian media has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "Paints in tight"
Tappara and Clasp continue today in Hakametsa for bull days when both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipates that today there will be no actual festival of goals in Hakametsa.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to pick up the 3-2-prolonged victory of KalPa.
The rise was masculine, since last season's silver group was at its worst out of two goals.
The lock was more powerful on Tuesday.
The Raumaan catch was a round zero point, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any are playing the same game as last year, Clasp-scraper Janne Lahti anticipates settings on the club's website.
It's a playoff nightmare for the Irons.
In fact, during the previous two years, the Tappara has just dropped in the middle of the final series of the Clave.
A decisive seventh match has been required on both occasions.
Last season, the Clave took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three by and past.
There are no major changes in the compositions of the groups except for goal guards.
Both the cashiers who rejected last night will be on the cashier's shift today.
With the goal of killing Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Bearhus, and between the lock-tops Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
View: A bad play on an ace
Toivola, the sports director, wrote a follow-up that was not suitable for the main coach Rautakallio, wrote by Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky film in which he himself played the main part.
The defendant sensually put together a series of heavyweights for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a great deal of sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola wrote a restless ashtray to Pori.
The anonymous and wooden pottery went astonished by everyone at the SM finals 2006.
The team was full of anonymous, but tough, underdogs like Rocky.
There were White Indians, Matti Pori and Pele Pelto.
In the fall games, the players dyed their heads red and cut the ironies.
Hopey became a blonde.
The great TV reporter, JP Jalo, called Coach Neumann.
The aces took the winning silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The writer, Toivola, believes that this period's novel works in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports executive has built a pottery on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been rotting guys in the distance like Rocky's pig carcases at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are earned in something other than pucking.
Toivola has forgotten that the main part of Rocky VI is Pekka Rautakallion.
Karri Stone has crucified the Iron League into Sean Connery.
The iron gallery is as clumsy a major performer as Connery would have been in the original work of 1976.
There's nothing in the Iron Rock but Rocky's nickname.
The philosophies of the Iron League do not include storming and small furniture.
He appreciates the hard game, but it's a different thing to play hard than a pig.
In the last season, Garret Stafford, the Ässiens, took a bullet in the head of Jere Karelian.
He got two or ten minutes from the judges, but the Iron League put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have those who deserve to play.
I don't accept such a game, and it's not part of the ace hockey, and the hot Iron League woke up after the game with the people of the Hundred.
This season's team is strangely built.
There's trains, there's veterans, there's cops, there's bad news.
There are practically no key men at the best age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the art shortage.
How much have you been able to influence player purchases, Pekka Rautakallion?
The events of the past period have an impact on procurement and unfortunately the market situation was rather limited, and the Iron Alliance responded diplomatically.
I'm gonna put a cop under the surface.
The 1953 Rautakallio model is known to be interested in moving to Toivola's place as a sports boss.
Men's contracts will end in the spring.
The ace balance in the three leagues of the season is equal to the number of goals of 1-6.
I didn't think it was worth writing a follow-up.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santa Claus's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband when she was a teenager, they wouldn't have had anything in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under her husband's guidance.
Yes, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She's been married to Tuukka Temose, an ex-bassist and director of Abilanna since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but for the first time, Olga plays under Tuuka's direction.
The role of Olga in the film You made a beautiful film about the early years of the Abilanta is the drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka plays and supports her son, even though her father Risto (presented by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be a sound of reason.
The more I have become acquainted with my true example of Sirka, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Touka for trusting me on the role.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the twin has come a lot closer.
They've met, they've spoken on the phone and they've been communicating.
The circus has helped so much.
We've been through a lot of different corners of their history.
Fortunately, the circus also understands that drama is a drama, and the truth may have to be a little colored.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Aussyland would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, it was a recession, and it was really tough.
There was a little chance that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells us that she had heard a lot from Tuuka about her youth even before the movie plans.
However, parents ’ stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you're doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from Tuuka, known as Heinola’s infamous skateboarder.
Olga was a regular and kind girl who wouldn't have had anything to do with Tuuka.
At most, she could have been secretly in love with him.
Olga says he's worked so hard with Tuuka over the last 10 years that a big joint project isn't afraid.
Everything's always been great.
Now the entire production team will go to Heinola for a month.
True, a couple living in Iti often plan to drive home for the night because of their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, only to ask which streets and when they will empty us.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive drama film in Finland
The budget of Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is EUR 17 million.
The shoots will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola begins filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Scifie film The follow-up of Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become the most expensive drama film ever in Finland with a budget of EUR 17 million.
In the past, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation, which is being done, will also rise after completion of Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over EUR 100 million.
The film by Timo Vuorensola and by Tero Kaukomaa begins in October at the AED Studios near Antwerp and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
I'm not afraid of the giant budget.
I've been so sick, I've been so loose!
I'm so relaxed about the file script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize that we're doing something we've never seen before.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to get this movie shown to the audience, he'll tell the evening paper.
Originally, 8-10 million had been planned for the film budget, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story.
However, 100 million could be inserted into the film because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now it's all turned so tight, there's no loose air.
On Wednesday, the film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a mass financing campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of 4-8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Son of a bitch or cool?
Big logos go back to their shirts
The trendmakers' fronts have recently been decorated with big logos.
Some time ago, a fashionable dresser avoided clear and large logos like Crocs on a console.
The branding of the hood or t-shirt was seen as a junta.
But times change.
Sport has become a real megatrend of fashion, and so have old, familiar sports fashion characters such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the cool wave.
And, as so often before, the funny and trendy line is waving: if something is right, it starts to turn into ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, that is, the fashion of tavis, where trendsetters surprised the most boring basic clothes as if it were a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of a grey basic college, the sweatshirt buried on the bottom of the closet, before which the manufacturer's logo appears, will be inserted.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas is also recognized by trackers, favorite team gaming shirts and New York Yankees hats have also made a return to the street fashion.
Now, Calvin Klein's logos are a cool detail.
The trend also seems to be moving from sports stamps to luxury brands.
For example, the front of Versace’s fall blouses makes it clear what brandy clothing is involved.
Would you be willing to introduce logos in your dress?
The Russian politician published the evidence: I was not stuck in the tank for hours!
It is argued that a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia's Arms Expo, which presented the Russian military industry's products, was held in 2015.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colourful claims that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to remove large-scale Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even published an image on his own public Facebook pages where he seems to be looking at the hatch of the armored vehicle in very good moods and, at least, on the basis of these images, it is not about getting stuck or angry.
It's all nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the armored armored wagon, but it was an assault armored wagon BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, Colonel, I have served at Ural.
I went in there, looked around me and came out in peace, and Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I wasn't stuck, and I really didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian army television channel that he wanted to see Russia's new technology in the exhibition because he was himself a professional soldier.
That's why I'm interested in what's inside the wagons, and I'm looking forward to our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And at the next show I definitely intend to visit all the tanks and all the storm tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the journalist who wrote the matter stupid.
One fool wrote, and everyone else kept repeating.
There was nothing like that.
I went in and came out.
I'm tall and ratty, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen, he said to the Russian sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photo of the alleged demise has been published, although a total of 50,000 people attended the arms exhibition in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started with a case of the Bloknot.ru site where Zotov was told that he was out of the tank hatch when he tried and threatened to shoot everyone around him if he didn't get away with it.
Later, the website Bloknot published a follow-up story in which the organisers of the exhibition told about what had happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his large size, simply stayed when he came out.
But he never sat there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Alexander Pisarevski Bloknot.

There has been a leak in the Kittilä mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand pool into its well.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the leak.
The pool contains neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water for the foaming process.
In general, the water is either re-used as process water or, as authorised, transported through a surface watering field to the environment.
The bleeding rate was estimated to be approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leakage water meets the current permit conditions.
That's all that was in the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been observed to cause structural damage to the dam structures of the pool.
The company tells us that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuopamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published by the IMF today largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation en routed Finland to comprehensive structural reforms to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contractual system and unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank’s main economic owner Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a great deal of message for government action, but on the other hand, there are warning words about what should not be too much cut.
These are, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to the economic message.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts a 0.4 per cent growth rate for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
Today, in its new cyclical forecast, Danske forecasts that growth will remain zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have had the most recent observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing slightly in the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
It has been possible to pay less attention to industrial confidence or to other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences are only a few percent decimals.
Nintendo, who recovers from death, appointed a new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, working under Iwata, who died of cancer in July, began her work on Wednesday, Nintendo told on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the game industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for launching a successful Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that was raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, assesses Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's mission is to bring Nintendo into mobile games, but it does not eat the company's bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that hundreds of children have disappeared annually.
Among other things, SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported this on their websites, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minors disappear every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, Senior Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants disappear "under country" per year?- A total of 156 minor asylum applications were made in 2013 in Finland.
They lost 9 of them.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196 and 11 of them disappeared.
The reason for this loss may be that it is clear from the examination that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue to deal with the matter in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will be found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were decided to drop out of the application because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last year, he says.
Is there an increase?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum from a single minor.
Overall statistics on missing minor asylum seekers do not yet exist this year, but the number of minors is known and has grown clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What will happen to those who have received the conversion decision?
Will they also disappear, for example, into the 'dark labour market'?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as enforcement of conversion decisions is the responsibility of the police, Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of Home Affairs Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unreported people who are trying to enter the country.
He's taken action.
At the EU Minister for Home Affairs, Orpo spoke on Monday about practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen is selling Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of the devices
The equipment used for television and radio production by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, the media pioneer who lost his ability to work due to the illness attacks is now on sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuto.net, which was once the most advanced equipment for professionals.
It's the first time I've ever heard of an online ad in the Iltamacasin.
Today, much of the equipment is left behind in technological development.
In the digital media world, TV shows for Betacam tapes are no longer filmed.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be people interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer that up-to-date, but it is also necessary for as long as there is an old generation of material that must be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of entertainers, collectors, and the designers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are trying to move away from their present Stormland home.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I've slowly started to invent and see what's left of the goods.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use of TV and radio equipment.
After recent strokes, it is clear that a man who has made a long career will no longer return to his working life.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are now being sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life work was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to the box store to pick up films and other materials from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to derail worse than thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Today, the drivers of the metro and trams decide whether to extend their efforts in connection with the demonstration of Friday.
The original plan was to stop the metro and trams only for the occasion of the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be up to you whether traffic stops all day long.
Mr. Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is great in the field.
Nocturnal and tidal surgeries are ardent to drivers, so the government plans to cut supplements are a source of resistance.
Horvonen wonders, however, that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop by Friday, public transport in the capital region is almost entirely stopped.
According to VR, trains do not travel between six in the morning and six in the evening on Friday.
There will be no local or long-distance traffic on Fridays.
Trains that left before 6:00 a.m. will be driven to destination.
According to HSL, most buses are left behind.
The ACP members are absent from work on Friday morning from 3 p.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday morning.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven, they will be driven by the driving force, thought by Pirkko Repo, the informant of HSL.
Repo says HSL can't tell you exactly which busses go on Friday.
The Wage Organisations will organise a big demonstration at Helsinki Railway University between 11 and 13 p.m. on Friday.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, says AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled under panic.
According to local media, Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas. The teacher thought a self-righteous watch was a bomb.
In Texas, Texas, 14 - year - old Ahmed Mohammed has been arrested since the teacher regarded the self-righteous watch he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to introduce his electronics activities to his output.
But one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation finally ended with the boy being taken to a youth detention cell in handcuffs.
At no point has Mohammed claimed that he had made the clock.
Yet it is still possible that the boy will be accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police had said the clock looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in police custody, but it was known to consist of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident happened last Monday and Moham media was punished for three days on forced leave from school.
His father is angry about the case, and the American-Islamic Council of the country is wondering whether the case is another evidence of Islam in the United States.
Great Britain - Director Labour refused to sing national songs
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is the enemy of the monarchy.
The criticism put forward by the right-wing press has also been shared by the representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, thought the Labour Representative Kate Green at the BBC's radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
At yesterday’s Memorial, the British Air Force pilots were respected in the battle against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official opinion and stresses his respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We all owe enormous gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood silently during the national song, and the opinion was highlighted.
Corbyn's election as a party leader has divided the ranks of the labour.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, ending austerity and increasing public spending.
For the first time today, Corbyn is due to appear in Parliament as a party leader in the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
When the week went by, Cameron was on Twitter choosing Corbyn as the leader of the party.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, your Prime Minister's advice in his own account.
The cause of the family death of Minnesota is still unclear. The father of the family was waiting for the trial.
The South Lake Minentonka Police have been investigating the family death of the Minnesota Greenwood family for a week.
The five - souled family was found dead in their home on September 10th, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
After he shot his wife and three children in the shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
According to this report, the police visited the house and found Short’s family dead in different parts of the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Millions of houses and a successful company
The South Lake Minentonka Police Chief Michael Sitar's case is still under investigation.
The motive for blood work is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In 2014, at the StarTribune interview Short reported that there are four million different visitors to the site each week.
I've been offered 50 offers over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe someday I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, in 2011 when Short’s family bought a crazy house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised at Zillow as a car collector’s dream: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also an adequate garage for eight cars.
Case pending
According to StarTribune, the father of the family was waiting for the trial.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various pre-preparation courses, had sued him for the comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Short’s website had not removed any pre-preparing comments, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short’s business.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffees
In addition, the owner’s trio was awarded at the therapeutic event with the Finnish hippos monthly horse owner’s prize.
It's great, Loiri commenting in a good mood on her honorary chart.
The festive Fabric Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist legend, Loiri, was still confused by the success of Fabrice Duo in the grand competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the success horse’s coach, Korpi, will find full employment while working with the horse.
The pekka will decide where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I keep my mouth shut, Loiri laughed.
"The greatest donation ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6.7 million euros) to Montreal Children’s Hospital.
According to the hospital press release, this is the biggest individual donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban and the Canadiens made an eight-year-old deal worth $72 million.
Subban’s donation is thus significantly higher than his $9 million annual contribution.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will receive a lobby with his name on it from the hospital.
The Canadiens players have, in the past, provided significant help to local hospitals.
A year ago, long-term Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a giant sum of money for the other city's major hospital that provided the hospital with a PET scanner for cancer research.
You can order a wife from a coffee shop in Japan for the night, serve only bikinis for food, and an essu on top.
The theme cafes are tough in Japan.
The market already has a goat coffee place, a chicken coffee place, a vampire coffee place, a fish coffee place, and now a wife coffee place.
It strikes the lonely, the social, and the hungry.
It's the Metro news.
You can order a wife or husband for the evening from the Tokyo Ore no Yome (my Finnish wife).
It's a waiter pretending to be a client's spouse.
"Parties" are selected from the list before coming to the cafe and he prepares and serves food.
She's up against the Essu and the bikinis, and the husband's on tight bike shorts.
The website provides all the information about the length and the weight of the wife’s application to the kind of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: attacks on car security began to take place
The Automatic Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in the sector, says Intel’s newsletter.
The panel is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will update the report on the basis of the results of the study carried out by ASRB.
The international ICT research and consultation company Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share network-based data.
We can and must improve the cyber security of cars, says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators for data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs approximately 52 000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS has been waiting for years as a moon riser.
Finally, the car is beginning to be in sight in Finland.
Ford released RS data now that the eyes of the car world are at the Frankfurt Car Exhibition.
Ford's new four-wheel RS speeds up by 2.3-litre, 350 horsepower motors in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
The price is also interesting by Finnish people, it is provisionally reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is now available for order, although the time when the first cars arrive in Finland will not be mentioned in the notice.
The popular brand, Kia, introduced two novelties at the Frankfurt Car Exhibition - such as the new Sportage and Optima
A new fourth generation Sportage is certainly more important by Finnish people than two new ones, with which Kia intends to catch a larger wing of the ever-growing street SUV market.
The new European design director, Gregory Guillaume, is more circular than ever before.
Between the axles and the outer dimensions, one centimeter has come here and the car splits the air more effectively.
The engine range is essentially unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo, which develops 177 horsepower, has been added to it.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance, as well as consumption, is reported closer to the entry for sale.
It will have to wait a little longer, as we will receive the new Sportage in spring 2016.
Even before the year changed, new Kia Optimats came to our country.
All of a sudden, the news doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of high-end buyers with better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher quality equipment.
Optimises equipped with 1,7-litre turbodiesel and 2,0-litre petrol engines are available.
Next summer, the speed will accelerate when Optima GT, equipped with a 2.0-litre turbo engine, arrives next to them.
At the same time, when it comes, Optima will start selling.
Chisu came back to the stage, and he'd come back, and he'd come back, and he'd come back, and he'd come back, and he'd come back, and he'd come back, and he'd come back, and he'
Singer Chisu will attend the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric blue pantsuit has a spectacular, open neck opening.
The costume is a beautiful demonstration of the band's waist of the singer star.
The whole is crowned with a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three - year break, a singer who became a mother has been punished with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will be one year old soon.
The singer published his first single album in August.
Back to the stage and getting up in front of the public after a long break is not really exciting for me.
I've missed everything I've done with music, the singer tells me.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release his new album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, you wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will.
Kim Kardashian's style of motherhood amazes me again - now I see the breast
True-TV beautiful Kim Kardashian gives a lot of stuff to talk about one after the other.
She presents her pregnancy stomach and bra in sexy clothes, last night at 1:00 a.m., when she left the husband's Kanye West gig with her sister, Kourtney Kardashian.
The black maternity dress is transparent to the breasts.
It exposes the skin-colored bras under the dress when the lightning lights shine.
Last time Kardashian dressed up in an Amazonic maternity home, she visited her friend for a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The costume was highlighted by black over-generation boots.
The third special maternity uniform is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when there was a pregnancy stomach on the show.
The tough laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to shorten the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary "Speaking Dolls", where Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths clean about model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar collected six hard truths from Leloup behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if in the previous season you had posed in the costumes of top designers, the new season begins again with castings.
And every season comes with new, fresh faces that compete with the crackers for work.
Models rarely have a place to call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take a year to stay in a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses host their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just one kind of weight loss.
An agent in New York may ask for a drop of pounds, but in Paris, they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is always a game of chance.
In fashion weeks, the models and designers are always together and act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks are over, the difference is a hoax.
The models want this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but the fact that everyone thinks that the work is just a presentation of clothes is a matter for them.
The models also want to be their own.
The work makes the models feel like they're actors who have a role to play.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
The models for the Tory Burch show last night.
In New York City, fashion weeks are currently being held, where designers will reveal their collections next year.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Assistant musician in the film
Roope Salminen will present Antti Lautala, the founder member of the band in a film based on the early years of the Abilanta Group.
The Lautala was founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but resigned from the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I've never wanted to meet the right Antti before the shoots, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly unknown to people from that group, so I think it's a good thing that I only learn his play style from the video.
I don't want to make an impression of a person.
A man piloting Roope Salminen and Dogs is not going to play.
The punk-mangers come with a man by nature.
In the "Stars, Stars" section of the punk, I'm sure many people saw the taste, as well as if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but we always go full.
The main actors of Tuukka Temonen, who played the bass between 1993 and 2004 were announced today.
A group of young actors who have become known to the band are still quite unknown to the general public.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temo Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a tip about her future laundry yesterday evening when she mysteriously told Snapchat that she was preparing for the most important day of her career.
Roope has already published yesterday in Instagram a picture of his new category, which he has had to make for the film.
Roope, seen earlier in mustaches and jaws, has shaved his face into silos and dyed his brown hair into black hair.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think in recent days about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees who are seeking to live in Europe.
Or should I tell you about it at all?
There is no need to speak about this, Mr Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR crisis group, advises psychologists.
Smaller children are worth protecting, for example, not letting them watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in mind and distress, he says.
However, if the child has come across or heard the news photos of refugees on television, it is worth talking about.
It is good to have a discussion about the child’s starting point and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fear of a child may be surprising.
They're not necessarily the ones a parent thinks he's afraid of.
You don't want to scare a kid in vain, even if you're being harassed and scared.
The younger child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the discussion, the child too will feel safe.
Bigger children are likely to encounter conversations about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to take matters into consideration with them if a child is to be considered.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with children, can wonder how our family feels about this.
In the end, though, do we feel that the world is a safe or secure place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from distress, if possible.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult things, the child will have a model of how to deal with the challenges in life.
This can be useful to him in the future.
Social Psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your children to help the weaker"
Out of your own powers?
You can still be a good parent to your child
It's hard to control the ballland that hits the vermo.
Perttu Pohjola was able to sand the Apila Pallosalama into a stun in the middle of the summer.
It only gave way to profits and number twos until the end of July the collapse occurred in the ravines of Tampere.
Since the slave was completely clogged, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered time from the vet.
The explanation for the extinction was found on the watch.
The horse had an infection of the throat.
The disease was not the least of the head, but it took two courses of medicine to overcome it.
Since the Apila Pallosalama had to be in a light exercise, the Nordic Republic says that he is positively surprised by the recent horse race.
It was the second SE in Turku after the Taruntuulu.
Apila’s Pallosalama was very under pressure from a time when it could normally only be driven for a few weeks.
Considering those things, the slight tendency at the end was understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a good competition made the slave sharp.
The horse’s violet must have moved on from it, and I hope it would have evened out.
Apila Pallosalama has been called humorous horses.
When it hasn't been fun, it could've thrown fat without disease.
On a good day, however, the Ori have been desolate by such lightning that the opponents have been amazed.
At short speed, rivals can't handle the ball bottom, from which even warm-blooded rides will come off.
In the hope of the North, Vermo has a fart.
However, it is a different matter how the Apilean Pallosalama agrees to do so.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it might stick under the boom of the starter car and stuff.
I hope the slave is calmer than he's leaving Turku.
Apila’s Pallosalama can also come from the bow while in good condition, and we’re going to drive it for victory, Coach’s permission.
That's why you can't get rid of useless iPhone programs.
Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future, but not all of them.
Apple is likely to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, says the CEO of the company Tim Cook Buzzfeed interview.
Apple’s iPhone contains a number of programs that are relatively rarely used: for example FaceTime calls, Journalism, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook says that removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple’s iPhone applications worked closely with other programs.
There are other programmes that do not work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating because the company doesn't want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Euro area inflation fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, or 0.1% year-on-year, with Eurostat reporting by the EU Statistical Authority today.
The rise in prices was driven downwards by lower prices of energy.
Eurostat thus revised its forecast of 0.2% slightly downwards from a few weeks ago.
In July, the rate of inflation was 0.2 per cent.
The so-called basic inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate of basic inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the EU-28 was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
Of the euro countries, consumer prices rose most, i.e. by 1.4 per cent, in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest by 1.9 per cent in prices.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the EU's Harmonised Index of Indexes.
Euro area inflation is still a persistent distance from the European Central Bank (ECB)'s target of a 2 % rise in prices over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
In the coming year, the rise will rise to 1.1%, with the central bank forecasting in its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Fed will try to blackmail monetary policy next.
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more certainly within three years after the country’s central bank Fed is again starting to raise its interest rates for a long time.
And on the financial market, the downfall begins before the next recession.
Fed has suggested that he will start the interest payments already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can hit the top of the clock by next autumn and as a course of financial markets before then.
Or at least this will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets work the way they have been used to - and if they react to the blackmailing of Fed's money withdrawals, as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been drawn by the German bank Deutsche Bank’s London market research strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in its extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed the Long-Term Asset Return Study study to its international customers last week.
The strategies that drafted the study and report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will start raising interest rates or what happens in the economy and in the market thereafter.
Instead, through the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, they present how the economy and the market have behaved in the past at and after the Fed interest payments.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at which key economic and financial market variables are now on the same or different model as at the time of previous interest purchases - and what might be the result.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more humanitarian condition to withstand the rise in interest rates than ever before in the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession may not be a year.
Over the past summer and early autumn, the leaders of Fed's monetary policy and its respective institution have suggested that the time has come to raise interest rates.
The first raise for more than nine years can take place already this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Management Committee meets to decide on it at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised his so-called Fed funds steering rate in June 2006.
At that time, the relatively regular, but at a time small 0,25 percentage points, which led Fed to raise its interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%, ended for exactly two years.
The financial market symptoms began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the USA, and one year later, the financial crisis broke into a global day of judgment.
The major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious difficulties in the financial markets and the real economy began at a slower pace than has typically occurred since the previous interest payments by Fed.
Similarly, the trials were then tougher and tougher than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have screened the rises and declines of the world's largest economies and financial market developments since 1950 and, in places, since the beginning of the 19th century.
They will report on Fed's interest payments and their economic and financial impact since the 1950s.
The fastest time to begin the recession is less than a year, most often less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The rate increase on the financial market has been completed within one to two years of the start of Fed's interest payments.
Since the beginning of the 1950s, the Fed has increased alternately and decreased its control rate by a dozen different cycles.
Each time is somewhat different from each other, and the coefficient is relatively limited in the review, so it is hardly possible to conclude anything for the impact of the subsequent interest payments.
The strategies therefore remind us that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
The interest rates are too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, even though the guilty may not necessarily be identified by decades of research.
But three things about the leaders of the crisis and the causes that have increased its destructive power, I believe, are somewhat undisputed:
1) In the 21st century, Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks in the world considered their steering interest rates to be too low for too long.
They were spotting the technocouple, and they grew the next one.
2) The debt accumulated in various parts of the financial and real economy over the decades and previously too high a level of debt increased even more due to the impact of central banks' overcompensation on monetary policy.
The largest debt bubble in economic history was born until then.
3) In particular, the madly cheap debt financing, which was almost packaged in the financial economy, increased the largest exchange rate bubbles in the economic history of most parts of the financial market from shares to shares in real estate, debt securities and commodities.
It is unlikely that there will be a very severe dispute that the rising financial market for ever more complex debt flows was in a rarely dangerous and unstable state of affairs when Fed and other central banks were driving up the interest rate.
The debt-based financial structures, however, did not last until after the interest payments had started and the cost of debt financing had risen.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis and were followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategies do not guess what will happen next, but give the subject of nucleus by mentioning, for example:
1) The Fed and other large central banks have now kept their monetary policy even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
( 2) Debt has not been madly cheap for a long time, as ten years ago, but at the very least, debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt burden on the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now, in various parts of the economy, the debt burden is more severe than before or before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity that has been issued at a lower and lower cost from central banks has largely remained on the financial market and has slowed down key securities and assets to the most expensive peak since or never before the financial crisis.
And not only are the strategies of the latian climate with warning signs on the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not recovered from the financial crisis and from the worst recession in decades to come.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but accordingly, the pressures and risks on the financial markets are disproportionately higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts to tighten his money supply tighter.
Perhaps the picture of Albert Edwards' future of Societe Generale's strategy is not as strange as it may seem.
For a long time, he has trained the Bank's international investor clients for the following full translations:
First Fed raises interest, then the financial bubbles break out, and soon it'll be time for Fed to turn off the financial pieces with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is planning to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed towards HP’s business service party, the company says.
HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., based on pcs and printers targeted at consumers in November.
HP’s workforce was highest in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records one-off costs of $2.7 billion (approximately €2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce 250,000-30,000 workers.
Consumers' reductions will remain in 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees will be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company reports that it has already balanced its business in such a way that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its business performance.
In the second year, the three most significant customers brought 65 per cent of the operating result.

Yle: Minister Berner has been a member of the board of the tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Tax Paradise Company.
According to Yle, the company's activities were linked to so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo company, which was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself says that he has filed a resignation notice in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to file a divorce notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed schedule, says Berner at the Yle interview.
Membership after merger
Through the Luxembourg company, the ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed.
Kährs is a floor manufacturer, which was merged with the Finnish floor manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served as a government of Karelia-Upoflor between 2010 and 2013 and after the merger with the government of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings go through a multi-port ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted membership of the Luxembourg company at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been in the government of the Karelia Upoflor owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was contacted with a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the capital benefits of the Finnish family company were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income of our Finnish companies' capital is taxed in Finland and that it was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership in the company is not subject to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in tax havens is due to the fact that Triton, the largest owner of Kährs, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
In Espoo Otaniemi, the first reception centre maintained by the company is opened for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 people already today from 6 p.m.
The number of seats can increase in the next week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will set up a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue College.
The activities are maintained by Luona Oy, which is particularly concerned with the production of healthcare and health care services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STK is preparing an alternative work-life tightening package
St.T.C. is preparing an alternative package for the government's work-related tensions.
The organisation also wishes to see other organisations of the employees' centres.
According to President Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing the price of work are then returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out to journalists during the meeting of the organization’s administration.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Business (EC) does not, on the other hand, have the capacity to debate.
Economicists of STK have calculated that the change in the government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated 30 million euros when the other half of the package is 2 700 million.
I do not know if the party is terribly keen to have a conversation if there is one relationship on the side of the hundred.
Palola: A constructive negotiating link
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has called for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to submit a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing reforms.
The Palola did not comment on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a connection to the government, and it has always been constructive of him.
According to Palola, the CWC at the STK field is a painful place, especially for Sunday supplements.
The organisation requires that the government withdraws from binding legislation to implement part of the blackmail.
According to Palola, the STK does not allow an alternative package to be prepared with the SDP that has been present.
Employees meet in Helsinki on Friday to resist the work-life tightening package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the wages of the first days of sickness are cut, the overtime is reduced to half, the Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced.
With regard to the STK, it is stressed that central organisations have called on employees to express themselves and have not intended to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder says thank you.
Mr Fjäder, President-in-Office of the Akava, thanked the Stek report on the preparation of the alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STK is now on the same lines with Akava, as an alternative model for government presentations has already been outlined in Akava.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
Mr Fjäder, President-in-Office of the Akava, hopes that the SAK, led by Mr Lyly, will come to prepare a presentation as an alternative to surgery.
Antti Palola's STK reported earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Akaka announced that it has long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate a 5% competitive leap by the government as an alternative to surgery.
Akaka has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long written an alternative model for government presentations.
We are prepared to look at the terms of service as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Akava lines, as STK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing a model for the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
On Thursday, 15 a.m., the Akava Bureau will take a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the common coal, the soles" playing bingo while Sipila talks tonight
University of Tampere Green Left
The Viva Bingo Cup of the Green Left of Tampere University for the evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional talks during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will exceptionally speak to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on the channels of Yle at 21.05 p.m. on Wednesday night.
When applying for the previous Prime Minister's speech, we must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio talk, which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the President and the ministers gave a number of radio speeches during the winter and post-war period.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen closed the train performers' strike with a television talk.
Single talk, monarchic meinink
Sipila's speech has been a source of criticism and conjecture throughout the day about what to do.
On Twitter, President Paavo Arhinmäki said that "The Sipilä could speak about the state of the nation in the parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, so that the speech could also be discussed".
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "one call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the SDP's Erkki Judgments condemned the "monarchist manners: the Prime Minister tells the people what's best for it".
Antti Rinne, President of the SDP, challenged Sipilä's dialogue: "A long six months of elections.
Not a single performance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What's @juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and will take about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it is commented on live by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EC CEO Jyri Häkämeis.
It has been criticised for giving Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it is part of the public service mission to promote the overall publicity of Finland, and that the director of Yle’s publications in the news of Ismo Silvo Yle.
Like Me in Tammeloi's day
The speech has also raised ridicules.
In the evening, the dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be combed and dressed for their best.
My mom puts on the prettiest vulture and my dad puts a tie on his neck.
At 9 a.m., we'll be quieted down to television as we used to at the time of the Tammels," wrote blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also tell in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens with millions of millions of millions who are hiding their capital, who are drawing up pardon laws for their other tax-circuiters and, at the same time, claiming to the people that it is necessary to cut when the state has run out of money?" says Pia Lohikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the University of Tampere Green Left Viva.
It has published the bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat, the same coal, living as debts, and the same team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21.05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: The Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to set aside al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer by which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have given up power, says President Martti Ahtisaari to the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian United Nations Ambassador proposed a plan that would allow al-Assad to move away from power in an elegant manner after some time.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
The Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent member states of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurk listed three points of plan to him in a bilateral debate: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition had to be contacted immediately, and the abandonment of al-Assad had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we are able to discuss it openly.
I told him what I was doing there, and he said sit down there, Martti, and I'll tell him what we need to do, the Ahtisaari will remember at the Guardian interview.
Diplomates do not comment
The island of Ahtisaari reports that he has passed Tshurkin’s message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate to the paper, but according to Ahtisaari there are no two words.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that the Al-Assad troops had already committed several massacres at that time and that the main opposition groups refused all the agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the British Foreign Ministry's Middle East Department, takes the view of Ahtisaari's speeches with hesitation because, according to his experience, Russia was at no point prepared to discuss the fate of Al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest part of the claim made by Ahtisaari is that Tshurk spoke with Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speech, I would have said that I would like to hear the same thing from President Vladimir Putin so I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even in that case, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's trick to keep the power of one of Al-Assad's supporters.
The refugee flow of our own actions
During the negotiations on the island of Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had died in the crisis in Syria.
According to the UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of the current year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own action.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we're paying the bill we made ourselves, the Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Organisation centre for asylum seekers with a knock-off to the Tornio
The organisation centre for asylum seekers designed by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the building of the tower’s cohabitation in the centre of the city.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better manage the refugee flow from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat announced on Tuesday that the Board of Governors would have already decided to present a school building as a status solution for the Ministry.
According to Sauli Höppinen (left), Vice-President of the Tornio City Council, this is not true.
When the entire council was not assembled and some of the crew wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite a council meeting to decide on the matter next Monday, he would specify to the STT.
There were 36 of 43 delegates at the local meeting.
The organisation centre was opposed by 13 delegates.
On that basis, you could expect the decision to be positive, says Hyöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and a rapid reaction was made.
It is estimated that 500 asylum seekers would be able to join the community at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is two hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense too, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä is still hoping for an alternative to blackmail in the labour market.
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä, halving the public holiday money would only deal with part of the government's aim of lowering the price of work.
However, the government will be happy to accept the alternative package if such agreement can be reached by the social partners.
Sipilä told the journalists in Parliament that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
Nor did he know how serious the organizations were looking for replacements for the cuts in the government’s work life.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, halving the holidays would be a way to act, because it would target almost all wage earners in contrast to, for example, the Sunday allowance cut planned by the government.
The social partners could agree between themselves on the operation of holiday money, because they are included in collective agreements rather than in the law.
On Wednesday next week, the government will report to Parliament on the pressure on working life in the form of a Government communication.
According to Sipil, the proposals made by the organisations should be known before this happens.
This is not the final end of the line, either.
The legislative work will then start to move, which means that the train is on the move and it will be more and more difficult.
We've got a lot of time.
It won't take long for such things to come, if there is a will, Sipilä put it in shape.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of the slopish and helatorist into unpaid holidays without reducing the annual working hours.
In addition, the wages of the first days of sickness are cut, the overtime is reduced to half, the Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced.
The reforms will be implemented as a forceful legislation through trade unions, which has raised strong criticisms.
As a result of these actions, wage and salary centre organisations are organising a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political attacks.
The Tohmajärvi Council approved the extension of the juice hall warehouse
The Tohmajärvi Board of Governors unanimously approved the extension of the warehouse of Nordic Koivu Oy, the hall of juice hall.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than the one originally mentioned.
Also, a busy schedule hearty.
It was also little wonder that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, an extension of the stock by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the financing will be decided at that time in the context of the interim report.
The agenda also included an investment of between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000, but at the meeting, technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be approximately EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis of the fact that it brings work and tax revenues to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays for the investment as a rental, Vesa Viistö (ps.) justified.
There is also a place for Karelian language in Joensuu
The city government relaxed its earlier position to bring the street sign of the Karelian language to the city centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the preservation of the herd’s tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it, and the Karelian language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastern Savon dialects.
Even after the new decision, no street sign in Karelian language will enter the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also ready for use on a case-by-case basis, for example, in information boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same attitude to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single-language municipality, the use of the Karelian language should also be given an open mind now that the multiculturalism lives and changes strongly even in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the entire forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can well be used in the region’s various marketing activities.
The derailment of train connections is cutting off the vitality of the province
The cuts in the train connections strike the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the economic life and competitiveness of the region.
And that depends on whether or not you can live and work here at all, the mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also highlights air transport, which has also been followed several times in the report.
It is important for the whole of the region that we do not have the means to reduce our chances of doing this through state measures, as is now the case.
We should look at the impact of the abolition of these transport connections on, for example, employment," Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of traffic connections is a further challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, Principal of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot for research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Director of Recruitment, says that it is already difficult to market the university towards Western Finland because the connections are weak in a transverse direction.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside of Eastern Finland.
About 10-20 per cent of them are from New Zealand, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of the sound of gravel for the battle of Siu
The City Government of Joensuu's vision of the regional Siu Sote project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel sounds is amongst the number.
Pentti Keskalo (in the picture), a member of the City Government, presented the government's rejection of the entire project at a Monday's meeting, but his presentation was unprofitable.
The Government approved the draft decision of the mayor, Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the meeting of the City Council, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from the Eagle to Kouvola will end next year
Rail transport from the Eagle to Kouvola will continue, although one train is less than one train.
There will be changes to passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train shift is missed, but five times a day is still available from the Eagle to Kouvola and vice versa.
The reductions are due to state-owned savings measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’s purchase fees for the next four years will fall by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely completed.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys were snooping around.
The rescue facility let a 12 - year - old climbed from the climbing roof, who couldn't get off the roof on his own.
The situation took place on Ketotie at 6 p.m. Tuesday night in Tornionmäe.
There is an old two - storyed wooden house with no ladders on the roof.
It did not stop the boy group who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of the radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, the rest of the people swung from the scene and the passers alarmed the rescue facility to help the last person on the roof safely returned to the surface.
FedEx's turnover varies, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx announced its weak performance in the last quarter, leaving the transport sector weakened its forecast of performance throughout the year due to a decrease in demand for freight services and increased costs for land transport.
The company plans to hire 55 000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
This time last year, FedEx announced that he would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
The company's share decreased by about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the opening of the actual trade on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is between 10.40 and 10.90 dollars for the financial year ending in May. The forecast is a drop of 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to factset's research, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has deteriorated despite an average price increase of 4.9%. The increases will enter into force on 4 January. Additional charges for land transport of heavy or large consignments will enter into force in November.
The company still expects profit growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher net sales and increased e-commerce.
The President and CEO, Fred Smith, stated that the company had done well in a weaker economic situation than expected, particularly in terms of production and global trade.
The plans for the recruitment of seasonal workers were announced the day after the competitor’s plans were announced to employ approximately the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. between 90 000 and 95 000 persons.
In the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx’s operating profit was $692 million, which means an increase of 6%.
The return per share was $2.42, and the forecast of the 12 analysts of Zacks Investment Research was left behind.
Turnover rose by five per cent to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been experiencing a reduction in international first-class transmissions, which is why the company's Express unit has been failing.
The strong growth in e-commerce has confirmed the result of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the net sales of land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the operating profit showed an increase in the costs of large-scale shipments and insurance.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic charges, while the return on freight business decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the opening of the real trade, FedEx’s share price had fallen to $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the share ended with a decrease of 11 per cent from the annual average and 17 per cent below the highest listing recorded on 11 June.
This week, the decisionmakers of the U.S. Central Bank Fed will meet for the most anticipated meeting for years, sitting at a eight - foot [8 m] - foot [8 m] - long - diameter] CNC tree table to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
On the wall of the decorated two - story meeting room of the central bank, there is a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues, must put the state's financial interests ahead of all other interests.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: to maximise employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, since the major recession, the central bank's management has taken note of the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
On Thursday, the central bank is due to announce whether the US economy is ready to start depreciating the unforeseeable stimulus offered by short interest rates close to zero to the end of 2008.
Although most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, the recent shock in the financial markets can already cause cautious central bank officials to startle the increase in volatility by increasing the federal tax reference rate – even by one percentage point.
"The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important in their practical follow-up", says Lindsey M. Piegza, the main economic operator of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty of the global market will give sufficient reason to wait again", Piegza continues.
Those who are thinking about this do not agree with what the central bank is planning, which in itself causes nervousness.
Approximately half of the economicians in Bloomberg’s study were exhausted this week.
However, in the financial markets it is expected that the central bank will be waiting, and the key indicator is that only 30% of the potential for a raise is available.
If the central bank raises its interest rate, the exchange rates may be reduced unless the decision-makers soften the impact by promising a second draw.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average increased by 228.89 points or by 1.4 percentage points to 16 599.85.
"The expectations of the central bank to maintain the interest rate this week were behind the flashback," said John Lonski, chief economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest rates at this stage," he said.
"If this were to happen, the central bank would have to give careful consideration to how to keep the hands of those operating on the financial markets unscrupulously."
In turn, the second experts noted that raising interest rates would help to calm the financial markets and remove uncertainty about when the central bank would operate.
Only a month ago, the central bank seemed to be tilting to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step towards tightening the financial conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Mr Yellen has said that he was looking forward to raising interest rates throughout the spring and early spring this year, despite the fact that according to the Liberals, economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month and is now at its lowest level for seven years and close to the level that the central bank is going to count as full employment.
Earnings seem to be getting better.
Although inflation continued to fall below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, the central bank’s decision-makers stated that the main reason for this was the temporary impact of oil prices.
"The economy can and does need higher interest rates, as long as they take into account the strict situation of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the main economic economist of the Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However , the global financial markets did not startle last month , when China was dwindling its currency .
Dow Jones industrial average fell up to 16 percentage points from the record height in May and investors feared that the economic downturn in China would also affect global growth.
The market has accelerated this month, and Dow Jones has now fallen by almost 10% from the top readings in May.
The shock of the market means that the central bank’s decision-makers are even more complicated to reflect on the increase in the interest rate.
"The work of the central bank is complicated despite what happened on the financial markets and what news has been coming out of the decline in the Chinese economy in recent weeks", said Stephen D. Oliner, the senior researcher of the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Central Bank official.
He now believes that the central bank will wait at least a month to deal with the effects.
"There is great uncertainty as to the impact on the United States economy; there is little reliable information on the situation since the recent developments in the Chinese economy", Oliner said.
The restoration of the world economy is not the central bank's main concern, so it should in principle not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most powerful player in the world's monetary economy.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, only a hint from then President Ben S. Bernanken that the central bank could narrow down the scope of its operations caused upheavals around the world.
In the world today, markets and economies are closely intertwined. In addition to monitoring world developments, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the world economy.
"The decision-making process of the central bank is more art than science," said Zachary Karebell, director of the global strategy of the financial management company Envesnet Inc.
The President of the Regional Central Bank of Jeffrey Lawer Richmond stated this month that the central bank has previously overreacted on financial market movements that do not seem to have a link to the basic pillars of the economy.
The Federal Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee) has been asked by Mr Lacker to raise the interest rate, as an example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The economic crisis in Asia resulted in the central bank's decision to reduce the steering rate by 0.75 percentage points at three meetings, although only limited identifiable penalties were available for economic growth in the United States", Mr Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank reversed the decision.
"The central bank should give priority to monetary stability only in a major crisis, as in the economic collapse of 2008," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England Committee on Interest Rates.
The latest shock doesn't even approach the situation at the time," he said.
"There is absolutely no need to be afraid of raising the heels because of market shock," added the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Posen.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention monetary stability, until this changes, I do not think we should take the lead."

Brazil’s Rio Grande Paediatric Association promotes a healthy diet for breast-feeding
Brazil’s Rio Grande Children’s Association SPRS has developed a blinding way of teaching breast-feeding women the meaning of a proper diet. They are presented with pictures of babies breast-fed with images of unhealthful food.
Human breast milk is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which gives the baby all the food he needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Because of the extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 kilocalords.
According to the new study, in addition to increasing calorie intake, other dietary changes should be made.
A recent study by Professor Robert Waterland of Texas Baylor College of Medicine revealed that a pregnant woman’s healthy diet can affect the baby’s genes and protect the baby from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthful diet was found to have a negative effect on the infant’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrissa's biggest viewers, even though Nine's trying to get a lead in today's show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson would like to thank Canberra for the morning program on the post-elections of the Liberal Party leaders, which, however, did not improve today's audiences.
The Nine Channel's morning program was sent from the capital, Malcolm Turnbull, after Tony Abbott was deported.
David Kochi and Samantha Armytage’s competing channel’s morning programme was sent from London. Special weekly broadcasts are also sent from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance apparently did not matter to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise’s average of 397,000 viewers in five state capitals, and today’s programme of 339 000 viewers.
Today's audience rose slightly compared to last Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000) but remained to read last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reached the distance to Sunris in the last few months.
In August, today had an average of 318 000 viewers, Sunrinen 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has reached an average of 349 000 viewers and today’s 314 000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event in the morning.
The changes will have a greater impact on Parliament this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The Seven had 800 Words novelty series with the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with two of his children. The new series reached the highest number of 1,219,000 viewers.
Critics have suspected that the Thomson hit series would be enough to be a star alone, without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to last night's audiences, the answer is clearly positive.
Seven's The X Factor maintained its strong position with 1,136,000 viewers. The series clearly defeated The Block (838 000) and TBL's Families series (726 000).
Sevenin The Chase Australia has captured the viewers in a variety of ways.
From the first half-hour of the new sketch series, launched by Andrew O'Keefe (17.00-17.30), the average number of viewers was 446 000.
In the second half-hour (17.30–18:00), the number of viewers rose to 623 000, which was more than Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 viewers, and the second half gathered a huge 720 000 viewers.
Hot Seat's audience was 620,000.
The second night audience in The Chase Australia showed the Nine Channel that Hot Seat will pass by another 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, who was unable to challenge the McGuire series.
The case was originally published under the title "Sunrise One, Today focuses on local news".
The final trio really thinks Sam Wood is the bachelor of the Dreams – but who is the man to choose?
Did the secret come out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly exposed the choice of a bachelor of dreams.
The final selection of the dream bachelor Sam Wood has been a well-preserved secret.
The three remaining women do not whisper a word about who has received the last rose from the bachelor.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows about the moods before one of the three was dropped, and the women could be unwittingly hinting who was going to be the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's finals.
All three women were thrilled that Wood was a perfect man. Women praised the sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness of a man and considered him to be a suitable partner for themselves.
When women were asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood if the last rose did not hit its own place, their answers could give an indication of who would take the bachelor’s heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay the most suitable partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been easy since the beginning.
"As soon as I came to the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam were well suited. This feeling has been preserved throughout the program," said Jeavons-Ballows.
"Sarah has legs on the ground, and he's a really fun company," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a couple of people.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay told me that he realized last week on a hometown date that Wood might be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is not just a race. I'm now putting my attention fully on our relationship," said Mackay.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if a man did not choose him, she answered mysteriously:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like other girls just as much, Snezana and Lana are equal."
Dream bachelor on the Ten-channel Wednesday at 7.30 p.m.
The case was originally published under the title "Sarah Sam Wood's Selection"?
Jarryd Hayne has several options for starting the NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayene after this changed to the United States. Several other clubs also took an interest in the man after last year’s impressive open day of training.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the selection seems to have hit the button.
Some of the coachs would have kept Hayne on the bench, as he was in the ranks of the Australian rugby country team. Hayne would have played the rebound after the victory was taken from Minnesota on Tuesdays 20–3.
However, Tomsula showed confidence in Hayne and gave the man another chance to return the flight. The coach kept Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued her line in the locker after the game.
He didn't rush newcomers in front of the rest of the team. He encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a post-game press conference.
Special Editor Cam Inman of 49ers reported that Hayne also received encouragement from Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne plays the catch, the first quarter of the game against the Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and her Australian fans had been expecting another man from the NFL debyyt.
After failure, Hayne left the field hundreds of times and later told Hamish and Andy the 2DayFM 104.1 channel that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"These things happen, and we have to move on," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error with his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007, when his input in his own area opened a place for Queensland.
The whole experience was still incredible for a 27-year-old young person.
Hayne published a picture in Instagram where she poses with fans and the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia was arrested with a gun at the airport in Siberia.
Hodorkovski, who was openly challenged by President Vladimir Putin, was convicted, Jukos, a man-owned oil company, was expelled and his work in favour of democracy was restricted.
Four dead policemen shot rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal
Four people died in South Nepal, and the source of authority told us on Wednesday, and the police fired rubber bullets at a crowd in the protest against the alleged new constitution of the country, including a four-year-old boy.
Violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh area, less than three hundred kilometers from the capital Katmandus.
According to District Chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 protestors had gathered outside the police station, some of which were throwing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used tear gas and fired it in the air before they shot rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which can kill but are generally considered to be a less damaging alternative, suddenly were so lethal.
This was the most recent clashes in weeks of protests in the southern plains of Nepal, where, according to the Madhesi tribe, the new provinces based on the new constitution would undermine their political influence.
The protests have also been seen in Western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe demands its own state.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have died in violent cribs since 10 August,
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, it is an important step towards a new constitution, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where administration has been concentrated for centuries.
The new constitution has been under way since 2008, but the legislators speeded up the process since thousands of people died in the shocking earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted on the constitutional clauses in Kathmandu this week, and the authorities believe that the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
Hurricane centre NHC: 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours is likely to develop at 60 percent of the southernmost parts of Cape Verde, reports the National Hurricane Center of the United States on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Aeronautics Department, there is also a clear centre of low pressure in the middle of Cape Verde and the Little Antiques. It can also develop into a tropical cyclone with a 60% probability in the next two days.
Google plans to raise 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) announced that it would launch a campaign to raise 11 million dollars for humanitarian aid organisations to help thousands of people who have fled war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced the donation campaign in its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of being in charge, Google’s employee Rita Masoud started the campaign by sharing his own experiences and was only seven years old when he fled Kabul with his family.
"We traveled by train and bus in the dark, and we were starving, thirsty, cold and afraid," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
After the European crisis on refugees and migrants, many families in a similar situation are badly in need of help.
Donations are addressed to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children's Association and UN refugee organisation.
After donations have been collected at google.com/refugeelief through $5 million, Google promises to donate an equivalent amount, thus reaching a total of 11 million.
The European refugee crisis is then at its worst in World War II, and the situation is exacerbated, in particular by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has resulted in more than four million people being forced to flee their homes this year.
War also has to be fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to the new study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics live longer after obesity surgery than those receiving unsurgery treatment.
"It takes time to get the mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who discussed new research in JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, i.e. bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach bag by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective in type 2 diabetes. However, the majority of the studies have been conducted in overweight patients with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 35.
The weight index shall indicate the weight/length ratio with a normal value of 18,5 to 24,9.
When the body mass index is over 25, the person is overweight and the body weight index of more than 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, researchers at the Taiwani Min-Sheng Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, stomach bypass surgery and sleeve surgery, type 2 diabetes medications in mildly obese individuals.
After obesity surgery, the mean body weight index decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The body weight index of patients treated without surgery was maintained at 29 hours.
Patients undergoing surgery had a total improvement of 36% and a partial improvement of 28%.
In the treatment group, only 1% and only about 2% of patients had a complete improvement in their diabetes.
The study also showed that blood pressure, triglycerides, and bad LDL cholesterol were superior in the surgical treatment group.
In addition, patients were monitored for haemoglobin levels of A1c, which reflect the development of blood sugar.
According to researchers, the recommended haemoglobin level is less than 7%.
After surgery, haemoglobin A1c decreased from 9% on average to 6%.
In the treatment group, the value remained unchanged at approximately 8%.
However, a study group led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu found that this did not reduce mortality over a period of five years.
The study group also compared the results of two different surgical methods.
In the fifth year, in the gastric bypass surgery group, weight loss was higher than in the sleeve surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the weight index drop was higher (7.4 and 5.1), and the haemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%) were also increased in the secondary surgery group.
However, according to the Swedish study at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, surgery treatment will bring life years to fat people.
In the Swedish study, the risk of death was reduced by 29 per cent compared to the traditional treatment group.
Although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, according to Blackstone, it was confirmed that persons with a body mass index of less than 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important finding in the study, as it says that surgery is safe in the lower body mass index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," wrote Blackstone.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the weight index is between 27 and 30.
"We wait too long for people to take the situation seriously," the researcher said.
"When there are genetic changes in the human body that expose obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation."
"Not everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is not capable of receiving all the refugees, and the Dalai Lama has said that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leading character of Tibetan Buddhism has called for the end of violence in the refugees' countries.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the refugee crisis in his visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama spoke at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the present situation humanity must be put ahead of individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is to be admired, it is not enough in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," said the Dalai Lama in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their action in a crisis situation, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"The care of thousands of refugees is a wonderful thing to do, but at the same time long-term solutions must be considered and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education", the Dalai Lama stressed.
"In the end, we must consider how we can reduce killing in these countries.
The use of force must be reduced.
Powers have never solved problems," he added.
Furthermore, when talking about violence, the Dalai Lama commented on George Bush's actions in the context of the 11 September terrorist attacks and claimed that, in response to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the attacks of 11 September, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution was created through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he resorted to forces with unpredictable consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Ingestion cases in children quadrupled in four years
According to Georgia’s Poison Center, poisoning centres across the United States report an almost 4-fold increase in alcohol-intolerant cases in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the head of the Georgia Poison Centre, cases of ingestion of handicrafts reported to poisoning centres in children under 12 years of age increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly accessible to children, and unfortunately some children are in emergency care," Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink handicrafts on purpose, some to impress their friends and some to impress social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers who drink disinfectants because of cheap hops.
It is reported that teenagers mix alcoholic mouthwash with disinfectant to get stronger from drinking.
Smaller children can be attracted to the smell of handmades.
"The child doesn't think the substance is bad," Lopez said.
"A large part of the attractive handmade products have just been perfumed.
There are handmade products of strawberries, grapes and orange flavours, which appeal to children."
The alcoholic strength by volume of disinfectants shall be between 45 % and 95 %.
For infants, a small amount can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcohol content of the hands is very high", Stephen Thornton, medical director of Kansas University Hospital Poison Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave a whiskey hot in children's reach, but if hand disinfectants are often left in children's reach, they will quickly receive a large amount of alcohol."
Six - year - old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four pieces of strawberries at school, and the girl was delivered for first - aid treatment.
"The alcohol content of the girl’s blood was 179, which is twice the adult’s limit of drunkenness," says the doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Chris Ritchey Atlanta.
And he couldn't walk when they brought him to first aid.
The doctors followed the girl’s condition overnight in a separate children’s hospital for brain damage, for she had fallen and hit her head after she had had had been drinking,” Ritchey said.
"Your account was really scary," Nhajah's mother said Ortoria Scott to CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and towels in addition to being moved beyond the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some of the disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontarioan women died after swallowing a handheld containing a toxic substance which had not been reported.
The health authorities considered that the product contained lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter was indicated in the product information leaflet as an active substance.
According to the police report, three fourth - class students in the north of the state of New York planned to kill a "bad" teacher by placing antibacterial products all over the classroom in January.
The teacher is very allergic to the handles and told him not to bring it into the classroom.
The police considered that the plan that had gone down was meaningless and called on the school to take disciplinary action.
A rumor mill: no dissenting in the lines of Celtic
Griffith's diminishing the Celtic team's unconvincing, while Deila admits that the team is not well, but believes that it will make things right.
Hearts buttons opposite the SFA for Neilson's punishment, and Warburton will watch out for the January player transfers so that the team's unity will not suffer
Aberdeen's neck to Celtic five points
The first half of Adam Rooney's punishment brought Aberdeen a limited victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium. The victory raised Aberdeen's five-point escape from Celtic.
Griffiths is a little bit of a talk-out of a misappropriation.
According to his own words, the Griffiths and his teams are not subject to observation as they prepare to meet the Dutch serial leader.
"I don't think we're under any pressure, and I think the players are waiting to meet.
The Dutch miss the old Scottish pair – de Boer
The former Rangers middle-field player and the Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have stated that the interest of Dutch football fans in Celtic has been lost because they are no longer allowed to follow the battles between Celtic and Rangers.
De Boer, a team leader in Ajax, said: "The management no longer presents the highlights of the Celtic games. Why?
Because Rangers are no longer involved."
"We're not just talking about Rangers' return here.
They're talking about Old Firm.
The Dutch are in need of double combat between the teams.
Old Firm games have enormous tensions and are also interested in them beyond the borders of Scotland."
I'm going to turn it around, Deila's going to convince me.
Mr Deila admits that it is difficult for Celtic, but the Norwegian loan assures us that the situation will change.
Malmö’s lost club fell from the Masters’ League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, which now has a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic's been having a rough time before, and we're getting up again," Deila said.
"We want to improve our situation as soon as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and in many it causes anger or sorrow.
So do we, but we need to move on.
We desperately need the support of the Celtic supporters, as it will significantly strengthen players.
It's a very important moment for us to be together."
Warburton with caution in January player transfers
Although it was only a few weeks ago that Rangers' boss Mark Warburton tipped out about the players' transfer targets in January, he was cautious about the transfer role and said that he wanted to jeopardise the unity of the team.
"January player transfers differ significantly from summer transfers," Brentford's ex-trainer said.
"The players involved in the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the beginning of the season, which has been successful in this season in our composition.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary purchases of players can cause more harm to the team than benefits."
Michu, the target of Celtic’s recovery
Swansea's assailant Michu has been associated with Celtic in the player transfer speeches, while Michu has been referring to retirement since the end of the Swans agreement.
A 29-year-old Michu has been a pain in the ass for years, and he failed to get a move from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for the SFA fight with Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team finally lost 3-2. The defenseman's red card was later cancelled. It's already the third Collum red card in eight months, which will be cancelled.
But Neilson stays behind what he said, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on the performance.
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastlea
The Griffiths were reviled when he admitted he had been making abusive songs about a former Hearts player named Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in the pub in the Edinburgh Roseburn area before the Edinburgh local fight in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local fight, and the mood was intense," said the attacker. "I can assure you that I'm not going back to Tynecastle except in the ranks of Celtic."
Tannadice’s management team believes Dundee United’s coaching team – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures me that Dundee United's management team can turn this into a better one.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready to fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy with Hamilton's victory with a dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen was desperate to stand up to Hamilton's seventh consecutive league victory. With the victory, Aberdeen took a five-point neck to Celtic at the top of the serial table, which is to thank for Adam Rooney's punishment in the first half.
"There is no Cup or League winning team that would not have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment as usual in Scotland, growing in the British Islands
The number of unemployed persons remained unchanged in Scotland in May-July. There are 164 000 unemployed. In the United Kingdom, the number of unemployed persons grew by 10 000 at the same time.
According to the Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent, compared to 5.5 per cent in the United Kingdom as a whole.
The number of employed persons in Scotland is 12,000 less than three months earlier. The number of employed persons is now 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent in the quarter, with the United Kingdom as a whole having an average employment rate of 73.5 per cent.
The Scottish Minister for Affairs David Mundell commented on recent figures: "The long-term management plan has laid the foundations for a strong economy."
Almost exactly a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to survive as part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: unemployment has decreased.
Why am I following the execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for cancellation, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not hope, I will sit in the execution room of the State Penitentiary of Oklahoma when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
I received an invitation in January through a man’s best friend, and despite my shock, I responded positively.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought I could tell you a true story about the death penalty.
The perspective would be unique.
Suppliers will be able to follow executions in the United States, and since there are more applications than places, participants will be selected with a macabre value.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of reporters from 12 to 5.
The chosen will follow the execution with moderation.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've created a personal relationship with him, because we've been on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits took me two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I cannot be present as both a witness and a journalist, so I must not include a notebook and a pen to make notes.
All I have to do is try to put the details in my head.
A reporter in Oklahoma accused me of jeopardising neutrality on Twitter.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell the condemned story in a way that pleases him, you'll get close to him."
I gave the reporter a different opinion.
The journalist admitted that he could have formulated his words more carefully, but he still found my actions wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed on some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what I'm writing, and even if he tried to tell me what I'm writing, I wouldn't do it.
I've told him he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants to see an international journalist who can write about what happened.
If Glosi dies, he believes that publicity will promote a movement against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast broadcast.
I will not repeat the details in this connection.
I can't tell you Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of helping after the crime.
However, I believe that it is very likely that Mr Glossip did not commit murder.
I firmly believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I will follow his execution.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
You can read an unbiased description of other journalists' stories.
I'll tell you what it's like to watch a man die in vain.
The man was lured from the Canning River after a watery police hunt.
The officer in the Canning Vale area remained dry when he lured a man up from the Canning River.
The Perthian man's escape attempt hit a shallow, muddy water, and a few metres away, the police got the man grounded back to dry land.
Canning Vale Police got a call on Tuesday about an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, they discovered a suspect who was trying to escape the police by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"The man standing in the water said he wouldn't come out of the water and told the police to pick him up," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
The watering of Officer Lachlan Perhavec's uniform was not attractive, so he chose safer tactics – negotiation.
"Sometimes, an escape attempt makes a person resort to amusing means," said Sergeant Castledine.
The case of football master Ben Cousins is a remarkable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid the police blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man’s attempt was doomed, but the tempatus inspired the locals to plan the Ben Cousins biathlon.
According to Peter Moody, the officials tried to spy on him, and he's threatening to stop competing.
Peter Moody blames the competitions of Racing Victoria on the spy company last year, and he threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that the officials and racing Victoria's integrity department have attacked him personally, and the rejection of Lady Tatai because of the treatment recently given on the day of the race was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to work for competitive sports. Moody was in a difficult situation when a cobalt was found in the Lidar sample and the man was unable to explain the discovery.
Moody has kept his tongue under control for a year and a half, and he did not want the accusations to appear to be a bitter man.
"I wasn't going to bring it up, and I've been thinking about this for a long time, but sometimes frustration breaks out with a single throw," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes we have to react and accept the consequences, and now I have to accept the space after I open my mouth.
I'm gonna go home and sleep well at night.
I want the horse owners to think I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't want to go on as a horse coach anymore.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier at an interview at Racing.com, where he told me about the intelligence efforts in the integrity department at his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Daily Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job at my stable to spy on my actions. I'll tell him when I asked for his name," Moody told Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If so, they should present the evidence, for I have not been caught in any unauthorized way.
The former Chairman of the RVL, Robert Roulston, the current Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of the RVL, were aware of the action at the time and now.
Should I consider the situation a personal chaser?
Should the RVL take real action and take responsibility for the situation in this sector for non-trainers?
Am I a threat to the industry?
Am I really a threat to the industry?
Maybe that's what a lot of people think.
Perhaps I would still have a training license and be pushed away from my duties, and there is no doubt that with my speeches I will make many think so.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'm pressuring them to make their decision.
My family supports me, and I can back off."
The long - lasting study of Lider’s cobalt values and the recent rejection situation made the coach finally frustrated so that he threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the unbeatable master Black Caviar. The man described the rule of racing day as ridiculous after the horse had an irregular clay roll on his feet.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for that," Moody said.
"The person in my staff was wrongly putting clay on the horse's foot.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done last day, and that's what happened.
But it happened on the day of the race."
Moody can expect a three-month ban on illegal clay treatment, which the organisers have begun to investigate.
"This is a joke.
The rules are made by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Arrested from Cobram's crash site
The police have arrested a cyclist this weekend who escaped from the crash site.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and he was seriously injured by a car crash on a Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, a man driving a car fled the scene and did not stay to help an injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia reported to the Shepparton Police.
A man is likely to face charges of non-compliance with suspension and assistance obligations in the event of a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
A 40 - year - old biker from Cobram is still in hospital, and his condition is stable.
The Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy refers to the wrestling speeches of the opponents.
Coach Craig Bellamy, Melbourne Storm, considers the criticism of his team's anti-tank game to be a purposeful action by the NRL's two leagues.
According to Sydney Rooster's coach Trent Robinson, the judges gave Storm the wrestling to the trouble of the Melbourne hosts in a game of qualifiers in Sydney on Friday night.
The Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely covered the reference to Storm Broncos in the finals on Saturday night of the Queensland Cowboys. He called the game a model match and said that there is no more focus on wrestling in Queensland.
Bellamy defended her own team's fighting game and said they were just focused on contact in the fight.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was increased by the fact that the two top team coachs criticised his team. Bellamy considered this to be proof that the coachs were concerned about the loss of Storm.
"This thing always comes up. I think Trent Robinson didn't say anything about wrestling when his team won us 24-2", Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee you that we have not changed anything in our defence system or in our techniques all year long. For the last six weeks, we have only invested in the contact game and fighting, which has turned us up.
Trent's been on this mission for three years, and the loss could have been a shock to him, because he's got a great team that's not used to losing.
It's funny that the same thing always comes out at the same time of year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett on what is interesting football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne's talking about interesting football.
He compared his own team's Saturday game to our Friday game and thought their game was interesting," Bellamy said.
"In 2010, St. Georgea received a lot of criticism for his boring game. Wayne said that the criticism did not stop him.
Now he has a team that is able to play so-called football, especially his young, fast-paced midgets.
That's the kind of football you want to play when a player's arsenal is like this.
He stressed this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play with his style. Not all teams have central players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
This gives me more confidence when other coachs are so worried about meeting my team that they're relying on something like this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that there were more goals in Storm and Roosters than in Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven’t seen it, but what was the result? 16-12?
The final result of our game was 20-18. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are game breaks and lowliness interesting football?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them."
The Storm has a free weekend, as the team will be visiting either North Queensland Cowboys on Cronull Sharks next Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
A Serbian man released for $200,000 bail in a drug case
A 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released from a possible life sentence attempt against a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month on a 100-pound cocaine shipment from Solay, which had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at the port of Comera in August.
The police observed the meeting between Maksimovic and his accomplice at the boatport for the morning, and then caught two surprises at the Comera Roadhouse coffee shop.
Even though Maximovic is looking forward to a possible life sentence for possession of drugs for commercial purposes, according to a man’s lawyer, there is no evidence that his client has tried to take over the entire batch, but he may have been in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
According to Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maximovic will try to escape the country.
"Maksimovic clearly has links to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," the judge stated in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about his place of residence."
Maximovic’s mother and stepfather jointly paid 200,000 guarantees against which the man was released.
"After reading the sworn testimony of both persons, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
"But that alone is not enough to prevent a man from running," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he surrenders his passports to both Australia and Serbia, reports daily to the police and stays at home from 6am to 6am.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to get the pedophiles to send pictures.
The pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to get access to pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while she was sleeping and logged in to an online communications service, where she made another user send her inappropriate photos of children.
Later, when she woke up, she noticed that the phone was missing and found that she was sleeping in Hogg’s hand.
When she checked the contents of her phone, she found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
These five photos were reported to the police. After searching the computers found at the address, the police found disturbing Internet searches using search words to search for inappropriate child photos.
Hogg claimed to have tried to mislead the pedophiles on the Internet and to present the police in order to scare the pedophiles.
The prosecutor, Eilith Robertson, said at the local judiciary in Dundee Sheriff Court: "He claimed to be dependent on the intimidation of people.
He admitted that he had made searches on a computer, but claimed that he had done so in order to present the police and thus be able to intimidate the pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about discussions with an unknown person who had sent the pictures to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead the pedophiles.
He told me that he had received disturbing thoughts while drinking and that he wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "When she found the messages on the phone, she screamed at her mother, shaking and crying."
The girl saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
She told me that the defendant used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
23-year-old Hogg Dunden from Ward Road confessed to the charges of possession of inappropriate child pictures last June 14th. Hogg violated his immunity from bail on 25 January this year and failed to come to court for consultation on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim requested that Hoggia not be entered in the register of sex offenders, as it could be considered that the offence did not contain any significant sexual characteristics.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the execution of the judgment to October due to background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted immunity from bail in this case, but he was held in detention on other grounds.
Hogg was already entered in the sex offender's register before the date of the conviction.
Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe, is giving the wrong speech in Parliament
The oldest head of state in Africa, Mugabe, fell in the stairs leading to the speaker’s upheaval earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of what happened quickly spread in social media.
Parliament's opening party was also followed by claims by opposition legislaters that they have received an anonymous death threat, which warns them not to budge to Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, the Members of the House were bouncing and interrupting the President's speech on the state of the state in Parliament, and the President gave the same speech on Tuesday.
Mr Innocent Gonese, the bishop of the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), said that seven opposition politicians received text messages calling on them not to interfere with Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the title of the message is "death", Gonese told journalists after Mugabe spoke.
The message warns the recipients that outside Parliament representatives are no longer immune.
The party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings operations in business services.
HP is divided into two listed companies later this year and separates computer and printer business from faster growing business hardware and service activities.
According to the HP press release, the company will record one-off costs of $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter onwards.
"Restructuring will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, CEO of HP, who will manage the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more concentrated company than the present HP, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of business activities that will help companies move into a new business style" Whitman said.
"Our position as our own company is better than ever, and we are better able to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual turnover is over $50 billion and the company focuses on its mission to deliver unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
In the 1930s, a company founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, a professor of Stanford University, is now divided into two groups.
The HP has implemented massive reorganisations while switching from traditional desktop computers to mobile devices.
The second largest computer manufacturer in the world and HP, one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the latest transfers in a sector that is believed to be successful.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arte: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes well with the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he cannot return to the airport already in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to miss at least the next four English national teams, knowing the history of the man, his participation in the European Championships is clearly unclear.
The biggest problem with the latest problem is that Wilshere decided after the last season more harshly and seemed to have returned to his former edge during the new season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten your career," Wenger said.
"The bone didn't heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically, this may be the case, but as Wenger said, additional injuries can come when the player tries to return to the field during the season.
There is also an unpleasant conformity here.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different kinds of trouble since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played in Arsenal’s ranks in just 65 out of 157 league matches in the last five seasons.
The broader picture of Arsenal is that since the period 2007-2008, six out of eight teams have been the second of the most money-lost teams since the injuries.
Wenger accepts a possible vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the injury statistics improved in the last season will continue to develop in a better direction.
"Sometimes after the injury, there may be a vulnerable period in which to strengthen the body and apply for competitive powers," said Wenger.
"Jack's young, so he'll be fine.
I hope he balances his body, and I believe in it, and that will continue his career as he deserves."
Arsenal will start his work on Wednesday night of the Masters League against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will meet Chelsea on Saturday and the following Wednesday of Tottenham Hotspur. Wenger will prepare for small changes in the composition.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arte are likely to be the starting point.
Wenger can also be replaced by Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give rest to those who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for the continuation of Group F, Maximir Zagreb has the most frightening stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been unbeatable for 41 game time team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night when the country was shaking at 3.2 on Richter's scale.
The shock was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his lesson of the past season since he had to bend to Monaco. He is also still motivated by the far-reaching hope of shooting the team towards the European championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"We haven't hit this title yet.
On the other hand, we were very close in 2006. I am also realistic with experience.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truth about male friendship
A similar description shines with its absence in other series, especially when it comes to the fact that the need for men to open up is greater than ever and the statistics on suicide among young men are up to 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the most significant cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Britain. Suicide is three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) tackles the problem by declaring 2015 as a year for men. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendliness is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In a recent study, 2,000 high school students were interviewed. According to the study, the chances of improvement for those suffering from depression symptoms are better if there are enough healthy people around them.
The likelihood of disease among asymptomatic people was also halved if there were people nearby who had no mental health problems.
But all of this is based on friendship.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content.
With the digitalization of life, the need seems strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
The values, money, image and social status associated with superficial success all draw attention from our inner values and our natural desire for personal growth and friendship. Internal values are more deeply influenced by our mental health.
A millionaire in the video game recently noted that money cannot actually buy happiness.
So the French's fineness was that the series turned the focus upside down.
None of the characters in the series were defined by profession but by personality.
It was a humorous act of Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football on their TV chairs. We also often saw Ross miss Rachel. It was obvious that men could identify with this, even though they did not refrain from knowing him fully.
A volunteer explained this to me: "When I heard people who are depressed and thinking about suicide, it has become clear to me how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us often cannot speak to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should cope is strong. A man is easily considered weak if he talks about his problems."
"Frends is one of the series that presents long-term survival mechanisms.
A series of moments of male friendship were highlighted.
I can offer help from outside as a moment of despair, but long-term support is provided from a close-up of friends and family."
In honor of Comedy Central's FriendsFest, the set of sets has been brought to life, so if you're going to attend the event this weekend, you'd better take your friends for coffee at Central Perk.
Or do something even better. Smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can be.
Comedy Central sends the whole Frendit series – all 236 episodes – #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after she scored against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria managed to score in her Masters League debut and helped PSG to hit the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and rating.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were struck when Paris Saint-Germain began his work in the Masters League by hitting Malmön Parc des Princes Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored after the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. She confirmed the position of the French masters immediately in the handshake. PSG, however, pushed several goals before they could finally add to their lead: Cavani painted after the game had been played for 60 minutes.
In Section A there are also Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG not only aims for a follow-up in the playoffs, but also wants to improve its position for the quarter-terms in the remaining three matches.
Even though SPG caught the score, the match was not the perfect performance of a team shot by Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost his goal and the man was switched when he was faced with his former home club, where he began his great career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or in guests in the Masters' League, so the 2-0 win and good grips will give us a good basis, even though we still have a disappointing season", Blanc said.
"This one knows good.
We were thirsty for victory and we were able to do it, but it's a shame we couldn't do one or two extra goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team's ranks after the injury. During the weekend, the team had to be satisfied with 2-2 in the Ligue 1 series against Bordeaux. However, Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in her shadow at four minutes.
Last month, the Argentinan pier that moved from Manchester United to PSG lines was named the PSG solver, which will raise the team to a new level in Europe. He proved himself worthy of the appointment when he gave way to Marco Verratt's defense and then fired a precise hit at the rear corner of Johan Wiland.
However, those awaiting PSG’s crushing victory were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched to the field with nine international players from the start. The team playing with the defense of five men and the tactics of two attackers was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot was barely missed Kevin Trapp's goal in the back of the game in 34 minutes. The team did not attack very actively.
Instead, PSG fell into futile feeding and poor finishing, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals only in the first half. At the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick put the paint on the wigs of Cavani.
But Ibrahimovic showed his nails in the pitch game. Di Maria shot a twist past Wiland at 52 minutes from Ibrahimovic's feed.
The second goal was created during the Count's time thanks to Cavan. The six-played Uruguayan shot the full shot when Ibrahimovic fed him a left winger for Maxwell's kick.
Malmö’s letter ended with another goal, and only David Luiz, the top combatant of Wiland’s close range, kept his readings in check for the shot, and Ezequiel Lavez’s goal from the bench was abandoned at the very end of the meter.
Malmön's pilot Åge Hareide later admitted that PSG was his own class. "We played the previous Masters League game last December.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, where the level is not the same.
It's not enough to cut it.
A hat pickup for the Parisians.
This was a great fight for them."
Glencore collects $2.5 billion with a share issue.
The Swiss mining waste Glencore, which was tested by lower raw materials prices, collected USD 2.5 billion in Wednesday’s share capital as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, stated in its opinion that he had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion in order to reduce debts.

The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington.
The White House's communication on Tuesday confirms that the Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping will arrive at his first official visit to Washington on 25 September, after a visit by President Barack Obama to Beijing last November.
Following bilateral discussions between the Heads of State or Government, the President of the United States and his wife, Michelle Obama, are hosting dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, in honour of the state visit.
"The visit by President Xi Jinping gives us the opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have the opportunity to engage in constructive discussions on topics that are controversial", the White House Communication states.
Xi Jinping was first announced in February and is expected to visit Seattle to meet several U.S. technological leaders. From Seattle, the President's journey would first continue to Washington and then to New York, to the UN General Assembly on 28 September.
Obama and Xin are expected to raise a number of controversial issues, such as Washington's concern about China's alleged cyber spying and increased country action in controversial waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon reduces diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon had an intense conversation with the African American Effie Brown and said that diversity was not needed behind the camera.
In the HBO Project Greenlight series presented on Sunday night, Brown was interrupted by an actor who explained how important it was to take into account the different views of the dark person in the selected script.
"The diversity is taken into account in the role of the film, not in the role of the program," Damon claimed.
Brown was stunned and hurt by his claim. "Wow, that's all," she said, after Damon's comment on the solo film "Mars".
Damon and Brown had met with the other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
"Whoever the director is, I'd like to encourage you to think about how the Harmony character is being presented," Brown said at the outset.
"The only dark-skinned character is a prostitute who's having sex with her white pimp."
The producer of Dear White People supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as the director of the film. Damon replied harshly that the choice of the twin could lead to an undesirable outcome.
When the conversation was on TV, the social media exploded from Damon's evil comments.
The Twitter user, Mr.Pooni, expressed his anger about the scene with direct words: "The fact that Matt Damon talks on the only person in the dark to explain what diversity is, is so white-skinned that it hurts."
The suite was divided more than 5,000 times and four thousand times was liked.
Damon's comments are at a time when the media has a balanced representation of the human race.
After the death of a teenager Michael Brown from a white police bullet in 2014, Black Lives Matter received support throughout the country.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the release of the year's album candidates at the Grammys.
"The albums still matter," he said.
"Just like books and dark-skinned lives, albums still matter."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter published the opinion in response to the question by the Fow News Elisabeth Hasselbeck as to whether this group should be characterised as a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter network is a love-based group," said the management of the movement.
Damon is one of the entertainment artists, producers and media moguls invited to the Pope to discuss the picture of the Catholic Church in the Western world.
It is not known whether Damon has responded positively to the call.
The first winner in the American Ninja Warrior series
A professional climber and a vessel collector named Isaac Caldiero took the first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and signed off on his winnings for a million dollars.
During the seventh season of the TV series, for the first time, all the tasks assigned were examined.
In the final episode of the season, Caldiero and photographer Geoff Britten survived the last round.
In the last task, men had to hurt a 23-metre rope up to 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the task within the time given. He was the first to perform the fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior race with approval, but Caldiero was three seconds faster than the task and won.
After a tough fight, Caldiero told E!News he was still in shock after he caught a million dollars pot.
"The winning amount is incredible, because I've never made more than $10,000 a year," he said in an E! interview about his winning bet.
"One day, I can't even imagine what's coming from this, the future is completely open."
Kent Weed, the responsible producer, talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Britten is not rewarded, even though he was the first competitor to explain all the tasks.
"The rules say the fastest to win the prize money.
If more competitors solve all the tasks, the fastest win", Weed explained.
"Of course, the money prize is wonderful and will revolutionize life, but also Britten will be satisfied with his performance.
I don't think he's gonna stay here and talk about it any more.
He's just happy with his performance.
He has received a lot of praise from the fans.
Britten's a great guy for whom the family is important.
His children and his wife think he's a hero.
Geoff told me that since he didn't win himself, he played the victory preferably on Isaac.
He also believes that Isaac would have thought the same of him if the situation had been different."
American Ninja Warrior renewed for the eighth season, whose descriptions start in spring 2016.

Simon (13-9) fed 6 1/2 shifts of good game and allowed three runs.
He's only had three good beginnings on nine missions.
"I just want to end the season strongly this year," Simon said.
"It's hard for a married person to throw at every game, and that's why I want to feed it to the sixth shift."
Victor Martinez, the replacement of Tigers' pitcher, got three hits and hit two runs that were his first hit after mid-August.
It was Martinez's first night of three hits after he got four hits against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He beat well," said Aumus.
"He looks good at punching exercises and kept up the game."
On the seventh shift, Twins had the best chance of getting back into the game.

Tigers got three runs in the first two shifts against the right-handed concarcer who had just gotten back on the list of injured in the field. The man was on the side for a month because of the inflammation of the back.
"The beginning was, of course, not what I would have hoped for. However, as the game progressed, I began to feel more comfortable, and I was able to perform and get a few good feeds in the third shift," Hughes said.
When he got in charge, Hughes hit Ian Kinsler in the first shift.
The real copier J.D. Martinez's free play brought Victor Martinez the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 tube broke when the team had players at the nest.

Tigers added his lead in the second shift. The kidnapper James McCann survived hitting second base and Anthony Gose first base, when the situation was between 3 and 0.
"It's a hit," commented Coach Twins Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit very well, but he hit the right spot."
At the pass was Hughes, who entered the scoreless third shift, after which he was replaced with the right-handed substituter A.J. Achter.
Three runs, six hits, a free throw, and four straight feeds became Hughes' balance.
Notable: Tigers' right-hand batter Anibal Sanchez was not involved in the formation due to the rip-off.

Tigers and Twins will finish their three-game series on Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, running value: 4.43) is met by Ervin Santana (5-4, running value: 4.73).
