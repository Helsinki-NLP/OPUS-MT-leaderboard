Changes in business support practices - Province - Regions - News - Karjalainen
In addition to EU corporate aid, the management of national business aid will be concentrated in four EY centres from mid-September onwards.
In Eastern Finland, the Ely Centre of Southern Savo is responsible for its activities in Mikkeli.
Under the new Act on Business Aid, which entered into force at the beginning of July, EU structural funds should no longer be allocated to large enterprises unless they are completely new.
The subsidiaries of more than five thousand municipalities are also considered to be great municipalities.
On the other hand, EU support for investment that improves the business conditions of municipalities can continue to be granted.
In Eastern Finland, the EU and national support management unit will have a strength of about 30 people.
At least for the time being, they will all continue to work in their existing establishments.
Kalevi Pölönen, Head of the Structural Funds Unit of the Ely Centre of South Savo, for example, is in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is now pursuing in Ukraine
Russia is acting consistently, even if it does not always seem so.
Head of the National Defence College Strategy Institute, Colonel, Docent Torsti Siren was not surprised by the conflicting news of Ukraine on Monday morning.
This has been the same thing for a long time, siren says.
On the other hand, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire and stated that Russia would not attack Ukraine (read more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine reports that its parachutists are currently fighting with the Russian tank department near Luhansk Airport and that the tank department has received confirmations (read more here).
Mr Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire in the Minsk negotiations without any conditions.
Russia denies its involvement and needs to get the outcome of the negotiations up to date so that they can establish their position in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That's the whole point, siren says.
This is the big picture: suddenly we need to start negotiating and precisely so that Russia can get its grip on the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
Finnair externalises cabin services for the Norwegian company, vacations people
Finnair begins to purchase cabin services as a subcontractor from the Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation.
The agreement concerns the routes of Finnair to Hong Kong and Singapore, but is due to be extended at a later stage.
In total, the layout of the two routes leads to a reduction of about 100 person-years’ work in Finland, which will be carried out at the first stage on leave, the company reported in its notice.
In addition, about 80 Asian temporary agency workers are out of work at the time the routes are externalised.
Finnair already told us in June that it intends to outsource about 20 routes of passenger services over the next two years.
The deployments were concluded when no agreement was reached with the staff on savings.
The appearances are due to begin in January-March next year.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation will also continue with other partners.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of neurotic back pain, i.e. sciatica pain, with those who are working hard to work.
Firemen were followed for 13 years by a study carried out by the Institute of Health at work.
The connection of sleep disorders to the sciatica tree is surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and endurance of firefighters, which are regularly tested, do not seem to protect against pain, says the research director, Sirpa Lusa, in the health service’s newsletter.
The work of firefighters is an irregular shift work, where shifts can stretch for up to 24 hours.
According to the Agency, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey carried out in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you know the surprising new causes of water damage?
Easy to cause damage to other dwellings
Water damage Water damage is not always caused by leaking pipes or taps, as is the expert of the host association.
We have received contacts when the breakage of the aquarium has caused water damage in the building company that it is possible to ban the aquariums, says Marina Furuhjelm, the legal expert of the host association.
Furohijelm points out that only pipes and sewers are not the common cause of water damage, but also more and more new machinery, such as ice-breakers, have caused water leaks in housing.
Many do not know that machines such as washing machines or washing machines must not be left unattended.
The tap shall also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, as the pressure in the pipes may otherwise lead to water leakage.
A resident may be considered to be guilty of negligence if these obligations have been neglected, in which case the person is liable for the damage.
Of course, in these cases, home insurance can compensate for the damage, depending on the conditions of the insurance and the case.
If it can be demonstrated that the resident has caused carelessness, the person will be liable.
If a resident has passed out in a shower on top of a floor well, neglect can often be proven because, in these cases, the water is flooded elsewhere and the caretaker comes to the apartment where the deceased resident is found.
Furuhjelm tells us that due to the generalisation of the sinking of the floor wells, many student apartments are now equipped with two floor wells in the shower rooms.
Water damage has also been caused by water beds, although no longer to the extent that they were more popular in the past.
Even the dog’s water cup and the fall of domestic wine can become real water damage.
I also know that there were many cats in the apartment that had peed on the floors so that there were widespread damage, Furuhjelm says.
The principle of liability for the correction always goes the same way unless the company’s statutes provide otherwise.
The shareholder is responsible for repairing the surface material and damage to the construction of the building company and damage to other dwellings.
Water damage causes damage to other apartments easily because the structure of concrete really easily absorbs water.
According to Furohijelm, battery leaks in housing are particularly difficult because batteries leak easily into structures.
Water damage can be caused by today’s increased air heat pumps that produce condensation water.
Water should lead to a solid sewer or a network of rainwater, not just a vessel.
The shareholder is also responsible for removing water, snow, ice and garbage from the balcony, advises the legal expert.
Furohilem advises that, although the rules of the building company do not require, for example, permanent removal of the washing machine, there may be a condition under which compensation may be denied.
You might want to be careful with your own home insurance policy.
However, I consider washing machines, for example, to be a large risk of water drains that are derived from the tub, which have caused many damage.
I recommend that the drains should always be permanently channelled into the sewers.
The removal of snow and water on the balcony
Control of washing machines, washing machines, etc., while on.
Water tap closure (washing machine and dishwasher)
Clearing the floor well partially twice a year.
It is recommended that the effluents be permanently connected.
Check the taps and any leaks.
Regular freezer melting
Do you have any experience with water damage?
Tell me about your experiences in the commentary?
FC Honka lost again and turned into a serial jumbo.
At the Tapiola Sports Park, two of the weakest teams in the current moment met the football Veikkausliiga gymnast on Sunday night.
In June, the last FC Honka to celebrate victory hosted seven games in the unbeatable tube of the sailed Vaasa Ball Society.
VPS just won his previous victory against Honka in July.
On Sunday, the encounter with the suburbs came to a good seam, as VPS had long returned to the winning position with a count of 2-1.
Before the game Olli Huttunen, the main coach of the vases, complained about the inefficiency of his team, but the confused Honka defense facilitated VPS' paint-making problems.
Pelibly very nervous to perform.
We didn't get any more attacks at all, we didn't get a hold of the ball," Huttunen estimates his own performance.
In the first half of Honga's top-notch, Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played with great uncertainty.
Both of the vases were born as a result of the free play of the toppers.
The opening painting of the match was only seen after five minutes of the game, when Steven Morrissey directed the shot of Sebastian Strandvall by the foolish Honka goalkeeper Walter Viila.
I'm sorry about the first half.
By the field the team did the opposite of what was agreed before the game", Honga's head coach Shefki Kuqi mani.
After the initial shock, the midwives got their game together and rolled the ball at the head of the attack.
Especially the midfield player Carlos Portela and the winger Roni Porokara were eager to find places to play, but the last solutions were almost often lame.
The closest goal was Honga’s central field man, Jussi Vasara, whose 20-metre launch was, however, slightly past the VPS paint.
VPS hit effectively against using its whimsical attackers and Honga's diabolical top-upper.
At half an hour, the vases scored 2-0 when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart made it through each other.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was on a good start in the opening session and repeatedly created situations on the left side.
The speed of Stewart, on the other hand, seemed to be too much for the frontal defense throughout the game.
"In the middle of the day, if we lose, we lose with honor," Kuqi said.
In the second episode, the insatiable Honka sought a fiercely narrowing paint.
The team was twice close to the hit until the third attempt was successful.
The blacksmith Yerai Vilaboa finished the goal in the middle of the penalty zone.
After the Vilaboa goal, Honga had half an hour to even the match.
The Espoo team took more and more risks, which allowed VPS to engage in dangerous counterattacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey were able to get along with Viita, but the shady fights of the Honka goalkeeper kept the home team in the game.
At the end of the day, Honka was a little tired, and he didn't get any more goals.
With the loss, Honka was the last to pass the Vesika League, while there are seven more matches left.
Journal: Putin was proud to take Kiev in two weeks
Russian President Vladimir Putin was quite loud in the telephone conversation with the President of the EU Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, says the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
Putin expressed his frustration at the European Union's plans to blackmail sanctions against Russia.
If I want, I can take Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica tells me Putin said so.
According to the paper, Putin's message to Barroso was this: it is not worth annoying Russia with new sanctions.
Putin gave the first channel of Russian television an interview about the crisis in Ukraine on Sunday night.
Putin said in the interview that he would keep the conflict fully internal to Ukraine and that he would urge the Government of Kiev to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiev very much about the shooting of civilian targets in Eastern Ukraine.
Russia "can't stand by" if people are shot to death at a distance, Putin said.
Esko Roine admits: The actor's work destroyed the family
The hard work of the Confector and the theatre family grew to recognize how the actor’s profession destroyed his first marriage.
Actress Esko Roine will be 70 next Friday, but for her, I think it's a valid saying that age is just a number.
I don't see any difference compared to the year before, or two years ago, or ten years ago.
The spiritual puberty seems to continue, Esko Roine says.
Roine's been retired for years, but she's still working for a lot of men.
Sometimes it was a joke that there were not many plays in this country without Esko Roine.
At the moment, Roine has roles in the Helsinki City Theatre's play How to succeed in business, the Tampere Workers' Theatre's Adviser and the Tampere Comedy Theatre's Quartet.
Roine is also seen in the future Risto Rapper movie.
PHOTO: Reijo Hietanen
The roine's actress's career didn't start promisingly.
I wasn't good enough for a Tiernaboy picture at school.
40 to 50 years later, the teacher said it was because I was so bad.
Esko Roine wasn't discouraged.
The career choice was clear. There was no choice.
It felt close and loving.
I was so busy in the field that I dropped out of school and went to the army as a volunteer just to get to the theater school as soon as possible.
Roine has done some 200 theatre roles and 300 TV shows, depending on how you count.
If things are calculated like Englishmanns, that every part of the TV series has its own show, then there are over 600 TV cases.
I was three years in a new day, which was made three episodes a week.
The other spring, I was killed when I didn't have time to do it.
Commitments for autumn 2016
Esko's big sisters Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full swing and are still doing the wild roles of anarchist grandmothers in Tampere's Workers' Theatre.
The little brother's gonna be on the edges for years.
That's what it looks like now, but you don't know who this is.
You always have to take a small reservation that I'll come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
The calendar has reservations for autumn 2016.
For years, they've left their mark on a man.
Age doesn't come alone.
The knees are operated, the hip is whistled and the joint is broken, but when you don't let it get too upset, they'll get you, Esko Roine says.
Roine became familiar to the TV audience, for example.
From the pirate radio and a sketch of Antti Einio, he was sharing crops with hundreds of dollars of banknotes.
It was Antti Einiö who divided crops.
I was trying to tell them they were hundreds, not crops.
In the Reinikainen series, Roine was a vain Lieutenant Ironallion.
He became Tampere's favorite police officer in the department when he happened to be a lieutenant in the same position.
A cop stopped the car on the street, took the window open and yelled at me, "That iron ball is great!"
Successful working group
The theatre works in Roine's mind have remained, for example.
Producer and Master Class of Helsinki City Theatre, Death of Tampere People's Theatre Trade Passenger and Long Day trip to Tampere Theatre for the night.
It is all about the fact that the presentations have been popular.
It's not because of me. It's because the task force has succeeded.
There's been a series of rhinestones, too.
Pekka Woodhead's role in the film is one of those.
There are others.
The reason is that I've agreed too easily.
I don't know if I'm sorry about those roles, but the outcome is not for me, nor for the viewers.
As a row actor, you can't choose your own jobs.
It's only been nice to do what I've been told.
In addition to theatre work, Roine has also tried to make a success in business.
In the '80s he held a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot in Tampere.
It was a teaching experience.
It was nothing when I tried to be the director of the Tampere Theatre at the same time, the actor, and then the cooker.
If I remember correctly, within a year, it became clear that they could not be reconciled with anything.
Typically, when the show was over or in the middle of the day, and I had time to think if I was going to put on a sauna, the restaurant became a call that there were your friends here hoping to see you after the show.
Memories for the Birthday
On his birthday, Esko Roine's memoirs appear, as ghost writers Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
They've created some kind of hillbilly from the face-wagon's memory.
At one time in Zoom, when I was playing, I was called a face-wrecker.
It's not like I've known them by name.
The book has been done for years.
Roine used to tell me that no news bombs are allowed because she hasn't done anything so rude, or if she has, she won't tell me.
I made a small opening phrase in the book.
I'm saying that if anyone's waiting for scandalous revelations or good gossip, you should stop reading this.
There's a lot of work going on there, as an actor when he's a theater director.
The publisher notes that there is also a competition from the crazy theatre school time.
It was kind of a normal student life, but a kid came to do all-looking tricks.
It wasn't as wild as it was in Turka's day.
It was very different.
I don't know how much from there I got more than self-assurance, that when school's gone so far, it's not gonna be up to it if things don't get better.
You didn't have to think how good I'd be if I went to school.
Roine also remembers the legends of the National Theatre.
I became friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Mann, and Hannes Härinen, and I was able to work with them.
After all, there were legends from my first father-in-law, Kaarlo Holdtus.
Soon Hattara and I had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I got to know him in high school.
The middle son of the fire, Martti, was on the same course as me.
At the theatre school, Roine met her first wife, Marjukka Halttunen.
And as a matter of pain, he's reminiscing his divorce.
After a relatively long battle, the children were shared.
Not in two parts, but in the way that the daughter went to my mother and the boy to me.
I did not think it was a good decision, and I understand that the children now agree in some way with adults.
In theatre circles, it is not uncommon for silver to be divided.
In my case, some part of it was that I worked pretty hard at the time.
I was in the theater almost every case.
Then there was television and radio on top of it.
I did a long day, and my family was suffering.
It might be a night off on the day of the party.
Esko Roine celebrates Tampere’s Workers’ Theatre at the Adviser on 7 September.
The festival continues at Helsinki City Theatre on 21 and 28 September.
The adversary's gonna gloat there, too.
I was 50 years old at work, 60 years old at work.
When such an easy - to - move play happened, I thought we'd get them out of here with a single rhythm.
According to Roine, there's no party expenses on her birthday.
I remember it's the night off, but I'm not going to swear.
I may have missed something for that day.
Or it's a strange night off I'm gonna have on the night off, Roine says.
Aviation companies are concerned about the production chain
Some of the smaller manufacturers in the UK are concerned that the production capacity problems in the supply chain may derail the ambitious plans of large aircraft manufacturers to increase the production of passenger aircraft.
In the UK, thousands of companies in the production chain of aircraft manufacture are currently enjoying an unexpected large number of simultaneous aircraft and engine development plans.
Aviation and defence
At the same time as some people are enjoying the order amount, warnings have been issued about capacity problems and price pressure at the production chain’s disposal.
"It is absolutely true that price pressure exists, especially now that production is challenging," says Craig Gallagher, Director General of MB Aerospace, one of the main suppliers of aircraft engines such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, the CEO of the North West Aerospace Alliance, representing some 240 suppliers of aircraft production in the north-west of England, says that more capacity is needed.
"Do strategies and investment plans respond to these growth plans?
To be honest, I'm not quite sure.
Above all, we need more investment in new production equipment and machinery, which are needed to achieve these production volumes," says Gallagher.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in aircraft building are part of the problem.
According to Andrew Churchill, the CEO of JJ Chrurchill, producing the wings of gas turbines, the company has a 'challenging time' when several new building plans began to be implemented at the same time at the beginning of the year.
We immediately moved from very little production to a space where production capacity exceeded.
Many orders were only paid afterwards, and in addition, we had to try to push forward.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans," Churchill says.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by placing £800 000 on new machines and hiring 26 new employees.
Several operators believe that investment and coordination between small suppliers are needed if the United Kingdom wants to maintain its position as the second largest operator in the aviation sector after the United States.
The chairman of Ford Aerospace and the engineer of fine mechanics in Tyneside, Geoff Ford, says that the order amount should increase producer confidence and want to expand and increase production capacity, as work should be sufficient.
"If this doesn't happen, we'll lose the competition against other countries," says Ford.
Some major players are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
The company that manufactured FTSE 250 aeroplanes and engines purchased the parts of the aircraft operating in Malaysia by UPECA at GBP 75 million.
MB Aerospace bought companies from North America and Poland last year.
"It is possible to buy start-up companies that create new activities, but in reality, production is most slowed down by the limited design and the number of engineers," says Gallagher, of MB Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price pressure that has passed on to them from large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engine manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of operators in the production chain are exaggerated.
Marcus Bryson, head of the GKN Aeroplane Production Unit, who is also a representative of the UK aviation trade, believes that the production chain has been better dealing with the problem than it has been in previous years.
There is pressure in the supply chain, but I would not describe the situation as critical.
"The introduction of new technology and advanced processes is more important than the currents," says Bryson.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned about mistakes and are now more careful not to increase the number of buildings too quickly.
As Boeing tried to increase its production in 1997, it faced great difficulties when the company lost and the factories and the production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, Director of the Rolls Royce Aeroplane Production Department, says that the company has not yet encountered problems in the production chain, which delivers most of the 18 000 parts needed for the production of the jet engine.
"You will certainly have a pitfall, but we believe that we have done a more thorough work on the supply chain by choosing the best partners and keeping in touch with the suppliers as they prepare to increase their activity," says Wood.
According to Boeing’s CEO James McNerney, the company’s production chain has had time to anticipate an increase in supply volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have been open to journalists, which is very important.
The CEO of the Airbus passenger jet production unit, Fabrice Brégier, says that the company will do its utmost to reduce the risks related to its plans to increase the production of the A350 model to 10 machines per month by 2018.
"Maybe one of the journalists will not succeed, and it is our job to try to prevent this situation as well as to support journalists and look for alternatives, but we have to wait for great problems," Brégier says.
Bregiér says that Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: "The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the editor.
So this is both my job and that of Airbus."
Hong Kong protesting groups will launch an "an era of civil disobedience" in Beijing's ban on open elections
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
Democracy-supporting activists spread out to the streets of Hong Kong after China has rejected the requirements for their open elections.
The groups in favour of Hong Kong's democracy stress that the demonstrations can and will ensure that the city begins to oppose the reforms proposed by the Chinese Government in respect of the elections.
Thousands of protestors fought the coming rain against Hong Kong's glamorous horizon as they marched into the demonstration by the Occupy Central Group in favour of democracy in front of the Council's premises in charge of the implementation of the laws on Sunday night, where the protestors urged people to participate in a broad sit-down demonstration in order to undermine the city's financial quarter.
The demonstration took place only hours after Beijing had announced that it would deny voters the right to propose candidates in public in the mayor's elections in 2017, thus undermining the months-long demonstrations that will further increase the city's divide.
The protesters participate in the beginning of the demonstration of the Occupy Central movement in front of the central government buildings in Hong Kong.
"We want a fair and decent election," says Dion Tse, a 24-year-old Web site operator, who participated in a Sunday demonstration with his 50-year-old mother Wong Chi-yi.
The government doesn't respect the Hong Kong voice.
We want the government to listen to us and see Hong Kong's determination.
The Chinese People's Congress of China's Supreme Laws adopted plans for electoral changes, allowing only two candidates to participate in the first direct elections in Hong Kong.
However, the approval of the 1200-person Nomination Committee is required for the candidate, and opposition politicians believe that this effectively prevents different political views from getting into the electoral flags.
The protesters participate in the demonstration organised in connection with the Occupy Central Love and Peace test, which was carried out in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong Government Building.
According to police estimates, over 2,600 people were currently involved in the demonstration.
A large number of police officers followed when some 100 protestors led by the Scholarism Student Group gathered late on Sunday for Grand Hyatt, where Li Fein, Member of the Communist Party, was to stay after his arrival in Beijing.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of the Occupy Central, participated in a press conference with members of the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism and Federation of Students.
Or not in order to comply with the law, said the exact date on which road blockage would take place, but called on participants to follow closely the development of the situation in the next few weeks, while adding that the city will officially move to the "time of civil disobedience".
Benny Tai answers the press's questions.
"Look at the person next to you," he said in a Sunday's demonstration, standing in front of a billboard of two disobedient characters in China.
That man takes control of the center with you!
Joshua Wong, a 17-year-old student of Scholarism, said earlier that preparations for the demonstrations of high school students are under way and are planned to be held at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to express their opinion by refusing to teach.
"In addition to academic responsibility, we have our social responsibility," says Wong.
In Beijing, Deputy Secretary General Li Fei of the People's Congress Committee told journalists that the defence of the 'international requirements' of the general right to vote is a waste of time and comes from some Hong Kong politicians who are trying to 'ble society and mislead it'.
"Unpractical proposals such as the appointment of a public candidate have wasted a lot of time," says Li, demanding that the way of elections be created in such a way as to fit the real situation of each society and the legal framework.
A law on the general right to vote can only be adopted if a large majority, i.e. two-thirds of the Hong Kong 70-person legislative body, supports this, which means that 27 opposition members of the government can stop the initiative.
Mr Li warned that Hong Kong might be withdrawn from a lengthy political debate if the reform proposal was rejected by veto.
"It would harm business and the development of the city," he says.
Almost 800 000 people voted in an informal poll organised by the Occupy Central movement in June to oppose the Chinese requirements, and according to requirements, the candidate needs the approval of the committee.
Up to 172 000 people marched for democracy on 1 July, while the march in favour of Beijing and against the Occupy Central movement on 17 August attracted some 88 000 participants, with estimates from the figures coming from the University of Hong Kong, although the estimates of the police and the organisers differ considerably from these figures.
Three injured by lightning on the beach of New York.
In a lightning strike on a beach in New York City, three people were injured.
According to the fire department, men were injured on the Orchard Beach beach in Pelham Bay, Bronx, on Sunday night, when the storms crossed the area.
The injured men are in hospital.
The extent of the injuries is unknown.
The lightning struck when the heavy thunderstorms were sweeping across the city.
Storm rains, thunder and weather interrupted the Labor Day weekend celebration and the U.S. Open tennis match in Queens and forced the music festival to close early on East River Island.
The tens of commercial flights arriving at city airports were late due to bad weather.
A new idea is not supposed to please
This is the latest instructions for network users for employees and managers and is shared by Harvey Schachter, author of the Monday Morning Manager website.
Entrepreneur Seth Godin says it's a good idea to recognize comments like "I don't like it" or "I don't understand."
If this is not the case, the idea is probably popular and self-evident – i.e. boring and everyday – or its benefits are so limited that it is not worth pursuing.
As a historian, Harvard Drew Gilpin never repeated anything that had already been published so that people would not think that he had nothing new to offer.
Now, as head of the university, he repeats the same thing several times in order to get the message to a large extent.
Advertising consultant Bob Hoffman thinks that TV and radio are the best tools to generate demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more people are reading news about the network does not mean that the Internet is good between advertising – just as the first phone was a popular means of communication but a bad option for advertisers.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson states that one word is enough to motivate workers: together.
In one study, participants were told that they would solve the problem as a cooperation, although in fact they were working alone in an empty room. These participants worked longer and solved more problems than those who were not told about the cooperation at the outset.
If the task is to find a repetitive pattern or relationship between two units, Dave Paradi, the performer, advises you to forget Microsoft's SmartArt and instead use the Chartmer.com program, where you can choose between 14 different relationships.
Mount Stuart hospital cataract surgery banning due to safety risk
The specialist doctor has been suspended temporarily, and the UK national health system NHS ceased to direct patients to that private hospital for cataract surgery after the hospital problems were raised.
Two people applied to Torbay Hospital after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay Hospital in Devon has said that they have been in contact with 19 patients who were treated on 26 July and have called them "fast clinical trials".
The Mount Stuart hospital regretted the matter and said that it had been examined since the doctor was dismissed.
It came to the attention of Torbay Hospital when two patients treated at Mount Stuart applied for its emergency care because of eye problems.
According to Torbay Hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients who were all studied on the same day had required surgery.
The Torbay Hospital and the South Devon and Torbay Hospital have not directed patients to treatment with Mount Stuart since problems arose.
David Sinclair, temporary head of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation, head of Torbay Hospital, said that "we have identified the problem in its early stages and were able to contact all the patients concerned quickly.
Whenever we direct patients to the care provider, we perform quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the latest legal requirements and that its licensing matters are in order.
According to the head of patient safety in the South Devon and Torbay Hospital District, Gill Gant, "patient safety is always an absolute number one, so it is important that these cataracts are not performed until we can be absolutely sure that the treatment is safe".
Ramsay Health Care UK, who manages Mount Stuart Hospital, "seriously apologized to all patients who experienced complications".
The company was announced that "a week after we learned about the possible problem, we and later the Torbay hospital were called to all the patients concerned".
This specialist doctor has been licensed by Ramsay Health Care since 2005 and has been registered as a doctor since 1989.
To date, he has performed 4 537 cataract surgery in various parts of the organization. According to statistics, the clinical results of the surgery he has performed have been excellent and the rate of complications has been less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor has been suspended temporarily until the case has been examined.
What's "4chan"?
The evil anonymous communication site was the first to publish leaked nudity photos of celebrities.
What exactly is "4chan", and why was it the hacker's first option when he published the images he stole?
"4chan" was established in 2003. It is a communication website that has raised the debate, which is being called as much as it is praised.
The site is divided into several parts, known as bulletin boards, where anonymous users can discuss all possible, video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other online forums, users do not create a single, continuously used profile and their publications are not kept.
On the most popular notice tables, comments may disappear in less than a minute when more recent publications replace them at the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchist and surprising creative atmosphere in "4chan".
The anonymous members of the community have created some of the most famous forms of the network (such as "rickrolling" and "lolcats"), but the lack of rules on the site has also resulted in a great deal of questionable or criminal content on the site.
The most popular notification table on this site is /b/, which is intended for mixed discussions and is regularly published with NSFW content (Not Safe For Work).
This may contain tame porn, but also brutal and shocking pictures. An anonymous hacker published stolen photos of famous celebrities on this particular notice board during the weekend.
American CytRx invests in the research and development of anticancer drugs
The aim of CytRx is to cure cancer – or at least slow it down.
A company in Los Angeles that produces biological drugs, which recently became the subject of a dispute caused by the efficiency of shares, specializes in the research and development of anticancer drugs.
The most promising medicine is aldoxorubicin, which is a more advanced form of doxorubicin commonly used in chemotherapy.
CytRx performs clinical trials using aldoxorubicin for soft tissue sarcoma, AIDS-related Kapos sarcoma and renewable glioblastoma or brain tumours.
It's like a controlled missile that goes directly into the tumour and not into the rest of the body, says CEO Steven Kriegsman of CytRx about the anticancer medicine aldoxorubicin.
Aldoxorubicin contains the so-called combined technology that acts like a Trojan horse.
It binds directly in the blood to a protein that also accumulates in tumours, allowing the medicine to pass directly into cancer cells.
The compound only donates the medicine in an acidic environment, the cancer cells, but not in healthy tissue.
This technology allows the patient to receive a higher dose of anticancer medicine.
"It's like a missile that passes directly into the tumor and not into the rest of the body," says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on the development of medicines, CytRx does not make a profit.
This year, the company sold shares and thus collected 86 million dollars to maintain operations and research.
CytRx is currently looking for 400 patients worldwide in a critical 3-phase clinical trial for alternative soft tissue sarcoma.
Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in the soft tissue of the body, such as the blood vessels, muscles and fat tissue.
Alternative therapy is used for the treatment of cancer when the initial treatment is not effective.
If the clinical investigation is successful, CytRx plans to apply for authorisation from the U.S. Food and Medicines Administration already in 2016, says Kriegsman.
The medicine could then be approved for use in 2017.
Analysts say that data published by CytRx from a previous clinical trial in December showed that aldoxorubicin is a promising treatment for soft tissue sarcoma.
"For a long time, the question was, "We haven't seen any clinical data on how different it is from the medicine itself," says Andrew Fein, analyst of H.C. Wainwright & Co.
The publication of the results confirmed the opinion of many that this treatment is different.
Fein says, however, that it is difficult to predict the results and schedule of the current clinical trial, because it differs significantly from the previous study that produced good results.
"Many things have to go right," he says.
Fein compares drug development with the mining industry.
"At first, a lot of money will be invested in finding that one gold vein, and the investment will continue for so long that that gold vein will be found," he says.
The money will be spent on research and development for so long that the medicine can be commercialised.
Several shareholders have called on CytRx to go to court because they believe that it gave a better picture of its success.
In the action, the company is accused of employing an investment company called DreamTeam Group, which allegedly hired people to write positive comments about CytRx and another biotech company, such as Forbes, Seeking Alphan, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the case-law, the articles did not show that the companies paid fees to the authors.
As a result of the news, Seeking Alpha announced that it had removed articles "that were contrary to practice".
Several articles on the company were also removed from other websites.
Kriegsman refused to comment on the accusations.
The company has hired an outside lawyer to respond to the appeals.
"I have no time or energy to focus on this," says Kriegsman.
According to him, the real challenge facing CytRx is to find talented workers who tend to work in biotech centres such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"This is in many ways the wilderness from the point of view of the pharmaceutical industry," he says.
Analyst’s views
The price of CytRx’s shares rose to $8.08 on 10 January and then fell to less than $3 in April when the accusations concerning the advertising of the shares were made public.
According to Analyst magazine, the case-law and the negative publicity have been lower than the price of the shares than their real value.
"It's unfortunate," Fein says, "but I'm not sure if there's any easy way to pass this thing as long as the concept is valid."
In the name of the law, a cop's cameraman was killed in the middle of the shootings.
The photographer of a series based on true events, even in the name of the Law, died on Tuesday night when he was shot in the middle of a shooting incident.
The cameraman described the shooting between a police patrol in his own country and a suspect in armed robbery at a fast food restaurant when he was hit by bullets.
He died quickly from injuries he suffered.
According to the TMZ site, a suspect in armed robbery died in the shooting incident, in addition to a cameraman.
A series of the first real-time TV programmes in the name of the Law has been presented in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, the series has been presented on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The question of an outsider is raised in the court court proceedings that started today when Ulvila was killed.
Anneli Auer is accused of the murder of her husband Jukka S. Lahti in 2006.
For the second time, the court court in Vaasa will deal with the case, for the Supreme Court returned it to the district court with a new evidence.
The purpose of the court's ruling is that the judgment is still to be delivered on the side of this year.
The court court court in Vaasa released Auer in 2011.
The Court then considered the possibility of an external author to be sufficiently likely.
In his opening speech, DA Kalle Kulmala explained the prosecutor's view of the night of the murder and of the circumstances that exclude the possibility of an outsider.
In our opinion, the crucial question is whether the house has become an external factor that has killed Jukka Lahti in the way and in time told by Anneli Auer.
It is about the credibility of Anneli Auer's report," Kulmala said.
According to the prosecutor, the church began a family dispute during which Auer had announced that he would leave home and seek divorce.
At some point, they moved to a kitchen where Lahti held onto Auer and tried to stop him from leaving.
One of them took the kitchen knife," Kalmala described the events of the night of the death on Monday.
According to the D.A., a number of factors prove that there was no external factor.
For example, there are no votes on the emergency call tape.
The oldest kid in Auer's house, his daughter, in the interview, told me he saw the man who did it when he left the garage door.
The judgment of the State Court, issued in 2011, was partly based on the daughter’s report.
According to the D.A., a daughter's observation cannot be correct.
"The daughter didn't see an outsider in the parents' bedroom, even though she visited there twice," said Kulmala.
The prosecutor's new witness is just connected to the possibility of an outsider.
Jukka S. Lahti's sister has been telling us about the events since the night of the murder in the hospital.
According to the woman, the only thing her daughter told me at the hospital was that she only saw Lahti's body when she was at the murder scene in the fireplace room.
Mr Auer's defense is going to present to the court lines of inquiry, which according to the police have not been sufficiently investigated.
Three years ago, when the court court court of Vaasa released Auer from the charge, the court considered the DNA of a foreign man found in the hug as one of the references to an outsider.
The sample later turned out to be the DNA of a scientist working in a Central Crime Police lab.
Then a DNA sample was taken as a mass sample from 700 people.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigation lines were excluded," said Juha Manner, defense attorney.
One of the new witnesses in the defense is about a possible external factor.
The Ulvilian woman told the police about a man of Porilaism who, according to her, had confessed to the act.
The police questioned the man this summer.
The D.A. decided that the Porilasm man had nothing to do with the homicide.
The D.A. made a request for an investigation because the D.A. suspects that she was lying in her report.
One of the new witnesses in the defense is a nurse who was working at the Satakunta Central Hospital the night of the death.
A hundred district courts sentenced Auer to life imprisonment for murder last December.
According to the District Court judgment, there are wars against the possibility of an outsider, such as the Auer children's reports, the absence of sounds from the emergency storage of the outsider and the time required for events to take place.
The verdict came in two to one.
The minority judge wrote that the evidence in the criminal case must be interpreted as being in the interest of the accused.
Therefore, the daughter’s report must be interpreted as meaning that, despite the contradictions in the report, she had discovered that the outsider was leaving the fireplace door.
Auer's two oldest children have been called court-martial hearings.
The daughter was first heard in person last year in 100 district court.
In court, he no longer remembered the events of the night of the murder.
Auer’s second oldest child named his mother the killer in a video interview in 2011.
The boy told me he heard the events of the night of the murder behind the closed door.
He also told me that Auer was planning to kill for six months.
As an agent, the boy has no obligation to say anything in court.
Court proceedings continue today with the consultation of Anneli Auer.
If necessary, the Auer hearing will continue tomorrow.
Anneli Auer is currently serving more than seven years in prison for sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin be allowed to attend the G20?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him the number one enemy.
Putin is due to attend the G20 summit in Brisbane in November, and Australia is having a heated debate on whether or not its entry should be allowed.
The punkrock Activist Group Pussy Riot called on Australia to ban Putin's participation in the summit, with over 4 000 representatives from the most influential countries in the world.
"This person, in our opinion, has nothing to do with the G20 meeting," said Maria Alyokhina to the public at Sydney's fully packed opera house in connection with the Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Kiev has warned that he is on the brink of a "perfect war", and Putin calls parts of Ukraine "Novorossia" or "the new Russia".
Tony Abbott's been saying, "He's weighing the decision."
According to Mike Callaghan, head of the G20 unit of the Lowy Institute Research Centre, Australians cannot decide who will attend the meeting, even if the meeting is held in the country.
"Australia may decide who it lets into the country, but this is an international meeting," she says.
Just as when New York hosts UN meetings, or when Washington hosts the International Monetary Fund meetings, "it is not up to the host to ban someone called to come," says Callaghan.
Last week, Tony Abbott said that he was "simplifying the decision" after Russia's defamatory actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important issue.
Since Putin is coming to a very important international meeting, Australia has no right to decide on its own.
"There is, however, an important issue that I will consider a lot, and I believe that other countries will do so in the coming weeks," he says.
People attend an anti-war meeting in Mariupol, Eastern Ukraine.
The event will take two days and will involve a wide variety of representatives of the world's largest and fastest-growing economies, with a total population of about two thirds of the world's population representing 85% of world GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as some of the specially invited guests from non-G20 countries such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia had a questionable task of balancing the various interests under great public pressure.
In his view, the prime minister's best approach is to take advantage of the opportunity to press Russia to speak publicly about its recent actions.
"The Prime Minister should say that we are going to take this opportunity to seek a very open dialogue and that he will demand President Putin to make an account of his actions."
If Putin comes to the meeting, it is his duty to report on his actions," Callaghan says.
There is clear evidence of an increase in geopolitical pressure.
I think the world expects them to bring these things up.
Russian-minded rebels are preparing weapons to attack Ukrainian military bases at Donetsk Airport in eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether Puti will attend the meeting, and Callaghan says that this is not necessarily known until a few days in advance.
I'm sure this is the last thing in Putin's mind.
He is hardly saying that 'I must change my attitude towards Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November'.
Bill Shorten, the opposition leader, takes Putin's view of the arrival in Australia, "very reserved", but understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the Prime and Foreign Ministers to discuss with other countries and the G20 whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
It is an international conference, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
Following the tragic events that followed the Malaysian Airlines accident, as well as the lack of pity, responsibility and proper cooperation in connection with the accident, and now that thousands of Russian soldiers are on the Ukrainian border, I think that most Australians are very reserving Putin's welcome to Australia.
The German business world criticises "self-driving" Berlin
Some of Germany's top executives warn that Germany has become "too confident" and "suspecting", as government policy threatens the competitiveness of the country.
Chancellor Merkel's criticism of the government is happening at the same time as Europe's largest economy is showing signs of slowdown, which causes concern as to whether it will be able to run economic growth in the euro area, which is in its place.
The criticism of directors is the result of the strong opposition of the German business sector to political decisions, including the introduction of minimum wage and the reduction of the retirement age of certain long-term employees to 63 years.
"I think that the greatest threat right now is excessive confidence in Germany, which inevitably causes a sense of self-dependence", says Kurt Bock, CEO of the world's largest chemical manufacturer BASF, based on sales figures.
EU economy
He feels this: 'In general terms, we feel that we are doing well, we have money for use and unemployment at a relatively low level. So what is the problem?'
I think there's a big danger here.
It is clear from the German Government's policy that we are not focused on growth and we are not a favourable environment for businesses, but rather we are focusing much more on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain parties.
According to Markus Kerber, CEO of the BDI of the German Industrial Association, "The situation in Germany is now good.
However, over the next ten years, each developed economy will have to change. ...[in Germany] the reform programme will not make as much progress as it has done in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce DIHK has also expressed criticism for recent political developments.
Germany's unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced, even if consumption has slowed down again.
However, the fall in GDP in the second quarter has highlighted the vulnerability of the exporting-profit Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP fell by 0.2 per cent in the three months preceding June from the previous year.
Germany's weakened performance threatens to make the ECB's fight against low inflation even more difficult and may make quantitative recovery more likely.
Kerber would like the government to "go back from public consumption to public investment", for example by focusing on the additions of future consumption to infrastructure, not so much on pensions.
According to Kerber, the Merkel Government will destroy the fruits produced by his social-democratic predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, in the early 2000s by strict politics.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, CEO of the Stiftung Familienunternehmen Foundation, established for family businesses, "Germany still has a good situation compared to other countries.
It is thanks to companies, not so much government policy. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The example of the neighbouring country, France, has shown that spending money on social assistance and limiting the freedom to manage a business is the wrong way to act.
The leading German investment banker described the situation more frankly, saying that recent government decisions are a "disaster".
Germany is threatening to lose everything it has worked so hard to please the voters.
This is my main concern at the moment," the banker says.
According to Mr Bock, the energy reforms of the new government coalition failed to address the fundamental weaknesses of the policy which have led to the cost of reducing competitiveness for industry.
Ashton Kutcher with the music festival for the handshake, with security guards blocked access to the fan
Actor Ashton Kutcher attended the Stagecoach Music Festival in Indio, California, where he was reported to have had a fight with a strict security guard.
They say Ashton Kutcher got into a fight with a security guard at a country music festival.
Kutcher’s fan tried to approach him at backstage at Stagecoach Music Festival in California, after which the situation was robbed, says the TMZ website.
Kutcher was in the VIP room when a young woman approached him to greet and shake hands with him.
When the star of the Men's Half-Series went to greet the fans, the overzealous security guard stepped in and caused the pussies.
The actor and the security guard got a handshake, and Kutcher's friends had to stop him, says TMZ.
After divorceing his ex-wife, Demi Moore Kutcher is dating Mila Kunis, who, like Kutcher, is the stars of the former 70s show.
The puppet happened shortly after Angus T. Jones had practically removed the hit series from the standard actor map after he published a video in which he calls the series "poor" and urges fans not to watch it.
Actor Ashton Kutcher is attending the Stagecoach Music Festival in California.
Angus T. Jones, "Jake", calls the show "dangerous" and urges people not to watch.
The bacteria in the Baltic Sea killed the holidayer
Six people have been affected by the Caribbean bacteria, which are located in a popular German tourist destination.
One of the sick is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and other parts of the world, but it is found most in the Gulf of Mexico.
The bacteria are most effective in breaking waters of over 20 degrees.
"Bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are right", Dr. Heiko Will, Director of the Office for Health and Safety of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (LAGuS) told The Local.
The bacteria are equally found in Denmark, Poland and along the German coast.
According to LAGuS, the sick had been on holiday in Usedom at the end of July.
He passed away early in August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks, and it is possible that his leg should be amputated.
He went swimming near Ahrenshop with a small wound in his leg.
The sick one went to the hospital on his way home and found that his leg had turned blue.
Doctors found blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnificus in the leg.
"My husband would certainly not have spent time in the Baltic Sea region if he had known of the danger," told Ostsee Zeitung, the ill wife of Sonja Bruehl.
A serious illness and the damage caused by blood poisoning to the patient and his family could have been avoided if more information had been available, for example, the holiday site could have produced a brochure.
LAGuS informed the Dpa news agency that doctors have been advised to have the next infection at the beginning of the summer, but no official announcement was given.
Cool temperatures have led to a lower risk of bacterial disease.
"The test results of [ Monday] show that V. vulnificus has significantly decreased its strain," says Dr. Will.
Cool weather has worked.
Vibrio vulnificus, a family of bacteria that cause cholera, is particularly dangerous in patients with a history of chronic liver disease and a reduced immune response, such as HIV or diabetes patients and elderly people.
Men’s risk of disease is higher than women’s, because estrogen has been observed to protect against a pathogen.
If the bacteria get sick, it'll cause blood poisoning and sepsis.
After the bacteria has been wound, the probability of dying from the disease is about 25%.
V. vulnificus can also be affected by eating the marine gastropods that it has contaminated, although Dr. Will says this is not an infectious disease.
Contamination of marine food is more common in the southern hemisphere.
In Germany, V. vulnificus caused poisoning the last time in 2010, when two people died.
Vieno Kekkonen: Chest removal due to suspected cancer
A singer aged 80 years and over Vino Kekkonen works and works hard, but has also had to fear for his health.
I can't believe Vieno Kekkonen, who's been in the light for 80 years.
He himself is surprised how many years of age can suddenly be found.
I haven't quite realized I'm this old.
For 80 years, that sounds like a lot, but Vino Kekkonen laughs.
Vieno Kekkonen is spending his birthday with his family.
At the end of August, a birthday party was held for him by the National Music and Pensioners' Association in Kartula, where he lived his childhood.
We were on Kekkola's stage, in the same place my grandfather was born.
I was so embarrassed by the party, the birthday hero tells me of an event where the stage, measured at three hundred, was full of congratulations.
A few days later, Muhos was gathered to greet Armi Kuusela, whose life Vino Kekkonen remembers having followed when he was young.
And now we're both this age!
Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
During his long career, there are only a few aspects that have not been seen in public about Vieno Kekkonen.
One thing he has never said in public before: 2006 was rid of his second breast.
There was an unclear finding in my chest at a point where it was decided to remove it completely.
It was not, then, cancer, of course, which I was happy with.
A new breast was performed during the same operation, so it was a rather large procedure.
Vieno Kekkonen has not thought of losing his own breast in a sense of vain, for knowledge of an unclear finding would have been a heavy strain and cannot be ignored.
I was just so relieved when nothing was serious, Vieno Kekkonen tells me and points out that losing one’s own breast is certainly more difficult for younger ones.
Read about Vieno Kekkonen's extensive personal interview in full from the evening-Sanomis.

They're making the farmer guilty of the sea state.
The debate on the weak state of the Baltic Sea and its link with Finnish agriculture is depressing.
The voice of experts has been drowned in politically targeted opinions.
In particular, during the summer, Helsingin Sanomat and Yle have reduced agricultural responsibility for nutrient emissions to the Baltic Sea.
The same breath requires rapid action to control emissions.
The average farmer seems to be a few environmental researchers and, with their help, well-informed suppliers compared to a superior nutrition expert.
The farmer knows that the nutrient spray cannot come from cultivation if the same amount of nutrients have been sown in the field as is the case with the harvest.
In Finland almost all farms are committed to the environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilisers and requires close monitoring and reporting of the nutrient balance.
The authorities shall monitor compliance with the conditions.
The nutrients stored in the field have also been flushed into water bodies after manure restrictions, but there has been a clear reduction in emissions for many years.
Farmers have the will and willingness to continue working to reduce nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should understand that access to zero is impossible.
"If we want to have approximately the same amount of agricultural production as consumption, then we just have to accept that this is the case", says Jyrki Aakkula, Director of Environmental Research at MTT (MT 29.8).
Last summer, the Gulf of Finland was brought with it a large group of bluebirds.
The researchers were quite in agreement that the leprosy gained its growth power from the sea’s own phosphorous stocks.
The phosphorus stored at the bottom of the sea is partly a decoy of the past decades' agriculture in coastal countries, but it alone does not explain the stocks.
The waste water treatment of the growing cities on the shores of the Baltic Sea was at a retreat until the end of the 20th century.
The problem also concerned large-scale waste water in Helsinki and was not seen as a problem as regards pollution on its own shores.
Coastal pollution was prevented by building a waste water pipe on the open sea in the 1980s.
Of course, over the years, the quality of water has improved.
The nutrients that once ended up in the sea will not leave there, even if agriculture is completely cut off from Finland.
Yet every summer's debate and accusations are always on agriculture today.
The public debate marks the farmer as guilty of the state of the Baltic Sea.
The charge is disproportionate, but it becomes increasingly difficult when used to implement political passions.
Under the leadership of its President, Mr Niinistö, the Minister for the Environment, the Greens, will make major changes to the environmental standards of agriculture.
As a platform, Niinistö has used the summer’s discussion.
In other words, the Niistö has accused the producers' interest organisation of being old-fashioned and considered it to be the most difficult obstacle to the protection of water.
There should also be some sort of political rhetoric.
Most of the specific projects for water protection are based specifically on cooperation between the RTD, farmers and environmental management.
The attacking style of the Nile serves more the fishing of city-green sounds than water protection.
I guess that's the point.
With tough speeches, the Greens are preparing to leave the government.
In policy changes, it is the responsibility of the MTK to ensure the livelihood of its members.
It is difficult to trade changes that are expensive to farmers unless there is a substitute for their costs.
The only money that Ville Niinistö has presented is cuts from other agricultural funds.
Reversal of mining tax does not go through: Palmer
The latest attempt by Abbott's government to throw a mine tax in the trash can seem doomed, for Clive Palmer has declared that his senators will reject it without any change.
The Australian Labour Party is also afraid that the government has included in the new initiative a rule to limit employers' additions to compulsory pension contributions up to 2034.
The Government took advantage of a qualified majority in Parliament's lower room on Monday to speed up the process of abrogation in the face of general confusion and the clear resentment of the Labour Party.
It put aside the original repeal initiative, to which the Senate had made significant changes in the past, and replaced it with a new bill, which it described above all related to taxes, pension contributions, social security and family social assistance.
Originally, this was an initiative aimed at abolishing the 'deficient' mining tax and other decisions, such as the low-income pension (savings of $3.6 billion), the bonus on earnings ($1.3 billion) and the bonus on school-age children ($4.7 billion).
The president of the Palmer United Party (PUP) Clive Palmer did not accept the transfer of the government.
"The well-designed mine tax repeal initiative will not be adopted in the Senate without a low-income pension fee, a bonus on earnings and a bonus on school-age children," he tweeted.
The Government needs support from independent parties such as the PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
The shadow finance minister, Chris Bowen, accused the government of trying to remove Parliament's power to decide on the mandatory amount of pension contributions, giving the Minister of Finance all the power of decision.
"This is unprecedented," he said to journalists in Canberra.
This would allow the government to delay other additions so that the target of 12% of the working party's pension contributions would be passed up to 2034.
"It is not acceptable in any way, and the Labour Party will, of course, be opposed by all means," Bowen says.
The amount of the guarantee is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the Minister of Finance the power to decide to stop future additions.
The man's body was found on the beach of Brighton.
Sussex police picked up an unidentified man's body before the tide of 2 o'clock, and the police shut down an area near the beginning of the Volk's Electric Railway tourist attraction.
The police and the coroner are working to find out under which conditions the body was placed on the beach.
He hasn't been identified yet.
The investigators will go through the list of missing persons to see if the missing persons have contact with the body.
The police have not yet been able to confirm whether death occurred in suspicious circumstances.
According to the Mexican police, one death victim was killed in an accidental explosion at the border.
According to the police of Piedras Negras, the accidental explosion in the customs building at the border between Mexico and the United States caused the death of one woman and the injury of five others.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas is the operational director of the local police of the city on the Texas border.
He told Associated Press that the woman who died in the Sunday explosion was brain damage and five others were burned.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion took place this morning at the customs offices of the night.
The cause of the explosion is currently being investigated, but the authorities believe that the explosion occurred from the accumulation of gases.
The explosion did not affect border guard.
Three Atlantic City casinos closing in September
Three Atlantic City casinos closing their doors this month
The male client plays at the showboat casino, which is supposed to close its doors, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
September is expected to be a difficult month for Atlantic City when three casinos hand out their last cards on the table
Three casinos are closing their doors this month in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which means that this neo-lighted metropolis known as the sloth can no longer count on gambling revenue.
More than 5,000 workers are unemployed at the closure of Showboat and Revel casinos this weekend, the Associated Press News Office reported.
There'll be more unemployed when Trump Plaza turns off his light.
Three casinos, one of which had only been able to operate for two years, are expected to be the latest disaster in the city after the end of the story of the Atlantic Club centre only eight months earlier.
By the end of September, over 25% of the city’s casino workers, 8 000 people, will be unemployed, New York Times writes.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a firm choice for the bad economy Atlantic City, the AP news office writes.
However, the local gambling industry has received many more competitors when New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania casinos block a large part of Atlantic City once such a huge casino effort.
Even before, Massachusetts, who opposed gambling, looks at his own share of the money by welcoming three casinos to the state.
TVO: The new timetable for Areva is difficult to accept
According to the Industrial Power (TVO), it is difficult for it to accept a new assessment by the plant supplier Areva that Olkiluoto's third reactor is only available for commercial use in 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoinen, the director of the power plant project, this is due, among other things, to the fact that the construction works are already largely completed and the number of works in progress is known.
The TVO will continue to evaluate the information received from Areva.
Mr Silvennoinen noted in the Communication that TVO welcomed all initiatives to speed up the project.
Areva today provided TVO with an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3, according to which the third reactor construction works will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial operations could start in 2018.
According to Areva’s press release, recent delays in the project were mainly due to the approval of reactor automation systems received in April.
This was preceded by four years of negotiations with TVO.
Olkiluoto 3 was supposed to be completed as early as 2009, but the schedule has been postponed one after another.
TVO and Areva have been arguing for years about who is responsible for the delay.
Objections the wood in an arbitration court, where Areva has charged TVO as much as EUR 2.7 billion.
TVO, on the other hand, considers Areva's claims to be unfounded and requires some EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation between energy and water actors is needed in the face of global challenges
Today, international leaders met in Stockholm within the framework of the 24th International Water Week, and they called on energy and water actors to work together to meet the greatest challenges of our time to ensure sufficient water and energy production to the increasing population.
The theme of the 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often interdependent.
Energy is needed for water pumping, storage, transport and cleaning, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, the other will be affected immediately.
These two funds are also an integral part of sustainable development and should always be borne in mind when making global decisions.
Torgny Holmgren, CEO of the Stockholm International Water Institute, organised the water week, said in the opening of the water week that "the challenges are huge".
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore closer cooperation between energy and water actors is urgently needed in order to find solutions that enable all nations in the world to flourish.
This year's Water Week Prize winner, Professor John Briscoe, described water as an enabling basis for growth, needed by society as a whole as well as by other sectors. Briscoe said that "the developing countries face major challenges.
They must mobilise these funds.
Mr Briscoe added that "there is no permanent solution to the [water crisis] anywhere".
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form a circle.
During the week, representatives will discuss ongoing and future work and cooperation between energy and water actors during more than 100 seminars, workshops and events.

Flying dead foreign bodies home in Miami: Costs of flying dead bodies
In October 2012, a ferry carrying 23 Cuban refugees to Miami crashed and 14 people were reported dead.
The same has happened to hundreds of years earlier, and this certainly was not the last of its kind.
Every year, over 1,000 U.S. immigrants die illegally trying to cross the U.S. border.
Because of the first city, they're ready to die.
However, it is ironic that upon reaching the first city in the country, few plan to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place of residence: either asylum, an effort platform upwards or a place of entertainment while waiting for a better opportunity.
Few people think they're dying there, and as death approaches, many people plan to return to their homeland.
A disproportionate number of foreign-born and temporary residents live in popular cities, where death and return to their home country continue to work.
An estimated 20% of the dead in South Florida are being transported elsewhere, more than anywhere else in the United States.
The majority of human remains (HR, short form of professional slang words human remains) are transported to their home country from Miami International Airport.
Since 1964, Pierson, the largest company in the sector, has said that about 80% of this traffic travels abroad. The company is flying bodies to several destinations in Central and South America and to several European countries.

The more immigrants move to popular cities, the more they die there.
Even after death, a return home has its expense.
Miami is the main airport of American Airlines for flights to Latin America, and the figures in the table describe the human remains returned to its home country in 2013.
The return of bodies to their home country is not cheap: prices can vary from five to thousands of dollars.
The religious, cultural and public health requirements for the operation and delivery of human remains also vary.
Immigrant communities in cities that are popular with migrants sometimes organise funeral communities to help with the costs, because the return of bodies is expensive, the government does not help in the process and the dead are often young people who do not have insurance.
Some credit institutions and informal health insurance schemes were once born from such communities, founded by Italian, Jewish, and Greek Italians living in New York, the first immigrant groups in the United States.
The new generations of Mexicans, Chineses, Filipinos, and Bangladeshese immigrants now work in many of their favorite cities.

Death abroad always causes difficulties, as few people who have moved abroad plan to make the immigrant city their last resting place.
For example, in Dubai, for those who died without a will, the Sharia Act is adhered to, even if the law on the collection of the deceased’s home country is different.
The entire assets of the deceased shall be frozen and subsequently distributed in accordance with the decision of the Sharia Court.
Aer Lingus, which is the headquarters of Dublin, has a network for the transport of human remains (
2013) the extent reflects the multi-cultural demographic structure of the city and the Irish.
The airline interrupted the service but resumed it in 2004 after having received negative feedback from migrants.
The idea of death is rarely present when a person passes through a popular city of immigrants or when he lives there.
On the contrary – temporary or permanent migration to the immigrant city is an open declaration of the immigrant’s way of looking at life, not death.
However, death in a migrant city abroad means making the most powerful and irreversible decisions for a migrant – decisions on whether or not to belong to a local or global community, to a universe or to a country, to a short-term or to an eternity.
The Centre and the Left Union will issue an interim issue on inequalities.
The opposition parties in the centre and the Left Union are going to issue the government with an interim question on the income of people with low incomes and the growth of inequality.
The parties want to stimulate the debate on people's income problems, which are exacerbated by poor economic development and increasing unemployment.
There is also a growing disparity between the different parts of the country and within large cities, the parties point out in their press release.
In the government's budget next year, cuts and tax increases, according to parties, are targeted at low incomes such as students, the unemployed and pensioners, family and ordinary workers, while, among other things, food, medicines and housing are still higher.
In fact, almost half a million people are already unemployed, the parties say in their communications.
The problem of living in work has also become worse.
The Parliamentary Groups of the Centre and the Left Union will discuss the matter on Thursday.
The third opposition party, the fundamental Finns, have already announced that they will submit an interim question on the resources of the police and internal security.
The Parliamentary autumn session begins tomorrow Tuesday.
The West Indian Day parade in New York City is about to begin.
The Caribbean culture is back in the light of New York City, where the West Indian Day parade is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, where politicians see each other and become visible.
The annual parade will be held on Monday in Brooklyn.
It gives rise to traditional carnival celebrations, some of which are dancers who wear complex, often feather - made costumes.
Eric Adams, president of the Brooklyn region, is the festival champion of this year, but many other political faces are also expected.
The parade is a great opportunity for current and candidate politicians to welcome the public a week before the pre-elections.
Despite the celebrations, violence has also taken place in previous years.
The police have said that they are trying to keep the event safe by means of additional measures, including monitoring the activities of gangs in the vicinity.
Is it worth even asking rhetorical questions?
Everyone knows rhetorical questions, right?
You don't want to answer that question.
This illustration, that is, a question that is not expected to be answered, but which suggests a certain answer, is a taste of both high-flying words and a more daily exchange of words.
The proclamation of Cicero's famous Catilina is a chain of rhetorical questions, the first of which is, "How long, O Catilina, are you going to take advantage of our patience?"
The same applies to the questions my wife put to me: "Why shouldn't I warm up five days old chicken?"
Why are you so tense?
The difference is a better word for a rhetorical question.
The force of the rhetorical question lies in the fact that the question is open and the public is persuaded to accept it.
The secretly rhetorical question suggests that no one sane could agree on that.
The 18th century writer David Williams described a rhetorical question as "some of the words that have been shown to someone who is admirably designed to give a strong feeling of the truth about something about the subject, and at the same time the challenge that they pose is impossible to disagree".
Skilling Skill
If you want to achieve more ambitious goals, you can ask rhetorical questions.
Several retrospect questions designed to express grief or resentment are called epiplexy.
For example, Job uses them to appeal to the Almighty: "What do you do for being oppressed --?"
Do you have eyes like ours?
Do you see it the same way a person sees it?
The chains of rhetoric are also found in my wife's comments: "Why did you cause food poisoning to the children?
Are you out of your mind?
Can't you do anything right?
In addition, there is a so-called hypophora, which is the case when the question is asked and answered immediately.
Isaac Hayes provides an excellent example of this: "Who is the black private egg that is a sexual fear for all women?
Parru!
That's right!
Who would sacrifice his life for his brother?
More examples from my wife: "What is the only food that children have eaten, and where have they become sick?"
This chicken.
What idiot fed it to them?
You.
Strangely enough, the rhetorical question does not tend to bend, although rhetoric means the skill of persuasion.
If you try to talk to someone around instead of trying to preach to those who are already converted, or get angry with someone’s stubbornness, you should use rhetorical questions in a sustainable way.
They are more useful in trying to reconcile opinions than in trying to get one to accept his own opinion.
If the public agrees with the argument "It's not nice when it's so sunny out there?" the rhetorical question tells us that the speaker is sure of his claim, which binds the speaker and the public better together.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is sure that there are no differences of opinion.
Assuming that a consensus has been reached rather than reaching a consensus, the speaker may seem, well, self-righteous.
In other situations, the rhetorical question refers to the weak point of the argument.
In the headlines of the magazines, the rhetorical question is too often the strongest possible argument in a very weak case: "Did the aliens build pyramids?"
In both cases, there is a risk that the question may lead to an answer which is different from that referred to.
"Do you think the same thing as we do?" was part of the British Conservative Party's risky campaign statement in general elections in 2005.
The party's gone.
For some, finding such cases has become a hobby, and the so-called Qtwain questions (the concept made known by the British journalist John Rentoul) Questions To Which Answer Is No, questions that are not answered are popular.
A few years ago, a friend of mine organised a competition that looked for the best examples.
The competition was clearly won by the song "Do You Wanna Be In My Gang?", which was sang by pop star Gary Glitter before he became a child's sexual abuser.
The writer has also written the book "You Talkin' to Me"?
Researcher: The time of the Federal Compromise may be over
At the beginning of the conflict, many countries still thought that the federal state could be some kind of compromise on the conflict, says Saari.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin said earlier in an interview with the Russian channel that getting peace to Eastern Ukraine calls for discussions on the state status of the region.
In practice, this would mean some form of self-government in eastern Ukraine.
According to Putin, it would protect the legitimate rights of those living in the East.
According to the island, the transformation of Ukraine into a federal state is a certain priority for Russia's aims.
I am sure that Ukraine will have reason to doubt that Russia will thereby try to influence Ukraine's internal policy, he says.
If there is no federal solution, the second alternative could be some kind of frozen conflict from Russia's point of view, where Russia would in practice control Luhansk and Donetsk, Saari estimates.
West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending weapons and soldiers to the east.
Russia has denied the arguments, even though, for example, the Russian-minded rebels themselves have told us that there have been a fight among their troops against "residence, voluntary Russian soldiers".
Upi Director: Powerful Mission for Catalyst
The brickman reminds us that the mission is new and is yet to be outlined.
In his view, the idea is that Katainen should somehow coordinate or even lead the Commission's work on competitiveness and employment.
Of course, one of the priorities of the Commission's new-period programme is the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That is how we are at the heart of the Commission's power, says the Tiilikainen.
The brick player believes that Katainen's background, economic know-how and role during the economic crisis give him the opportunity to play a good role within the Commission.
According to the plans, the task would be portfolioless, i.e. Katai would not have its own Directorate-General under his responsibility.
On the other hand, Kataina would be a team leader in the EU's competitiveness and employment field, and would be able to have other portfolios in the field in addition to the Economic Commissioner's portfolio to be coordinated.
In practice, leadership of the team could mean, for example, planning and guidance.
Mothers of soldiers: up to 15,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Military Mothers’ Association, up to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine in the last two months, and over 7,000 Russian soldiers are currently in the country.
According to human rights organisations, at least 200 Russian soldiers are dead.
According to the organisation, the hospital in Rostov, a city near the Ukrainian border, is full of wounded in the Ukrainian war.
The mothers of soldiers gather their knowledge from soldiers' families.
NATO has estimated that there are over a thousand Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
BB-Andte for his drinking: "After a little drink, there's gonna be a story."
Big brother Jussi and Andte drifted into thinking about the life of the BB House on Monday night.
Jussi, on the side of the basement, was riding a fitness bike with Ande, who lived in the Manor on Monday night.
Two people wondered what their actions seemed like to the viewers of the program.
Not until you've seen it, Andte said.
In Jussi's view, most of the time in the BB house is waiting and spending.
Possible parties or assignments form only a fraction of the life of the BB House.
More than that, we wait and wonder and talk and live.
Ande, Anne and Jussi.
On Wednesday, the people of the Manor spent the evening on wet signs, and alcohol in particular hit Ande’s phone.
Jussi asked Andtel if the party had made a man’s life more meaningful now that he had been able to talk to other residents in a little hipraca.
I'll have a little drink, and then we'll have a case, and Andte'll admit it.
Watch the Andte interview on the ISTV video!
Let Abreu reveal his body will in Me Women
Anna Abreu says in Me Women magazine that she decided to lose weight two years ago when she was on a break.
Anna, who was tired of doing the job at the time, thought with her weight loss she would get more energy.
Fred Montana / Splash News
Give me a dream a couple of years ago about a body like Victoria's Secret.
My body design was like Victoria's Secret.
I wanted to look good, and I thought I wanted to lose weight, so Anna tells the paper.
Anna, who presents her body with concerts and music videos, says that she is not a lust trainer, even though she has been named that way.
Viena Kytöjoki
Anna, who's in Timmi's condition, is in the gym, and she's in the boxing business.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but the fact that I have a certain amount of weight raised in the gym, Anna points out.
Sometimes a pop star gives himself permission to taste.
If I taste it, I really do.
Sometimes I'm going to have unwell friends, and I don't think I'm going to have to spend more pounds.
Instead, I wonder what my body thinks.
I hate it when I do something bad to my body.
Load Supreme
Anna says she's comfortable in her body.
The distribution of profits by companies pleases shareholders but does not increase growth
Did the directors of Australian listed companies today just try to please the large crowd by agreeing to the shareholder’s wishes for a greater distribution of profits and by buying back their shares?
Is the decision-making power moving from corporate governments to shareholders served by the government?
The most important distribution of profits was revealed last week at the end of the reporting period 2014.
The prices of shares in companies that have rewarded investors in the form of buy-back programmes and by sharing more profits have risen clearly.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
However, the reverse side of the coin is that capital consumption is falling faster than the analysts have predicted, which makes many ask whether the emphasis on short-term popularity is too high and whether sufficient focus is placed on the growth of the immediate future and the long-term.
Of course, some companies return money to shareholders and finance business by other means.
More funding is being obtained from, for example, cheap stock markets.
From the point of view of the company, this makes sense because the loan is currently cheap, while the capital is not.
However, even if the funds acquired on the loan market were not taken into account, it is clear that a generous approach to shareholders is financed, above all, by the use of less money to invest in the company.
The net result of this wave (and cancellation of profit investment plans) of the purchase programmes is the decrease in capital on the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls this reporting period "for the period of the decline in capital", during which companies have tried to keep the number of shares to a minimum.
As part of the same plan, companies have fewer and fewer capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the repurchase programmes was EUR 3.7 billion, and the value of the expected unrealised capital acquisition programmes was EUR 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far as to see the consumption of capital as a curse word in one of the titles of its report.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, there has been informal evidence for months.
Glenn Stevens, Director of the Central Bank of Australia, considered it sufficient to point out a few weeks ago that companies needed a little more "combating spirit" to increase investment.
Stevens is not worried about the future of individual companies, but about the overall impact on the economy, as the slow capital consumption generally leads to negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
It is said from Credit Suisse that "the own estimates of the consumption of their capital by reporting companies have, on average, decreased by four per cent over the previous two years.
The estimates of the free cash flow have increased by an average of 2%.
Improving cash flow is likely to increase the consumption of capital.
This quick look is good from the point of view of the current shareholders and the stock market, but it is also some kind of proof of corporate obedience.
If I could get a coin every time the CEO said that the price of a short-term share is not important, I would... well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
Of course, this argument is not true.
The CEOs monitor very closely the prices of shares and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
The short and long-term bonus packages of CEOs are determined by the value of the shares, and the position of directors depends on them.
The CEOs would like to say that some decisions (whether they were business transactions, increased investment in the organisation or distribution of profits) are not always immediately popular, but they are useful for the medium-term strategy.
In fact, business managers often complain about the fact that there is a very short-sighted approach to investment markets.
Therefore, the current need for conservativeness seems to be acceptable to the short-term objectives.
However, during the reporting period that has just ended, it was too clear that the weight was in reducing the consumption of capital for the future, and that the most economical companies were praised.
Large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, held the number one in reducing capital consumption, but also many other companies are doing the same – some of the necessity and some because they were afraid of the reaction of shareholders.
Why, then, do investors put pressure on companies to share profits?
According to the strategicist Hasa Tevfik, it is clear that shareholders want more income, as the profits of other, more traditional fixed-rate investment products have decreased as the global interest rates have suddenly been lowered by the central banks in order to bring more money to the market.
In this way, investors have been forced into the capital market to look for profits and in turn they are putting pressure on companies to share more profits.
Shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies whose profit distribution is uncertain.
Investors would prefer the money at once as more investors approach the retirement age.
The statistics for the previous reporting period clearly show that the distribution of profit was largely influenced by the company's cost cuts and not by the increase in turnover.
In case of leaking of public nudity photos, it looks like a data search or a hack into an email account.
Jennifer Lawrence's pictures and some sources say that an unknown hacker leaking videos online amazes information security experts and Apple.
Although a hacker has published lists of women in a chat room and said that he has more pictures of women, some of them have reported that their images are fake while others have said that they were long ago deleted.
There are many of them, and they are said to include Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and American actor Mary E Winstead.
After hacking, the biggest question is what was the attack done through.
And were the pictures and videos genuine, and where were they downloaded from?
The most recent source of news for images – a shameless and thorough attack on Apple's iCloud service – is the most unlikely option.
Big companies such as Apple have invested in security teams working inside the house, which are responsible for trying to penetrate the company's own systems regularly.
"A large scale hacking into Apple's iCloud service is unlikely.
Nor does the original publisher claim that the claim should be correct," notes Rik Ferguson, Vice-President of the Information Security Research Unit of Trend Micro.
A simpler and more likely explanation for those hackers associated with the public (and less famous hackers every day) is the leaking of an email address and password, either by guessing or by fishing information, i.e. by tricking a person to log in to a genuine-looking site and then using this information against them.
Apple continues to investigate the alleged attack on the iCloud service used on iPhone phones to store settings and, above all, to copy images when transferred to the cloud server.
The user's account can be logged into the iCloud service by providing this email address and password, and then their images and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account holder has introduced a two-stage authentication ("two factor authentication"), i.e. an additional protection against intruding into the account, thereby sending a code to the owner's mobile phone before entering the account.
However, it is relatively rare to use 2FA, either because it is not known or because it is considered laborious.
Apple will continue to examine whether all the information is derived from its iCloud service and, if so, how far users' accounts were intruded.
The company has not delivered an opinion on this matter at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson believes it is possible that the hacker has used the "Forgotten Password" link in Apple's iCloud service by first collecting the e-mail addresses of the public persons, for example, from the address book of the second hacked device.
It is also possible that celebrities have used the same password in several services, when passwords were hijacked through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's photos claims that the pictures are authentic, but does not tell when they are taken.
Winstead said in his tweet that it could be a long-term hacking attempt.
These images were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this took a terrible effort.
I feel sorry for everyone else who was hacked," he wrote in his tweet.
However, independent information security expert Graham Cluley points out that Winstead may have thought that he had removed the images from his mobile phone, but removing the image from today’s smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the picture.
Modern smartphones regularly record images in the cloud service because there is often no room for a large number of images taken by the user.
Apple’s iPhone standard setting is to store images in iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft Windows phones to store images in OneDrive.
Independent service providers, such as Dropbox, provide automatic image and data storage services.
"People take and remove pictures, but they don't understand that the photos are being downloaded from the account," Cluley says to The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: "The deleted does not always mean deleted," he states.
Pictures and videos can be stored for years.
If someone has access to the user's email address and password, they can reload all the images and videos that have been sent by email.
Pictures of Apple's service can be downloaded to Mac, Windows PC or any of Apple's devices.
The hacker published a screenshot that was claimed to display videos and images taken from Windows PC, not yet published.
Two-stage identification protects against such hacking, as it requires anyone who tries to copy an existing account to another device to provide the original user with a code, usually sent to the mobile phone.
Without the code, access to the account will be denied.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo offer a two-stage identification to the account, but it is not yet known whether these public authorities used the service or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the images they claim to be are not genuine.
The representative of Ariana Grande has said that the images that they claim to be in the Grand are "fully faked".
Victoria Justice wrote in her tweet: "The naked pictures taken of me are DETERMINED, don't you understand.
Let me cut off the rumors right away.
Cluley's bringing up another option.
Since the hackers were public persons, someone who handled their social media accounts or regularly managed their e-mails could break into their accounts.
"I'd like to know if the actors' agencies or some representative have a part to play in this," he wonders.
However, those persons of the public concerned do not use one publisher or agency.
The other option is that someone who installed or helped with the configuration of one or more systems of the victim's security attack and secretly changed the system so that all information can be returned.
This was the case in the case of Christopher Chaney, a florist with the nickname "Hollywood Hacker", where the hacker distributed images from Scarlett Johansson's and Mila Kunis's e-mail accounts in 2011 and was sentenced to ten years in prison in December 2012. He was also ordered to pay over $66,000 in damages.
Chaney was secretly accused of invading the e-mail accounts of more than 50 persons in the entertainment industry between November 2010 and October 2011. In one case, he asked Aguilera for pictures of the star in the name of this stylist, and then published the pictures online.
Chaney later apologized, saying that his actions were, I'm sure, one of the worst violations of privacy that you can imagine.
Chaney was also claimed to spy on two people online for more than ten years.
Cluley said, "In the case of Chaney, the e-mail accounts of the stars were hacked, and they were changed so that someone sent their data to us even after the password was changed."
Cluley says that the obsessive action of hackers breaking into these accounts is "like the collection of butterflies."
They just want to collect this kind of information.
In this case, it is possible that someone had come across a list of data and login information on these accounts in services such as Dropbox.
Hackers may also have tried to intrude for a long time.
or they had access to information on an e-mail account, such as the address book, and then they fished for information from other persons.
I don't think it's a simple iCloud security breach.
Australia has offered its intelligence service to help the UN track down 44 peacekeepers kidnapped by Al-Qaeda-related terrorists in Syria.
The terrorist group, Jabhat al-Nusra, is believed to have held 44 Fijian peacekeepers imprisoned, who conquered the crossing point on the Golan hills last week and forced the UN forces to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since Wednesday, and there is no information on their whereabouts.
At the same time, ministers from the United Nations Conference of Small Developing Island States, including Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are very concerned about what has happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Mon at the summit, and he has offered Australian assistance in order to rescue the missing peacekeepers.
"I am convinced that Australia will help the UN in everything that it can, including providing intelligence assistance," she said to the AAP news service from Samoa on Monday.
We are very close to all of the intelligence networks' co-operations and friends -- to ensure that we can locate them and that they are safe.
Bishop has already assured Fijin Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola that Australia will use its position in the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, the Philippines peacekeeping group held captive in their military forces was reported to have escaped in different parts of the same controversial area.
The UN has been monitoring the Golan hills since the 1974 ceasefire in Syria and Israel.
The cheaters are trying to steal your money through a carbon tax evasion initiative, warning the Australian Competition Authority ACCC
Cheaters are using the carbon tax repeal initiative to steal money, ACCC warns.
The Competition Authority’s SCAMwatch unit has warned consumers and businesses not to rely on too good offers from government agencies offering thousands of dollars’ worth of credit.
The fraudsters may use the figures they see in the media to prove to the consumer how much he can save on buying goods after the carbon tax has been abolished and, offering it up to $7,000, the warning says.
Cheaters may sound very convincing because they have cleared the victim’s personal data that they use to try to access bank information or to try to get the victim to pay a reward.
They're discussing topical topics to trick the victim.
Cheaters use other than carbon tax fraud to get their hands on the money, their stories are more advanced, and they take advantage of current things to build a scam around them.
The missing aircraft of MH370 and the death of Robin Williams have also inspired the cheaters.
The ACCC will instruct you to contact the company using the contact details explained itself, instead of the contact details provided by the caller, if there is any doubt as to the identity of the caller representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected call or email from someone who claims to represent the government agency or company, such as the energy company, and that you are entitled to compensation for the abolition of the carbon tax, beware.
If you believe that you have been deceived and have provided personal information or transferred money to a fraud account, contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true – for example, free money shared by the government – it is likely to be so.
Economic words: Lipponen denies EU sanctions against Russia
Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen criticises the sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia in the interview with the economic messages.
Russia's priority in politics is to pursue its own interests.
This may not be effective," Lipponen says in the interview.
Lipponen has started working as a business director for the EC Arctic regions of the Central Business Union.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) suspended their project funding from Russia as part of the EU's financial sanctions.
"This means, for example, that environmental projects of the Northern Dimension, with clear prospects, will go on ice," Lipponen says in the interview.
The freezing of funding is now detrimental to cooperation, which Lipposen says can be difficult to rebuild if there is no trust.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in cooperation projects in the Arctic region will continue as much as it has done in the past.
He is currently reporting to the EC on Finland's Arctic policy and business opportunities in the north.
It is not affected by the acute situation in Ukraine or by the situation in Russia.
The report looks far ahead, talks about tens of years," he says.
It is rare for the Norway to come to a low-water or near a settlement, says the natural teacher Vesa Heinonen from the Ostrobothnia Museum.
In the summer bay of Vaasa, a nostril was seen swimming near the beach this Sunday.
According to Heinosen, the Norway has probably come to Suvilahti after food.
It's not a mess.
This means there's fish in the area, Heinonen's tip.
According to him, for example, on the Sundom Bridge we see Norwegians, especially in spring and autumn, who arrive right after fish.
However, Norway is not a common species in the Sea of Vaasa.
On the land, we see the Norwegians at the villas' offices, and he goes on.
Norpes live, among other things, in the North Sea and the Archipelago Sea.
According to the South Australian court, the murdered pizza owner Robert Vallelonga behaved aggressively and violently outside the nightclub.
Murdered South Australian pizza owner Robert Vallelona.
The court hearing has revealed that the pizza owner Robert Vallelonga behaved aggressively against both his partner and the security guard only minutes before he was killed outside the nightclub.
The lawyers charged with the murder of Vallelonga asked for their client to be released from bail in the Lower Court of Adelaide because it was "clearly" self-defence.
Marie Shaw, QC, said that the case was not serious enough to keep her client, whose identity has not been published, locked up until the trial.
"The evidence shows that the dead behaved so aggressively that they had to take him out of the nightclub," he said.
After that, the beak began, which led to the 40-year-old drunk man in question... ripping off a security guard's shirt.
It is important to note that according to the prosecutor, death was caused by one stroke, which clearly refers to self-defence or defence of another.
For now, a 25-year-old man is only accused of murder.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious near Rundle St and the synagogue Place at about 2:25 p.m. on 4 May, with severe head injuries.
He died in his injuries at the Royal hospital in Adelaide early the next day, and his friends and pizzeria clients were left to mourn the "local legend" of One Tree Hill.
According to the prosecutors, there was no cause for the murder of the accused, and after the incident, he had told the cab driver that he had someone sleep for a few days.
But now there's something else in the security video, Shaw says.
"It confirms that the dead behaved aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and got a part of the hard and violent behavior himself," he says.
Our client has both the assumption of innocence and the evidence that he was defending himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
The prosecutors opposed the release of the man because only one of the three security guards who were in the crash had intervened in Vallelonga's conduct.
They said that other security guards didn't think he was a threat because he was "short" and he used a large man's vocabulary because he wanted to avoid physical confrontation.
They said that the taxi driver who saw the case clearly would also prove that Vallelonga was hit "hardly" and that he had no chance to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered the man to be arrested until the next week when he would declare his decision.

It was expected that bad weather would delay the beginning of a widespread forest hunt in the world.
In the Japanese city of Taiji, the annual dolphin hunting season started again on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
The British magazine Guardian, among other things, reports a great deal of opposition to hunting that has taken place around the world.
In the yacht, hunters drive hundreds of dolphins into a remote bay, where mammals are slaughtered after the selection of the most suitable individuals to be transported to dolphinries and theme parks around the world.
The dolphin meat also ends up as food.
However, according to local authorities, the start of the hunt was expected to be delayed due to poor weather.
Information on the practice spread to the world through a documentary film entitled The Cove in 2009.
During the previous hunting seasons, not only farmers but also diplomats have criticised hunting.
According to the opponents, dolphin meat in any case has a limited market due to its high mercury content.
According to those who defend hunting, including the Japanese Government, this is a tradition.
The defenders have also reminded us that dolphins are not a threat.
As early as the weekend, dolphin hunts were resisted in several countries by demonstrations.
In Tokyo, protests show that hunting harms Japan’s reputation in the world.
A demonstration was also held in Helsinki on Monday in front of the Japanese Embassy.
Some of NATO's Member States are uncertain about the deployment of new troops in Eastern Europe
Within NATO, the military alliance shares views as to whether NATO bases should be established in Eastern Europe and the Baltics in response to the crisis in Ukraine, reports the Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have requested a military alliance to bring in permanent troops, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has opposed the plan.
"Ukraine has given a new perspective to Russian politics and threatens to overthrow European security," told Michael Clarke Financial Times, director of the Royal United Services Institute in London.
The NATO Member States are meeting together in the beginning of the week, and the military alliance is due to publish its new preparedness plan.
The key question of the plan is whether NATO can break the TAE Agreement on conventional weapons signed in 1990.
That's where the NATO and the Warsaw Alliance agree on how they're going to place armed forces in the Atlantic and Ural Mountains.
In practice, according to the Financial Times, the agreement prevents new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltic States.
Russia itself frozen its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not actually withdraw from the agreement.
In view of the tightening situation in Ukraine, NATO wonders whether the terms of the agreement still need to be complied with.
"Nato's resources must be in all the NATO countries that need resources," said Sir Malcolm Rifkind, Chairman of the British Parliament's Security Committee, Financial Times.
Matt Guthmiller the youngest flying around the world
When other teenagers learned how to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned how to fly.
The 19-year-old Guthmiller became the youngest flying around the world – and yet alone, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
A young person living in South Dakota flew 30,000 miles, stopping 23 times in 15 different countries in five different continents.
On his way, Guthmiller was treated like a rock star because of his record flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
"Too risky" and "some spoiled, rich kid just wants to see a little world and have fun."
Guthmiller had little to say to those who made such comments.
Of course, I enjoyed a lot of fun, but it also involved a lot of work, and I hope that, with my record, I also encourage other people to go to the world and do great things.
Guthmiller's aviation excitement started when he was young, but first he asked his parents to eat at the airport cafes.
Later, he insisted on getting to flight classes.
My parents let me take a short 20-dollar tour of a 20-minute flight, but I think they thought at the time that I'd stop getting excited about it.
It didn't stop.
Soon after that, Guthmiller concluded an agreement with his parents to give him more time in the cab.
I agreed to share a car with my father all the time in high school instead of having my own car.
At the exchange, I'd be allowed to fly planes.
By the age of 17, Guthmiller had received a flight licence, and two years later he leased a single Beechcraft flight around the world.
A young man who studied at MIT University personally maintained the aircraft and made fuel calculations.
For several hours above, he also meant that he needed an additional refuelling —
In practice, a lot of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller says he ate a couple of cookie boxes in a long flight.
Flying into the clouds was both wonderful and scary.
Air traffic controllers in other countries did not have the means to help them navigate around the storms.
I had no idea which of the clouds were just a little above the plane and which of them reached 45,000 feet and tore the plane apart.
Guthmiller's plane was not pressurized and had no oxygen reserve, so he couldn't fly above the clouds.
The amount of fuel in the machine would never have reached a higher level.
The day after the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died on a flight between the United States of America and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls the hardest part of his journey.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he felt that the take-off phase was technically challenging due to the large amount of fuel needed for the 16-hour flight.
However, despite the risks and even the high-level horror, Guthmiller managed to break the record and raise money for IT training through the Code.org website.
He's a coder himself, and he started his own business at the age of 12.
Guthmiller's goals are in the sky.
I'd love to start the next Apple, but let's see what happens now.
In any case, Guthmiller plans to target high.
Aim for the sky and you can achieve something great.
Finding the right franchise entrepreneur is harder than you think.
Lori Joyce was excited when the fans lined up her Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores around Canada, after the Canadian W-TV channel started showing The Cupcake Girls the truth TV program in 2009.
The excitement continued until it became clear that one franchise entrepreneur was not suitable for the task.
"My French entrepreneur sat in his car and called me and said that a hundred potential customers are waiting outside the store to buy a cup cake, and he can't stand it," Joyce says.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge lost opportunity for us.
After the event, Joyce decided to change the selection process of the franchise partners from the point of view of stressing the company's cultural management skills instead of the bakery skills.
"Whoever can shine in an interview -- they know what I want to hear," he says, adding that he has conducted about a hundred interviews for each of the 11 franchise movements.
We start with six weeks of training, but the workers operate in a completely different way in the working environment themselves, so the whole process is quite difficult, which is why education for us is a priority in terms of suitability for business culture.
Finding the right franchise entrepreneur is vital for the development of any small company.
A strong and honest leader is able to shape and grow an organization, while a bad leader can cause costly damage to the company.
"I used to think that looking for a franchise entrepreneur would be like going out on a date, but it's not true at all, but you can do a lot to get to know someone before getting married," Joyce says.
Instead, in the case of a franchise partner, a sustainable agreement will be signed, a guarantee will be obtained and a new shop will be built.
To enter into a partnership with someone before you see how a person works is a huge step and a significant test of trust.
The symbiotic relationship between the parties is similar to a strong marriage, because they share common objectives, explains Lorraine McLachlan, Chairman and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
That is why McLachlan believes that the franchise entrepreneur should also be careful when choosing the future franchise giver before entering into such a long-term partnership.
"This is the same idea as human relationships: if a date partner is rude already on a date, imagine what he is like in marriage?" he says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose carefully and assess the future contractual partner and to draw attention to the smallest alerts from either side.
McLachlan adds that franchise givers such as Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time those acting as a franchise giver must be more careful when choosing the first, most important partners.
On the other hand, the new franchise providers have to conclude, on the basis of a supposed successful parent company, what challenges they have had to face and what skills the new franchise entrepreneur needs when facing similar difficulties.
For the first time, companies acting as franchise providers may also request the help of a franchise advisor to create a profile based on industry practices.
McLachlan also points out that for the first time as franchise providers and entrepreneurs, there is a great deal of help available on the CFA website at lokforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will be easier later because the franchise providers will learn to assess potential entrepreneurs better, but also because the first franchise entrepreneurs will be able to provide advice and help in the evaluation.
"The work of the first franchise partner helped Brian (the founder and CEO of Scudamore, 1-800-GOT-JUNK?) significantly in creating this company and the franchise system," says Erik Church, the operational director of O2E Brands. O2E Brands includes companies 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
The franchise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something he couldn't have created alone, so the first franchise entrepreneurs have to choose this idea in mind.
The Church has 216 franchise entrepreneurs, representing all three brands of O2E, and is also a partner of You Move Me, Toronto franchise.
The Chruchin method of finding the right franchise partner is simple.
"A confidence test we use is to ask myself, "Can I invite this person to my weekend barbecue?" he says.
"If the answer to this question is 'I', you probably don't want to spend much of your working day looking with them for solutions to major business challenges."
Church also points out that O2E Brands is to a large extent an appreciation of its franchise structure for its success.
In the business organisation, managers often see their position in the short term and their relationship with a lower management level as very formal, while franchise entrepreneurs engage in a partnership with long-term objectives and are thus more committed to the success of the company.
"The French partnership has much more advantages than the traditional business structure, but the partnership is also much more intense," he says.
This is a partnership, not a relationship between the Vice-President and the local operational director.
Such a partnership is more difficult, but, well-managed, it produces better results.
Rail delays are lowering cereal prices in the North of the United States
Delayed rail transport has led to a significant fall in cereals prices in the North of the United States, weeks before a massive harvest is expected to put the transport network under new pressure.
Commercial cereals in North Dakota offer farmers only $2.7 from the bus - about a dollar less than control prices - the main reason for ensuring the capacity of the rails to be received is the cost, the merchant and the agricultural organisations say.
IN Raw materials
The most acute problems are the BNSF railways of Warren Buffet Berkshire Hathaway and Canadian Pacific railways.
The federal railway supervisor will organise a hearing on service problems on Thursday.
In the northern plains, the railways have to be used for the transport of agricultural products, because they are far from river networks.
The delay in rail transport increased as a result of the very cold winter following the high harvest in 2013, which caused the slowing and reduction of trains.
Some farmers believe that the increased transport of crude oil from the oil leaching formation of North Dakota Bakken has replaced the transport of cereals, which is not the case according to the railway companies.
According to the director of an international grain trading company, the costs incurred by cereal storers and transferrs to ensure the use of the train have increased from zero to up to $2,000 per wagon per year.
Someone's got to pay the costs.
"These expenses are payable either by the farmer or by the customer," says the head of the grain trading company.
The US Agriculture Agency estimates that the soya bean harvest in North Dakota will increase by more than a third and 16% in the spring crop.
Randy Gordon, Chairman of the National Grain and Feed Association, says that "We are normally trying to start a new harvest on a clean table, that is to say, enough storage space has been exhausted for the harvest and the grain has been sold and moved.
However, we are now starting late due to the problems of the last year's service on the trains.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will handle the transport of this year's crops in a smooth manner.
John Miller, Vice-President of BNSF, responsible for the transport of agricultural products, said that the company had reduced the amount of long-term transport (railway wagons ordered by customers, which took more than four days to deliver) from the early peak of April to 16 500, to about two thousand.
"We have moved almost everything from the old harvest that we were supposed to move," Miller says, referring to the remaining grain of the previous harvest.
However, the latest reported speeds of the cereals trains of BNSF were nine per cent lower than in the second quarter of last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Mr Miller admits that the development is "unbalanced" but pointed out that the company is currently investing $5 billion in capital this year to improve the processing capacity of all types of transportable products, such as cereal peaks.
The speeds of Canadian Pacific trains affected by the second sum are 11% lower than in the same period last year, but are clearly higher than in the early years.
The Canadian Pacific railway company has told the Railway Supervisor (surface Transport Board) that the changes made to its system for ordering wagons should improve its capacity to deal with traffic in the coming harvest of 15-20%.
"The action plan for the autumn of the Canadian Pacific railway company focuses on the continuous improvement of the speed of trains and the efficient use of trains so that we can deliver more and more railway wagons every week," said the railway company's representative.
The crisis in Ukraine may solve NATO's "identity crisis"
The leaders, diplomats and experts of the great countries have often expressed concern about NATO's future and whether the end of NATO's mission in Afghanistan will also mean that NATO itself is concerned.
However, this concern is very premature, as is evident at the NATO Summit in Cardiff, Wales this week, with 60 leaders, including President Barack Obama.
There is no shortage of world crises on the agenda of politicians and diplomats, even to the extent that the withdrawal of Afghan troops, which was previously a priority, is no longer the most important issue.
On the other hand, the 28-state alliances are needed after Russia's re-integration into Ukraine, which is a shocking reminder that threatening Europe's independence is not necessarily just a part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways to punish Russia, but they will also move forces, promise more money for defence spending and re-commitment to defence co-operation.
In a sense, NATO is to thank Vladimir Putin.
"It (NATO) looked for its purpose in some way -- and was experiencing a fairly significant identity crisis," says Heather Conley, Director of the European programme of the Washington Center for Strategic and International Studies.
NATO has not only found a new purpose, but it has also been strengthened.
Obama has also added a new task to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to get world leaders to set up a common strategy to overthrow quickly the Islamic State's militias in Iraq and Syria.
According to official opinions, the President will face major challenges in trying to inspire his war-deprived partners to respond to military response, especially those that would cross the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to show that he is leading the world to find a strategy to overcome extremist Islamics, once he has said directly that 'we do not have a strategy'.
Western experts have placed careful expectations at the summit as to whether breakthroughs will be achieved when discussing Ukraine or the Islamic State.
Additional financial sanctions are planned to be the main penalty for an event called the Ukrainian attack on Russia.
The officials of the European Union discussed the matter during the weekend, but they postponed the decision on the new sanctions.
The US officials pointed out that the countries of which Obama hopes to work with the main partners in the Islamic problem are not necessarily members of NATO.
It was not possible to anticipate the accumulation of problems two years ago when the last NATO summit was held in Chicago, when the debate was dominated by the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
A year earlier, Robert M. Gates, then president, used his last speech to say that the organisation has almost reached the point of "common military importance".
U.S. officials constantly complained that other countries could not achieve their funding goals.
NATO members promise to spend 2% of their GDP on defence expenditure, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, the United Kingdom and the United States – achieved this goal last year.
Now, however, the White House officials say that they have noticed a change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff that promises to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time the company wanted to see potential threats in their actual size.
After Russia's invasion into Ukraine, the Union's "defence promises are more significant and important than ever after the end of the Cold War", says Charles Kupchan, Director General of the National Security Council of the United States.
We are quite hopeful that we will reach a consensus between the 28 Member States.
Obama is using a large part of his journey to strengthen his commitment to defence cooperation in favour of Russia's concerned neighbouring countries.
The President will start his three-day trip with a lasting visit to Tallinn, Estonia, where he will meet the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has recycled its troops in Estonia since Russia joined the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine this year, and NATO troops will be recycled regularly in Estonia when a new contingency plan to be published this week will be put in place.
The plan aims at shortening the time NATO needs to respond to attacks in the border states, says officials.
The plan is to increase air surveillance and other visible defence signs.
The changes present a small risk to NATO, which refrained from establishing permanent bases as a demonstration of East and Central Europe's kindness towards Russia.
According to the officials, the new plan does not actually break the agreement, but it can also be just a semantic difference, says a Western diplomat who did not want to name his name in the debate before the official announcement.
NATO's presence is likely to be described as long-term, not permanent, the diplomat said.
Does Putin use an effective "winter" in Ukraine?
Russian President Vladimir Putin has one ace in his sleeve with Ukraine.
The Western countries and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of arming the rebels in eastern Ukraine and sending Russian troops to Ukrainian soil.
That is why the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
Once the situation in Ukraine has tightened up, the Western countries are planning harder sanctions against Russia.
Russia, however, has a power card: winter is coming and Russia is the main source of energy for Ukraine.
According to the American authorities, Ukraine’s primary sources of energy are natural gas (40 %) and coal (28 %), according to Business Insider, Geysar Gurbanov, who works at Harvard University.
When the winter comes to Ukraine within the next four months and the coal mines are located in the east of the country's conflict, the Ukrainians will freeze to their homes when the gas supply from Russia is cut off.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, the Russian energy waste, will help Putin win the war in the end, Gurbanov writes.
Last year half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine on 16 July due to unpaid invoices.
Earlier this month Gazprom announced that Ukraine's debt of gas amounted to EUR 5.3 billion (approx. EUR 4 billion) by the end of August 1.
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the coming winter as follows:
I think that nobody thinks about it (winter) anymore, except for Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways to make it easier.
Firstly, the immediate cessation of hostilities and the repair of the necessary infrastructure.
The necessary repairs must be made in order to complete the warehouses again, and provision should be made for a cold period.
According to Business Insider, Putin's comment can be interpreted as a masked threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat before the separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman, a Japanese holding company in Nomura, pointed out last month that Russia's talks about humanitarian intervention and the planning of a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine would be strengthened in a few months if Russia could maintain separatists until then.
Moscow has already announced that Ukraine will have to pay in advance for future gas supplies unless the Kiev sector pays the accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement that would allow gas imports to continue temporarily.
Last week, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseni Follownuk said that Russia is planning to stop gas supplies to EU countries in winter.
Later, the Russian Minister for Energy, Alexander Novak, told us that the speeches were inexhaustible.
According to him, Russia will do its utmost to deliver gas to EU countries.
The liberal adjourned a ten-year prison sentence and a thousand rips.
The Saudi court has maintained the ten-year sentence issued to Raif Badaw, the founder of the liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement in May.
The judgment includes a further one thousand fines and one million fines (about EUR 200 000).
The judgment was justified by the fact that he had set up a website that undermines Islam.
On Monday AFP was informed of the judgment by the second founder of the organization, Suad al-Shamari.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was sentenced to seven years imprisonment and 600 raids in July 2013, but the sentence was appealed and referred back to court.
The judgment was also appealed in May, when Amnesty International also pointed out its injustice.
Madventures Riku Rantala childhood experience in Afghanistan: "It was one revolutionary human encounter"
The Madventures published today a new book on the World Explanation - the adventurer's explanation of everything.
We asked Riku Randala about the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
Riku also tells of the most important human encounter of his life.
The author, journalist, the other side of Madventures Riku Rantala is a busy man.
Today a new book has been published, yesterday there was a movie on the citizens' market, and on Wednesday the second production period of Ylella Docventures begins.
Ever since this morning, he's been running from place to place.
I've got a sausage from the morning TV to take the baby to the day care center and from there to the weekly meeting.
The interview that has been agreed upon must be transferred to a telephone interview.
I don't have time for that.
In the middle of all the hurry, he and Madventures in the other half, Tunna Milonoff have had time to stop and write a World Explanation book, which according to the cover of the book is an adventurer's manual for everything.
All of it?
Oh, that's a lot of promises.
The book considers a number of themes, such as what is our future, why another culture does worse than the other one, why we are here and who we really are.
We took advantage of the interviews we've been doing over the years.
The book includes both professors and artists.
We worked actively on the book for about a year, Riku tells IS on the phone.
You've been barking a pretty big piece into the book.
What is the most important message in the book?
The fact that we need to know more about the world and the big questions should be considered, because then we will be doing the best we can in this world.
On the other hand, the idis of the book is good travel reading, but it is also meant to get people at home to discuss and share ideas.
The conversation can even lead to action, Riku says.

One of the themes in your book is the future of the world.
What does it look like?
We concluded that the human race is optimistic.
Despite global warming and the current state of the earth, it is imperative to believe that at some point we will make decisions to improve our situation.
The earth is a kind of alcoholic.
It should first admit that we have a problem, only then can change, Riku philosophie.
Riku says that according to some studies, Western mankind has reached the peak of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, prosperity has not increased our happiness.
From this we can conclude that when we have enough money and our basic needs are satisfied, we are happy.
Money doesn't add to happiness.
So we want to wake people up and talk about what is enough.
Using our natural resources will not be enough for long, says Riku.
In your book, you also considered the differences between cultures.
How does an Indian person differ from a Finnish person?
People don't really differ much.
Of course, the starting points for education, healthcare and hygiene are different.
The biggest cultural difference is that the Community is much more important in India in terms of both good and bad.
Once the Western world has become prosperous, people will live more alone.
Isolate ourselves and may lead to loneliness and anxiety.
When we find a suitable balance between communityism and loneliness, we'd be pretty close to happiness, Riku says.
Riku has encountered a lot of different people in the world.
What human encounter has best come to his mind?
It is placed in my childhood, when I was with my family on my first bigger trip abroad.
We lived in India and Pakistan for a year while my father worked there for the United Nations.
I was seven years old, and two of my younger sisters were involved.
My brother was just a baby.
Home to Finland was carried by a large moving car.
We drove to war in Afghanistan when there were a huge number of refugees on the side of the road.
A girl my age walked along the road carrying her little brother in her arms.
I was sitting on a big mercenary seat with a coke can in my hand.
Our eyes crossed, Riku describes.
A child of your age realizes the situation.
It was one of the revolutionary human encounters I'll always remember.

Riku and Tunna at the book fair in 2013.
At the time Riku "goed into the cabbage" that other people must be respected even if they were much poorer or if they did not have the same conditions of life as ours.
By then, the ruin realized that money could not be a measure of human dignity.
From the memories of adults to the surface there are people in New Guinea.
I couldn’t stop wondering how traditional people live there.
They use natural materials for everything, not much use of money or metal tools.
They live under very challenging living conditions.
It's hard to survive.
It made me wonder.
And to think about it with Tunna, she wants to get her new book readers.
The idea is that our book inspires people to read, watch, and listen more.
To get people to act from warm-minded lovemaking to conversation or even to fist fight, Riku throws.
That's what the Kauhajok magazine says.
The events started when the couple arrived at the station by bus and ordered a taxi.
When the cab started to move, the man in the yard threw an object after the cab.
The driver got out of the car, so did the man who was the passenger.
The man who threw it on the scene stabbed the male passenger life-threateningly in the head and in the hand and left the scene.
The knifer is a five-foot-five-foot, short-haired man.
According to the paper, there was a young, blonde ponytailed woman around the scene.
They're hoping he'll contact the police.
The police are also asking for clues from anyone who may have made observations about events or persons involved in the case.
The stab wound occurred on Wednesday, August 27th, about 7.50 p.m.
"Hello!" said the brain to the brain - the world's first "telepathic" message passed through the Internet
The publication PLOS ONE has published an article according to which the international team of researchers has managed to convey the message directly to the mind.
The first messages sent through the system were "hola" and "ciao", i.e. "hi" in Spanish and Italian.
The test was conducted to monitor the electrical brain curve of the dispatcher.
The sender was trained by the program to send bits either by thinking about the movement of the hand or leg.
The imagination of the leg movement was interpreted as zero, and moving hands to number one.
This bit-coded information was sent online to the receiver.
A magnetic stimulation was used to induce the recipient to detect a flash of light for each single bit encoded.
The recipient was taught to interpret the flashes as a message.
Researchers admit that this is still an area of research in their children’s shoes, but believe that computer-assisted telepathic communication is routine in the near future of mankind.
Penalties - Point - The future of rural areas
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also blackmailing its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States not to react when Russia is at war in Ukraine and occupied Crimea.
In international politics, action follows reaction, action countermeasures.
Experience shows that all sanctions will only be bitten in the long term.
Iran was not allowed to be subject to negotiations on its nuclear programme until years later.
The South African Racial Government sat in place for decades, even though trade was banned by UN decisions.
There have also been sanctions against Russia.
During the Cold War, no high-end electronics or military technology could be exported to the Soviet Union.
Russia itself has put barriers to trade on the world's page.
Last time I checked, there was a freezing of the raw wood trade.
It is clear that sanctions will not bring Russia to its knees.
The Russians are used to bad times and the disappearance of Viola from the store is not causing panic.
When the EU intends to ban imports of vodka from Russia, it is mainly a joke.
The Russians would love to drink that vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to export aircraft to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
The gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The biggest disadvantage to Russia is not to steal imports of cheese or exports of vodka.
The greatest harm comes from restrictions in the financial sector.
They won't work until the future.
The Russian State cannot operate on the international loan market.
It has to shorten old loans, but it's hard to take a new one.
Even though Russia has huge foreign reserves, they cannot last forever either.
Access to credit for Russian companies is fading and money is tilting.
Their own banks are not able to fund everyone.
More money needs to be printed, or there will be payment difficulties for companies.
Bankruptcy is also bankruptcy in Russia, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, Russian modernisation will stop, as Russian expert René Nyberg wrote in Helsingin Sanoma.
It wouldn't be the first time.
In time, Russia would return to Russia once again and then go inward.
An exceptional free-painting event was organised in North Korea
Some 10,000 North Koreans, as well as a number of diplomats, followed the international free-time matches held in Pyongyang, the capital on Saturday.
Antonio Inoki, a Japanese lawyer who moved from law enforcement to free wrestling, took part in the event involving wrestling from Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to free press matches, taekwondo matches were also seen for local athletes.
According to Inok, the aim of the event was to bring the countries in dispute closer through sport and promote world peace.
In their speeches, politicians hoped for an improvement between North Korea and Japan.
In the summer, Japan removed the sanctions it had imposed on North Korea as a result of the Japanese abductions in the 1970s and 1980s.
On the other hand, North Korea promised to reopen the investigation into these cases.
The last time we saw an international freemasonry in North Korea was in 1995.
SOK reduces about 110 persons from the FTA.
The negotiations started in June, when the need for a reduction was estimated to be up to 130.
According to the company, overlapping functions have now been removed from its organisation and responsibilities have been clarified.
SOK states that it is clearly seeking better cost-effectiveness and synergies between different sectors of activity.
In addition to the economic downturn and the decline in demand for consumers, the structural change in trade, which has shaken trade in consumer goods in particular, is behind the background.
The result of the S-Group commodity trade has been at a loss for some time.
The negotiations concerned all employees and management of SOK’s daily and operating assets, i.e. approximately 530 persons.
Turku Sanomat: Some of the self-medicants behind the counter
According to the paper, there are more medicines coming between prescriptions and those that can be taken from the shelf without a prescription, but only after the advice of the pharmacist’s worker.
According to the Finnish Pharmacopoeia Association, eye drops containing antibiotics, for example, could be covered by advice.
After interviewing a pharmacist or pharmacist and meeting pre-defined criteria, the medicine could be given from behind the counter, considering Kirsi Kvarnström, Chairman of the Pharmacovigilance Association, Turku Sanoma.
There are already a few medicines available in Finland without a prescription, but they require advice.
One of these is a post-prophylactic product.
Corruption for more accurate reasons
Finland is paying more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by both the OECD and the Council of Europe, as the world is amazed by the limited number of bribes and convictions in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Working Party of the Ministry of Justice will consider whether provisions on trade and abuse of influence would be required in the Criminal Code.
The differences in legislation were highlighted, for example, at the trial of the Slovene branch of Patria, Hämeenlinna, a year ago.
The trade of influence brought a two-year sentence to the former Prime Minister in Slovenia, but the Finnish law does not know the corresponding criminal code.
The anti-corruption cooperation network has intensified its cooperation as required by the Government Programme.
According to a recent survey, corruption is not much investigated in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered a report from the University of Vaasa and the Police University of Applied Sciences on corruption in different areas.
Messi potee nipple injury - Sport - Karjalainen
Captain Lionel Messi of the football team in Argentina will be absent from Wednesday's country match against Germany.
The Mass will have a groin injury on the side of the viewer, told by his company Barcelona on Monday.
Barcelona sees Mess as a precaution.
The Messi hurt the groin in the league fight against Villareal on Sunday.
Barcelona won the 1-0 match.
Messi also missed a charity match in Rome.
Wanderers coach Tony Popovic thinks he's getting cover for the Asian Champions League battle in Korea.
Tony Popovic is missing three key players in Korea.
Many Western Sydney Wanderers players are banned in the first match, and Coach Tony Popovic does not hesitate to throw other players in the Asian Champions League witch boiler FC Seoul.
The Wanderers are in Dubai at a 10-day training camp, which also includes two friendship matches in Abu Dhab, so that the team can prepare for the first semifinal match to be held on 17 September.
Because of excessive yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole will skip Korea's trip, but Coach Popovic believes in their replacements.
"Of course this is a loss – they have been three very important players in ACL for us," Popovic says.
Tomi Juric was banned from this gesture in China.
It is a setback, none of the players should be absent, but we did not have Mattya (Spiranovic) in the first game, and until now Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Whoever comes in, I'm sure he's done a lot of work, and I trust the whole team.
I'm not afraid to play against anyone at the semifinals.
The Wanderers also have to be without Spiranovic, which is still recovering from ankle surgery.
The defenseman of The Socceroos was injured before the beginning of the season, but has continued to run, and it is possible that he will play in the return match at Pirtek Stadium on 1 October.
"He's back in his career, and he's going to be fine," Popovic says.
He follows his own training program and goes with us to Dubai, which is great news for him, because it means gradually returning to the field.
He's already done practice a couple of times outside, which is good.
It'll take some time before he's completely fine, but he'll be fine.
In Dubai, the Wanderers team has the world-class facilities at Al Sheba Sports Complex.
According to Popovic, a trip to Dubai is also a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after the major changes at the end of last season.
"We know this will help players to make connections," Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players, and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better, both on and off the field.
So we use the camp for many purposes.
The elite burger pays three times the monthly salary of the worker
01.09.2014 21:18 In North Korea you can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if you happen to be part of the country's elite.
The financial Times tell us about the economy torn by the opposites.
In North Korea, the informal market may flourish more than ever.
They offer a luxury to wealthy or saving ordinary citizens, which is not used to connecting with a dictatorship state.
The Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: the entertainment center, for which only a ticket costs up to ten months of regular workman's salary.
It's a place where you can get burgers who pay $76.
That's three to five months' salary for the country's usual duel.
In the pool, men drink beer in shorts.
Life looks expensive and nice.
The North Korean 'Western Market' began in the 1990s when the country suffered from famine.
The government allows them to exist, even though the prices of supplies can be gross.
Yet, in the capital of Pyongyang, many people have a mobile phone with an O.R.H. of $200.
There may be some reason for the ruler of Kim Jong-un, 31, who has tried to create an energetic and youthful image of himself.
In his time, the administration has stressed the importance of technology in the prosperity of the earth.

Ormiston House: Stormont Council hopeful of sales
The Stormont Council is hopeful that it has found a buyer at Ormiston House, a building in Belfast that paid taxpayers nearly £3,000 a week.
The Council bought a building from the 19th century in the eastern part of the city 13 years ago and paid £9 million for it.
The Council failed to sell the building further, when the security and maintenance of the building came to the Council for about £400 a day.
The building was sold at £1.25 million a year ago.
Obviously, the building will be used as a private residential building.
The Council bought a class B building of historical value by GBP 9 million in 2001, because it needed more office space.
However, it was later found that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the purchase of the building, it was resold for sale at the price of GBP 2,5 million this time.
The building was not sold and the price was calculated.
Last year, Mike Nesbitt, the Ulster Unionist party, suggested that Ormiston House might be able to fit into the premises of a new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it is negotiating the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner once the paperwork is completed.
Both the Council and the real estate agent remain silent about the identity of the buyer and the selling price.
The weekly safety and repair costs of Ormiston House are about £3,000.
The Council bought the building from the police forces that preceded Northern Ireland’s Political Board.
By the beginning of this year, Ormiston House’s security costs amounted to GBP 885 641 and maintenance costs to GBP 371 379.
The price of professional services related to repair and maintenance was GBP 250 015 and the fees of development and design professionals were GBP 212 466.
The building was previously owned by Sir Edward Harland, a shipbuilder who lived in the building until 1887 when it was purchased by William Pirrie, the business partner of Harland. Pirrie later became Chairman of Harland & Wolff.
Soon after Lord Pirrie's death, 1924 Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building. The company sold it to Campbell College, which held it until the mid-70s.
"Difference is increasing": Helsinki intends to reduce the number of school assistants
There's no saving, JHL claims.
Helsinki is preparing for a radical reduction in the number of school-based school-based aiders.
The reduction would not apply to the child's personal assistant.
In spring, the Helsinki Education Board decided to present a total of 2.7 million reductions from the resources of school assistants.
Helsinki has a total of about 600 school assistants.
If the contractions occur, they will enter into force in the middle of the academic period from the beginning of the year.
According to JHL, the decision increases inequalities.
A growing number of children need support in learning.
However, it is regrettable that it is easy to reduce aid for savings because the amount of aid for learning is not clearly defined in the law.
Savings are certainly not created; on the contrary, the workload of teaching staff is increasing.
For schoolchildren, savings pose a greater risk of falling away from learning goals and the ability of teachers is tough, stressing Päivi Niemi-Laine, CEO of JHL.
The plans of the City of Helsinki are disparaging schools, as small schools and pupils in need of support will no longer receive any resources from assistants.
The aim of the City of Helsinki is to prevent exclusion.
It is school assistants who are doing effective preventive work.
However, the Agency's adaptation measures are largely targeted at this group.
All parties will suffer from this in the future.
The final solution to the resources will be made in the autumn by the City Council of Helsinki, for which I hope to look to the future and to act in accordance with its objectives, says Niemi-Laine.
Israel Conquests the Earth on the West Bank
The women of Israel walk in a Jewish settlement called Gevaot near Bethlehem in the region of Etzion.
On Sunday, Israel conquered nearly 400 acres of land on the West Bank in a Jewish settlement near Bethlehem, which may be a sign of Israel’s future remarkable construction in the region, and at the same time defies the Palestinians’ request not to build more settlements and to oppose the general opinion of the world community.
The Israeli 'Peace Now' Group, which is opposed to the expansion of the West Bank's institutions, believed that the events on Sunday could be the largest individual takeover of the country in the West Bank for decades and could 'dramatically change the situation in the region'.
The goal of the Palestinians is to establish their own state for the countries conquered by Israel in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, the political impetus for assessing the situation in the land came after three Israelis were kidnapped and killed in June after they were taken up in the area.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian accused of kidnapping and killing.
The timing of the takeover of the land suggests that it was intended as a form of compensation for the population of the settlement and punishment of the Palestinians.
The land near the Jewish Gevaot settlement in the Etzio region of South Jerusalem has now been officially declared a "state land" when it was previously privately owned by the Palestinians. This was a necessary step to allow Israel to start planning buildings in the area if it so wishes.
However, Mayor Ahmad Lafi of the nearby Palestinian city of Surif said that the country belongs to the Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian official news agency WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff published early on Sunday provisions stating that Israel would take over the olive and other trees of Surif and nearby villages, Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin.
Any objections should be raised within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people led the Israeli army to discipline on the West Bank against the Islamic group that ruled Gaza, Hamas, which Israel says was behind the kidnappings.
The tensions followed on the border between Israel and Gaza covered the 50 - day war that ended last week with a ceasefire in Egypt.
The takeover of the land has quickly brought attention to the West Bank, which is dominated by the Israelis, and has revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli Government, which make it difficult to develop more widely the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
The crisis in Lapland is usually multi-problematic.
An increasing number of municipalities in Lapland are in trouble, as shown by a welfare study prepared by the University of Lapland and the University of Applied Sciences.
There are no quick solutions to crisis problems.
According to the professor, a billion euro reduction in municipal tasks is not enough.
Among the common features of crises are weak municipal economy, poor employment and migration losses.
According to Asko Suikkanen, Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Lapland, new crisis situations are coming from the western border and the Eastern Child.
In the survey’s questionnaire, the population assessed the situation in their municipalities quite realisticly.
In the study, the inhabitants of well - qualified municipalities even took a pessimistic view of the outlook.
High expectations affect consumption.
People hope that the present day’s everyday life and well - being will be preserved, perhaps even slightly improved.
In this time there is no courage to think about longer-term investments, such as buying a dwelling, says Suikkanen.
The team of researchers surprised the large differences between municipalities.
For example, income support expenditure per capita varies from a couple of tens to over 100 euros.
Government tax revenues per capita vary from two thousand euros to 4400 euros from Ranua’s fair to Pelkosenniemi.
According to Suikkanen, the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How money is spent, how much state-owned and what is the degree of debt, is different in local governments in similar situations, he says.

The United Kingdom may close the borders of Islamic fighters returning to the country.
The United Kingdom may temporarily prevent the return of Islamic fighters to Iraq and Syria.
It's BBC, referring to government sources.
However, according to the BBC, British citizens suspected of terrorism would be allowed to hold their own.
According to the government source, this is one of many proposals that are being considered.
The proposal is currently being finalised and Prime Minister David Cameron is due to present it.
The government is also looking for ways to make it difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way may be to increase the authority's powers so that they can temporarily confiscate the passports of potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, Britain raised the possibility of a terrorist threat to the second highest level.
Bob Carr is delighted with the immediate release of the Australian lawyer, Melinda Taylor, from the Libyan prison.
The Australian lawyer, Melinda Taylor, is expected to be released from the Libyan prison today.
The federal government was pleased with the news that the Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
The Foreign Minister, Bob Carr, said that "it's going to be all right" and the ICC's lawyer will be released from custody by the Australian authorities tonight, after which he will be on a plane flying to Europe by midnight.
"We are pleased with the news that he is likely to be released today," commented the representative to the AAP News Office in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanked the wider international community for its assistance and support, said the representative.
Taylor is likely to fly to Rome before he continues his journey to his home in The Hague.
Taylor and his three colleagues in the criminal court were arrested in the Libyan city of Zintani on 7 June, representing Seif al-Islam, son of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddaf.
According to the Libyan authorities, Taylor took papers to Seif that they thought threatened national security.
Senator Carr has gone to a lot of trouble to free Taylor, including traveling to the capital of Libya to Tripoli last month to run this thing.
Taylor couldn't talk to her husband or little daughter until last week.
Senator Carr said Taylor was allowed to make a brief call to his home in The Hague shortly after the visit of Australian Ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke with Taylor’s parents in Brisbane, John and Janelle, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally allowed to use the phone.
Taylor’s parents had appealed to Libya to release his daughter before this little baby’s third birthday in July.
Three other criminal lawyers are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
A week ago, Mr Carr said that as a result of the debate between the lawyer released in The Hague and the Libyan authorities, "the criminal court lawyer was sorry and apologized for any misunderstanding".
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of mistakes, but has promised to examine the activities of its team thoroughly once its members return home.
"After the International Criminal Court has closed its investigation, it will ensure that all those who have acted wrong will be properly convicted", the Court announced in its notice last month.
The International Criminal Court is suing 39-year-old Seif Al-Islamic for crimes against humanity during his father's reign, which ended surprisingly last year.
According to Tripoli, his trial should be local and he took an initiative on 1 May declaring that he did not accept the decision of the criminal court's lawyer to hold a trial in The Hague.
Young newcomer saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona won its second victory in the early stages of the Spanish football league, but with ease Villarreal did not fall at home.
The blue-red stab their heads on the Villarreal guard Sergio Positionjoi until the 82nd minute finally succeeded.
The winner was a surprising man: a 19-year-old, first-time attacker in La Liga, Sandro Ramirez had only come to the field 12 minutes earlier.
The young man who received an invitation from the second team in Barcelona to attend the mission team finished close after Asenjo had rejected Lionel Mess’s company.
The collections to Ferguson police ended mysteriously after the overrun of $433,000
The administrators closed two online collection sites without explanation this weekend after the sites were collected for over $400 000 for the police who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri.
On the website of GoFundMe, which is open to the general public, two separate pages bearing similar names – "Support Office Darren Wilson" and "Support Office Wilson" – have collected 235 750 dollars and $197 620 for the Ferguson police who shot Michael Brown.
A similar site, maintained by Brown’s family’s attorney, had collected $314 099 after Sunday afternoon.
The shooting was followed by many weeks of unrest and demonstrations, mostly against the almost white police forces of the black-dwelling Ferguson, which forced Wilson to hide while the local and federal studies were trying to decide whether or not to shoot Brown for no reason.
The network's collection campaigns have caused some noise about Wilson's defense, especially since some visitors had written comments on racist comments that have been removed since then.
Both pages apparently ceased to receive donations at about the same time on Saturday, and the administrators of the pages did not give any reason for it.
If you try to give a donation, you will see a message saying, "Donations will no longer be accepted!
The organizer has stopped collecting donations.
On Sunday, a representative of the GoFundMe website provided a newsletter to the Los Angeles Times stating that the site has not prevented donations from being made.
"Every GoFundMe campaign organiser will decide when to stop receiving donations," said Kelsea Little, a representative of the GoFundMe website.
The organisers may also continue to receive donations later, if they so wish.
The "Support Officer Wilson" page, with a return of $197,620, is maintained by a charity group of St. Louis police officers called Shield of Hope, who is the recipient of donations approved by the GoFundMe website.
On Sunday, the three police officers Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda, registered as official representatives of the State Collection Register of the Shield of Hope, did not reply immediately to the e-mails asking for further information on the collection campaign.
Zoll is an official informant of the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a member of the Florissant City Council and a member of the Roorda Missouri Chamber.
The Times also did not immediately contact the anonymous founder of the "Support Officer Darren Wilson" page, who uses the name "Stand Up" and has raised $235 750. He has not been confirmed as the recipient of donations approved by the website.
However, the representative of the GoFundMe site assured The Times that an anonymous benefactor existed.
The anonymous benefactor of the collection campaign has been given only a limited amount of information to donors, unlike the administrators of another Wilson page or Brown donation site.
The benefactor of the anonymous Wilson page wrote a message to visitors of the website two weeks ago that the site cooperates with the Shield of Hope Group to become an officially accepted recipient of donations.
The approval has not yet been granted.
The benefactor provided the desired visitors with an e-mail address with an alias, but did not respond immediately to the request for additional information on Sunday.
The representative of the GoFundMe page said in his release to The Times that the anonymous collection page has been removed from the search results of the main website and added that "this campaign will no longer meet the requirements of the GoFundMe website that require a functioning Facebook account".
In the context of information security practices on the GoFundMe website, users are invited to "donate only to GoFundMe users, who they know and trust in".
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the content of the collection page published on the GoFundMe site is correct and honest.
According to Mr Little, however, GoFundMe has been in contact with the campaign organiser and there is no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to hold all the funds collected if there is a need to start studies in connection with a campaign.
However, GoFundMe has not considered it appropriate to reserve the funds collected by this campaign.
The popular Facebook page "Support Officer Wilson", which has organised campaigns to support Wilson, told the followers of the page during the weekend that lawyers are trying to find a "interpretation" why the donors of the GoFundMe website have been prevented from giving, but the page did not provide any further information.
There is also an anonymous administrator on the Facebook page, and an independent source has not been able to confirm these comments.
Arsenal's top-notch on the end of the year - Valioliga - Ilta-Sanaomat
The English Valoliga Arsenal French predator Olivier Giroud is likely to be sidelined until the end of the year.
Giroud's ankle was cut on Wednesday and recovery takes months.
Giroud hurt his leg this weekend in the Valoliga fight against Everton.
The operation went well, but he's on the side until he can play top level, until the end of December or early January, Arsenal's chief coach, Arsene Wenger, said to Sky Sports.
Giroud was Arsenal's best scorer with 16 hits last season, so the loss is evident.
According to Wenger, however, he does not necessarily acquire a seat for Giroud during this transfer window.
Wenger was playing the latest acquisition of Alexis Sanchez on Wednesday at the Masters League's finals against Besiktas.
Arsenal won 1-0 on Sanchez's goal.
Hollywood famous nude photos circulate online - hacking suspected

Medium Finnish: Finns rely on the safety of online banks
Most Finns rely on the safety of online banks, reported by Central Finland.
According to a survey carried out by the magazine, four out of five consider the security of online banks to be good.
The age of the respondents is clearly shown in the answers.
Young people, the least retired, believe in the safety of online banks.
Tuula Sario, the leading lawyer of the Consumer Union, is not surprised by the views.
A lot of internet users generally rely most on its services.
Those who do not use the services are ignorant and suspicious, he wonders in Central Finland.
The majority of Finns are customers of some online bank.
The most common thing to do is to use the computer, but the use of mobile devices is becoming more and more common.
A thousand Finns replied to the questionnaire by Tietykkönen Oy in August.
The error margin is three percentage points.
Jens Lapidus and the Bridge series scriptwriter to do a series of crimes together
Jens Lapidus, one of Sweden's most famous crime writers, and Hans Rosenfeldt, who made the popular Silta series, together prepares a new TV series.
The 10-part series of Advokaten will start next year.
The Swedish production company Tre Vänner reported on the project on Monday in the press release.
The series has been bought by the Swedish TV4.
The third author of the series is Michael Hjort.
In Stockholm, Advokaten tells of a young lawyer named Frank, who, in one case, finds dark connections between his own family and infamous criminal groups.
The criminal writer Lapidus, who has become famous with the money, is a defence lawyer from his civil profession.
