The Prague stock exchange was negative at the end of the trade.
The Prague stock exchange adjusted its losses after the crash this morning.
Transactions with the shares in the Czech Energy Industry (ČEZ) accounted for nearly half of the usual daily trade.
The Prague stock exchange continued to fall on Monday from the beginning of Tuesday’s trade, when it fell almost six percent.
This time Wall Street's shares are falling behind the decline.
We also have a market response to the result of the vote in the American Parliament which refused to support the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Loss of shares in Asia
On the Asian stock exchange, the dramatic fall of the shares took place on Tuesday, although the indicators during the day were finally cancelled part of the losses.
Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange Index has written almost four percent during trading, but later, part of the losses have been cancelled and the decrease has been reduced to about 2.5 percent.
In the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Hang Seng China Enterprises Index dropped 3.8 percent, and markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares in the Sydney Stock Exchange have lost more than five percent, but ultimately the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
Taiwann Stock Exchange, according to the index there, fell by 3.6 percent.
"The timing of the American rescue action is uncertain and affects the world's financial markets," Joseph Yam noted, Head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are on the same level as the United States.
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the US legislators should renegotiate the negotiations immediately and accept the proposal for financial system support.
Otherwise, there is a threat that other countries will also feel the consequences of this.
U.S. shares' blood bath
On Monday, the U.S. Congress rejected the draft financial system support, to which $700 billion (almost 12 trillion kroons) should have been paid.
The legislators therefore ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush said that the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
On Monday, the American stock exchange survived a blood bath and the leading stock indices recorded the largest fall in 20 years.
Dow Jones fell by almost seven percent, had a similar fall last year in 1987.
The index came before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal was not adopted in the House, the index began to fail.
Congress has gone back, so the US government can pump $700 billion into the banks.
The main leaders of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed in the broader form of the agreement and the financial assistance to the US financial system.
This will be voted at the beginning of next week.
U.S. legislators have completed a breakthrough in negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of a financial assistance to the US financial system of USD 700 billion (approximately 12 trillion kroons).
But there's no win yet.
The Convention must finish some details of the agreement before it can be made public in the final form and vote of the law.
The draft financial system's support will be discussed at the Assembly on Monday.
On Sunday, he informed the Reuters News Agency Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee of Financial Organisations.
According to Senate sources, the draft may probably be voted on Wednesdays as soon as possible.
According to journalists, there should be an announcement that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor for the recovery of the financial markets.
However, because of the complexity of the mechanisms, there will be "predictation".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step.
We have solved our different views on the form of the market stabilisation package," the Bloomberg Agency mentioned Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
He said that the final vote would take place on Sunday.
On Saturday night, the lawyers met Henry Paulson, the U.S. Finance Minister, to give the government fund a final form.
This should result in the purchase of unsold mortgage activities from financial companies, which cause financial companies to suffer serious losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are asking for a final agreement on a draft that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
The repairing plan needs to be continued, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Report to Asian Trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets that fall sharply.
According to Senator Harry Reid's Democrat, the lawmakers are therefore trying to reach an end in Congress on Sunday.
This is why they want to reassure investors before trade in Asian money markets is launched, where Congress's decision on Monday's trade could be the first to be affected by the time zone.
However, it is not clear yet, when two chambers of American Congress vote on the law, just as it does not, whether the trial can not go away at the last minute because of any problem.
Lawmakers hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is going through a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system shall be divided into two parts.
As requested by President Bush, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, the Convention may block the issue of the remaining amount, which has been further determined in USD 100 billion and later in USD 350 billion, provided that it feels that the programme does not fulfil its function.
Bush assessed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may object to this decision, Congress may overestimate its vote.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program was to obtain financial assets for the purchase of the wrong mortgage securities losing their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to delete mortgage loans.
"We've worked everything out.
The law should be able to vote on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican.
With the progress made in the negotiations, the American President Bush is satisfied.
Tony Fratto, spokesperson of Bush, said that the president was satisfied with Saturday's progress and assessed the two-party efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of bus terminals
Christopher Dodd, president of the Banking Committee leading the negotiations, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of benefits and the timing of the draft financing.
The new law also restricts the so-called "best performance" of the programme managers and establishes a Board of Supervisors.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and which will be useful for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance to houseowners who have problems with deleting.
The government should establish new instalments for the mortgage purchased by it, with the aim of reducing the monthly instalments of debtors and enabling them to keep their homes.
Marek: Mental Help
David Marek, leader of Patria Finance, said it was a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"It's because it's not possible to know what kind of mechanism they're going to buy.
This will be decisive for the financial sector and the government to divide losses among themselves," said the week iHNed.cz website Marek.
According to Marek, it is not so important that the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week.
"It is more important that the convention should decide this week to support the plan and give their blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual importance of reaching an agreement on the approval of the plan is the most important thing at this moment," Marek stressed.
Couple of blades: MP3 players v. cell phones.
We'll help you choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can play.
It seems clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why you should get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on how it is used and the needs of the prospective owner.
Probably hard to get home a high-quality expensive record player to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on bakery records, but there is no objective reason for this to happen in qualitative terms.
However, if the shelf are full of art rock, jazz or blue ball albums, it is likely to dream of such a record player.
Similarly, it is simplified with MP3 music intended for travel, i.e. compressed.
There are also price and quality categories.
Some people are unacceptable to issue eight thousand kroons for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan may find it difficult to accept a 20-pound market earphone.
Two extremities, each of which has enough room for everyone.
There's a wide selection.
The lifetime of the elements is also relevant.
Some high-quality music players can play much more than the simple play of music, but also to what most mobile players do not even happen to.
None of the devices now are as universal as the phone.
The primary features, the phone and text, can also play music and video, take both, have a better, worse camera, even navigation.
And if we take into account the smartphones and the communicators, he'll have a little computer in his pocket.
It's a little wonder, because no fridge can grill and no television can take a photo.
There are also disadvantages for multiple functional mobiles.
The more functions you use on your cell phone, the more times the display is sent to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy absorbers.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, mostly less.
In this respect, musical players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap cell phones, consider that they won't play for you for more than a few hours.
If you even call and call here, please get another charger for safety at work - it also applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will not have such a problem, even worse ones will survive at least 9 hours of continuous operation with a charge.
The next issue arises when you upload the music to your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices have a universal USB constant and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without any special software.
Of course, the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers do without the adapter using miniature memory cards for mobile devices.
For players, you do not need any special software with some exceptions (iPod).
Enough to download the device from the computer via USB.
The majority of mobile and play players are already creating a musical library based on the author, the name of the album, the genre, or, for example, the user's evaluation.
Some devices display only wooden structures similar to Windows Explorer, and some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to handle, the phones can do more
In the selection of the specific equipment, the battery life, memory capacity, the quality and type of the audio output, and, of course, the comfort of the treatment should be sought.
If the music primarily serves you as a background, and listens only for a short time a day, for example, any mobile that plays MP3 matches you.
And that's what any cell phone can do.
You don't have to pay particular attention to what musical formats the mobile or player knows.
With MP3 each will cope and the crucial majority of the music you receive will be in such a format.
MP3 is among the most extensive and apart, the decisive majority of devices are also dealt with by WMA-shaped music.
The AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod) is less common.
Better mobiles, for example, also allow online music shopping.
Enough to visit the appropriate pages of the provider (or other providers) and buy the song or album through mobile internet.
This service can already be a serious argument for obtaining music on its own.
Unfortunately, the supply of service providers is limited to poor and, generally speaking, only one-by-one radio hits.
The prices are neither the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that the music will manage the music industry in the future (although through GSM, Internet or wireless internet).
Most people keep their mobile devices on their own all the time.
Whenever he wants to listen to something, he takes his cell phone out in his pocket, while the forgotten MP3 player is at home.
However, it also depends on whether he always wears earphones or at least exhilaratings.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker with almost all mobile devices, but only a few MP3 players.
A lot of people will probably have the biggest advantage of musical phones.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get a decent walkman.
However, you are mostly limited by the lack of traditional earphone output.
The telephones most equipped from the best and technical point of view may also be placed in 18 thousand crowns with traditional earphones with a diameter of 3,5 mm.
The advantage of players, however, is easy to manage.
The simplest - certainly not necessarily the most cheap players (see our options) will indeed be dealt with by everyone.
Minimum function, treatmentability comparable to a previously ordinary tape recorder or gramophone is obvious.
There's no threat of collapse in the form of an accidentally activated mobile internet, nor of a giant invoice following the transfer of data.
What device to choose
The cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) have usually openings on interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
You can also buy the right card into a maximum of two thousand kroons.
But be careful.
The basic types support only cards with maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive can get what to do with up to 8 GB memory cards.
If you have a mobile phone and even a cheap MP3 player you want to buy, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or irivert.
Based on capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not need to spend more than 1 100 kroons.
If you belong to more demanding students, choose special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, so the comfort of the treatment is close to the MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, the most beautiful in the sector, has the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above mentioned brands can provide the same service in the same price category up to 4 000 kroons, but with higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider is going to Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The Czech mobile market is relatively developed and our service providers offer practically the same services as their western European partners.
Nevertheless, there is something missing here - the virtual service that forces classic service providers to reduce material prices.
Maybe it won't be that long.
On the Mobil.cz website, we have often written that Czech service providers in Europe are among the most expensive.
This was confirmed by the Czech Republic, which pointed out that the price of text in Czech Republic was more expensive than in other countries of the Union.
Following the Commission's recent move to regulate roaming charges, this may lead to a conflicting situation - some Czech mobile operators will be cheaper than the Hungarians.
How is it possible that prices in Czech countries are so high when compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, missing the competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound contradictory, since we have three mobile networks and our penetration is over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, Pavel Dvořák, who has said, on several occasions, that there is no room for a new service provider in the Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classic service provider may no longer have too much chance with its own network (although it would probably find it difficult to find frequency already).
But there is another possibility - the virtual service provider.
It was about a significant drop in prices from virtual service providers to the mobile market, which would then have to be reacted to by classic service providers.
In the meantime, even before the entry into the market of large fish such as Tesco Mobile or Virginia Mobile Great Britain, sound like mines were heard.
However, it has proved that such service providers have a place and that they can succeed.
For example, however, we do not have to go too far.
In February this year, we informed you about the departure of the mobileking virtual service provider in Poland.
This service provider has not been able to obtain more than 100,000 customers over a period of six months and become the fifth largest provider there.
In the meantime, behind Mobilking, the Penta financial group is owned by U:fon, in Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much narrower target group.
For efficient operation, the traditional service provider needs far less customers.
There is no relatively high cost of construction, mobile network operation and maintenance.
Virtual service providers in the world are thus generally seen as low cost - cheap calls and text messages, which are often counterbalanced by less service.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers textings at least fifty percent cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good move towards a target group.
This provider is particularly focused on men.
"The real men choose the Mobiling service - who they like to trust," says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobil Entertainment Company operating this virtual service provider.
It is difficult to say whether the idea like that in Poland can happen to us.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesperson of Vodafone, puts it into question: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmented approach based on the majority of virtual service providers.
In addition, the supply of services is relatively satisfactory."
In Czech Republic, there is no possibility for mobile operators to claim
However, it seems almost certain that if there are a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about a successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic, consultations do not seem to be too hopeful.
In order to launch Mobilking, it is in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničková, spokesperson of the Penta Financial Group in her phone interview with Mobil.cz.
In this respect, it has been demonstrated that the existing mobile service providers in Czech are not too much of akin to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competition is established.
The GTS Novera Group has not been hiding its interest in the launch of the virtual service provider for some time, which therefore intends to take another step in making Telenica O2 a real competitor in the corporate client field.
"We are very interested in providing our customers not only fixed but mobile telecommunications services.
The sooner the better.
We discussed this possibility repeatedly with all Czech mobile service providers.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, the spokesperson of the group.
Maybe better times are coming.
From unofficial information, we seem to be lucky for the first virtual service provider by the end of the year.
His birth, however, is surrounded by a wall of silent silence which is still inconclusive.
"In this moment, we do not think that a full-value virtual service provider would have a place on the Czech market.
In contrast to other markets, the Czech market is very special.
Until now, we have not been invited by a single subject offering complex and serious projects in this area," he mentioned to Mobil.cz about the Press Division of Vlastil Sršeň, Telefónica 02.
It refers to the special situation of the Czech market, as well as the other service providers.
Martina Kemrova, the spokesperson of T-Mobile, with the exception of O2, says: "We have not yet noted any viable and bilaterally beneficial business projects to which we could continue to base."
And he added: "The T-Mobile network at the end of the year is unlikely to appear in any virtual service provider.
At this point, there should be a specific agreement on our table so that you can think in such a short time."
Vodafone’s attention is rather turned to meeting its own 3G licence requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds to this: "We have been able to negotiate with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure sharing.
That's exactly what we consider to be the most affordable for customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is partnering in building networks shared with the fast mobile internet."
Responsible offices - a string with service providers
The mobile service providers' procedure would easily be understood, the entry of a new service provider would lead to an increase in competition, a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for us to enter such a competition?
When the service providers have something important, they can cooperate, they can also testify around the birth of U:fon.
The greatest pressure on the ČTÜ is likely to be difficult about the birth of the T-Mobile company's U:fon.
This can be seen from the website of the ČTÜ.
But right now, the U:fond comes as a good argument why we should not allow the entrance of the virtual service provider.
Martina Kemrova added: "The environment of competition in the mobile market has recently been affected by access to the fourth mobile market.
Given the nature of the Czech mobile market, it is obvious that the entry of a new player on the market and its services would be subject to high requirements."
However, given the attitude of mobile operators, the total lack of interest of Czech regulators is quite amazing.
In the meantime, it is not only about the Czech Republic's attitude, which is unfortunately, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, that has no right to intervene in economic competition.
Only the Economic Competition Office is entitled to do so.
But the office is in a way that is closely related to the whole problem.
"The move towards a virtual service provider's mobile market would only be possible if the contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider were concluded on the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, since the supply of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for traditional service providers," she mentioned in our question about Kristian Chlapua, the External Relations Department of the Economic Competition Office.
A statement from service providers' representatives, as such, would probably not surprise anyone.
However, the agency that should represent the interests of consumers and ensure, in addition to others, that no one can return to their market situation is more than strange.
In particular, if Kristian Chalica adds: "In a country where virtual service providers generally work, we can observe that their move to the market has contributed to reducing the price of mobile phone services."
However, the interests of UOHS are probably not covered by pressure to correct the functioning of the market environment and to reduce prices.
In the case, there is indeed a shocking consistency from the reaction of the three mobile service providers.
The question is whether it really is just a coincidence is almost self-evident.
As in the charging stations, completely identical gas prices are only works of chance and tough competition.
"In this case, the Office did not discover the signs of anticompetitive proceedings, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the service providers have a leading position, i.e. they do not have more responsibility in proportion to their market circumstances.
The instruments needed to open the mobile market of virtual service providers are probably missing also for the telecommunications regulator," Chalica said.
The presentation of a leading market situation is one of the many points of discussion.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÜ, which shows that telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, there is no Czech service provider in a leading position.
However, some legal experts also offer a different approach - the approval of the network operator is always necessary for the establishment of a virtual service provider.
And the mobile operator - relatively logical - has a monopoly on his own network.
So he's dominant in a certain segment.
However, even if we did not accept this argument, UOHS should be at least agitated to act like three mobile operators.
In parallel, complaints by interested parties (including the GTS Novera company mentioned above) show that there are very similar obstacles in the negotiation process of all service providers.
In addition, the transfer of responsibility to ČTÜ is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which UOHS takes its hands off the whole case.
We've already met in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, the extension of the powers of the Czech Republic in the field of economic competition was not possible in the telecommunications sector, although many experts hoped to improve this situation.
This is what the representatives of UOHS need to know well, but it is likely that others are in their interests.
It works when no one's watching.
In the meantime, there will be an unnoticed operation of some kind of virtual service provider, many of which already operate in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that issue their own mobile service price lists, but which are only partially public.
Because it's multi-level marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bochemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the chosen ones.
The magic is that the company acts as a classic corporate client against the service provider, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an adult client, you will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that all Czech mobile service providers are prohibited from making similar representations.
"If there were cases that would be discussed, the terms of the contract could be an infringement to which we would be dealing and which could lead to the end of the cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrova answered our question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that the news about this kind of activity would not have reached the responsible people of mobile operators.
In particular, for the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
In the meantime, no service provider shall defend itself against such a procedure.
Because of the activities of these companies, they have no negligible profit and, unlike the real virtual service providers, they are not particularly threatened with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, but it only uses the services of these companies as a negligible percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card is not listed on their phones, so that it does not have full access to it as a general customer of mobile operators."
But at least that's what the S.H.I.E.L.D. should be weird.
In addition, another question arises for UOHS.
If the mobile service providers face similar procedures, why prevent the birth of the virtual service provider?
It should be added that UOHS has relatively strong rights to detect such activities and that, if it does not want to, it does not need to be satisfied with the explanations of service providers that nothing has been done and that commercial terms prohibit this.
When we're not the most expensive
As has been said some times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has led to a marked drop in prices of services.
In the meantime, virtually all countries where virtual service providers are established have tried to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small, perhaps too satisfied, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, regulatory bodies have intervened at these very moments, which have protected the interests of not mobile operators but their customers.
It was then either by formal measures or by informal pressure that the first virtual service provider that others were following was established.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are giving each other the whole case.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that they are well equipped with unsolved competences in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If background information is good and the virtual service provider is really coming to our house soon, the Czech mobile market may re-launch again.
If one of the providers would allow the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, UOHS would be difficult to remain indifferent to the rejection of additional interested parties (discrimination).
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may not be making any more expensive calls.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech state hymnnus.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Miek Topolá presented the new admissions of the state hymns on the day of the Czech State.
The hymnust was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlavek.
There are four versions - male or female solos, singer or instrumentically.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The authors of the amendment of the hymnus Otakar Jeremiás and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz website.
Bělohlavek sees the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has already told us that he has deliberately selected young representative singers who are expressive and popular to sing the variety.
"Although from the beginning, I tried to take care of both of them, and later at the orchestra I was trying to take care of the pure diction, the good clarity and consistency of the text," he said.
The Czech state himnus celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Where I am home?" was first recorded at the Rendi Theatre in 1834 by Josef Kajetan Tyl Fidlovačka, in addition to the music by František Skroup.
He became popular, and people looked spontaneously at him as their own.
The first verse of the song has become a natural part of the state hymnus after Czechoslovakia was formed in 1918.
After the formation of the Czech Republic, seven state symbols remained.
What a "new" hymnus
On Wednesday, Prague transport company will be first delivered by chip card
October 1st, 2008 describes you as the date in the history of the Prague Transport Company when you enter metros, electrics and buses the first passenger to have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper liner.
The coupon is currently available for about 100 thousand people with the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy 30 days and 90 days and annual coupons (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time go to their chip card in the information centres and offices of the Transport Company at Muzeum, Mïstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajska zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
The coupons have already been available on the Internet since yesterday via www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until afternoon hours.
Those who start using online commerce can permanently forget the publishing windows of metro stations, where long lines have so far been held for the lines.
The coupon can be bought via the Internet and saved to the Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers have a remote with trained servers who help interested in buying the Internet and save their purchased coupons for their cards," Martin Opatrný said the spokesperson of the project.
In addition to the libraries, electronic coupons can be saved to Opencard in the self-service automation machines installed in some of the halls.
How do these machines look?
Pirosak, reminds of ticket managers, and the passengers may already have noticed them at Roztyly, Budějovicka, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavska metro stations.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but it should be eighty by the end of the year," added Opatrný.
The coupon will check the driver instead of the car.
Their operation is simple for handling machines that start tomorrow.
All you have to do is set up the Opencard chip card and the coupon you paid earlier will be gone by itself.
From tomorrow, electronic coupons are valid not only in the capital, but also around the city.
So on trains and bus lines around the city, from 300 to 499, the residents of Central-Czech travel to the capital.
"On trains classified in the Prague integrated transport, the fishermen have been brought with card readers to determine the zone integrity of the coupons," explained the control of the lines from Ropid's organization, which brings together the agenda for public transport in Prague.
In the busses around the city, card readers are equipped with the driver's wallet.
Thus, when entering, the driver should not only show the chip card, but also opencard should be placed in a specified location on the cash register side.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the coupons.
"If, for example, the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, it is the easiest thing to ask the driver to do so," Drapal added.
Passengers who do not travel by bus around the city and will not remember when their coupon expires may again go to the self-service machines that saves coupons.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the device.
The Sudets wanted a referendum from the U.S.
In 1945, the Sudanese Germans asked for the addition of Šumava to the United States.
This is evident from the letter in the collection of the Scientific Library in South Chechnya.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the United States of America's patronate.
This was said to have been desired in 1945 by a group of Germans from Sudan to the President of the United States.
This is also reflected in a letter from a private archive held today in the collection of the Scientific Library in South Chechnya.
The Germans in Česky Krumlov are asking the President of the United States not to allow the return of the "Shumuvai county" to the Czech Republic, which was still taken by Hitler under the Munich Treaty.
"We understood the situation correctly, and we really want to be sure of those words that the American troops will come to the German territories in no way as a repression and enemy, but as a liberator," is in the letter, "Members, who bear the fate of Shamava in their hearts".
Since the annexation to Czechoslovakia is claimed to be the Germans of Sudan, in addition to the knowledge of the Czech national character - can only hope for brutality, mercy, not understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the President of the United States to take over Šumava 'now and forever'.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of its four million inhabitants' opinions, this area would be considered an alien country for us, which will suppress and overthrow the minority and almost nothing will contribute to the victory of allies," he says in the letter.
The reason the authors could not sign is that fear of the revenge of the "Czech Depressors".
Therefore, if the President of the United States were supposed to doubt the Germans' opinion, it would be enough to hold a referendum on whether its inhabitants wish to become part of the United States and to live during the United States' piracy.
Although the text of the letter may seem a bit naive in the current knowledge of postwar history, some historians believe that it is appropriate to illustrate the expectations of the former Germans in Sudan.
Even if the Czech Germans had to think that they would be deported from the country, only a few of them would recognise this possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would agree on a form of autonomy for the Sudetians.
Others again trusted that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalica, Austrian journalist born in České Budějovic.
Chalica served as a German at the Navy during the war in the Baltic Sea.
When, at the end of the war, the British captured him and put him in a prison camp in Holštynskó, several dozen other Czech Germans came to teach him how to do it.
"They trusted that if they would return, the Czech language would be good for them," Chalica said.
According to one of the German prisoners in Czechoslovakia before the war, no one was expecting to be removed from the country on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
You're not thinking - you're paying!
The emotional campaign attacks leaders
In Czech history, the most expensive operation for road safety.
The media campaign on emotions that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday would also be characterised.
Aleš êebíček's office from this campaign hopes that he will discourage the leaders from the dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The campaign for 150 million will be on television, radio, cinema, internet, but will also be published on flyers.
Leaders should be alarmed by fast drive and alcohol.
And you should remind them to stick their seatbelts in before they leave.
In particular, young drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians, and not least professional leaders want to express their conscience.
And what appears in the ads?
Emotion attack, primarily human stories.
The whole campaign's "bloody" blog also testifies this:
You're not thinking - you're paying!
The term "no thinking" on the license plate is written in large letters.
And in the bloodthirsty, the word "pays."
This must show that you can pay for a moment’s attention with your life.
The viewers are "creating" up until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the UK countries, where dramatic images of victims of accidents can be seen regularly.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertising sites were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Pull it, hit the drivers.
"Hold on drivers, let's get his system straight.
"Let them have it" is, for example, when they pass through the red, thus saving time.
Pull the penalty or accident risk.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, a transport psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need the information campaign in the press, especially the negative campaign, the psychologist thinks.
He thinks that the driver's attention is less effective than any sign of danger.
"If the hazard warning board is fitted, it is likely that the environment will be aligned soon and the leaders will not deal with it," warned Kořán.
He'd give back almost all the occupied areas for peace
Ehud Olmer, President of the provisional Israeli government, spoke about the return of virtually all areas in 1967, namely the west coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan-fensík, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
That's what he said in an interview that he published on Monday at Jediot Achron daily.
"We have to agree with Palestinians, which means that almost all, if we don't give back all of the areas that were occupied," Olmer told the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but the Palestinians have to give us a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that the possible return included East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, wants to keep tractors and bulldozers from going through his feet, as one of my best friends did, must give up part of Jerusalem," said Olmert, referring to two July attacks in which some people were killed and a few dozen were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution for the Church Mountain, Holy and Historical Places in Old Town.
"The one who wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he stressed.
Excavation of the Golanfensík
Olmer also gave an opinion on the withdrawal of the Israelis from the Golan-fennsík, which, in his view, is an essential condition for the peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would require a certain effort from Damascus.
"I'm not suggesting a peace bond with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," warned.
"The Syrians well know what they have to give up so they can get Golan.
They have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Site movement); they have to give up the regular support provided by the Prime Minister for the terrorism of Hamas (Site movement), Al-Qaida and Jihad (holy war) in Iraq," he explained.
Questions after the accident: Is it illegal to escort passengers in the buses?
The law doesn't know them. You can't walk in a van.
Regarding the tragic bus accident of Student Agency, near the Italian Padova, the question arises whether passengers and passengers can travel in the bus while travelling.
"If we are to comply strictly and formally with the law, its accompanying activities are incompatible with the law on transport activities," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, the death of a twenty-two-year-old passenger escort was probably caused by the driver of a truck that crosses the bus road.
The girl was sitting next to the driver at that moment, even though two more seats were included in the bus's least safe place.
The bus may crash or suddenly stop even when it serves passenger coffee or offers a newspaper.
He's in charge of whether the bus has its seat according to the traffic license.
If the bus is not homologized, passengers must sit.
The Student Agency buses do not have their seats; they are confirmed by the Director of the Company, Radim Jančura, Aktuálně.cz.
"We tried to find a solution to this Ministry, and at first passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this has been withdrawn and we have come to the conclusion that passengers can go to toilets during the journey if they have their own seats," he said.
The law doesn't know the passenger escort
"There is no clear legal pressure on the role of passenger attendants - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the provision of services to the carrier.
The Road Traffic Act only recognises the concept of a vehicle attendant; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds a less clearly Hanzelka speaker.
On the contrary, Mr Pokorný, Director of the Road Transport Department of the Ministry of Transport, considers the problem properly addressed by the law.
"It depends on whether the bus is in the traffic license.
And it's over," she says.
Buses can be discriminated against by cities with standing and restricted maximum speed and city-to-city positions and allowed higher speeds and seats without remote positions and with the maximum allowed speed, seat with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says the expert.
Jaroslav Hořín, BESIP's safety expert in the movement of passengers on board the bus does not see a fundamental problem.
"In the course of continued progress, there is not much danger, we can compare the situation to the service on the plane.
I'm not even sure when there's a security and an air carrier can hit his head."
"But if the bus were to stop suddenly, of course its physical laws apply.
Same as in city buses or electrics.
Passengers' safety should be solved by internal rules," says and believes that the problem has not been resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to remove services
Student Agency offers passenger accompanying services as a single bus carrier.
I work for 200 passengers.
After the accident, the director does not consider their occupation to be risky.
"But I'm going to have the impression that passenger assistants' profession is risky, and I'm going to put them out.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers at the entrance.
It would also be cost savings," says.
In its operations, Alexej Litvin, director of Asiana, explained for safety reasons the lack of passengers, who operated the fractions of flights compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have passengers, we're against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it ends with some kind of fatal injury," said Týden, barely a year ago.
There was an incredible tragedy.
The company was killed by a young passenger in Plzeň, who worked for two years during a journey in Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned off the track without using the direction indicator and stopped the bus path.
The driver of the bus was suddenly trying to get out with a manoeuvring, but the right front part of the bus got hit.
The fact that two reserved places to relax passengers were also sold is rejected by Jančura.
"There's no way to book these seats at long distances, blocked."
The company wants to sue the truck manager.
With the compensation of the daughter's family, the agency is not waiting for the court's judgment, but the financial compensation is also expected by the victim.
Amendment of law?
In the distant future
The clarification of the movement of passenger attendants on board the bus could be an amendment to the law on which the Department of Transport has been working for more than a year as a 30-minute expert group.
"The group, however, has not achieved any concrete results.
The buses are not so, they are more concerned with the point system on the highway with maximum allowed speed and mobile use during driving," says Hořín, expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard the activities of passengers' escorts as being a fundamental threat to passenger safety", says Hanzelka, spokesperson, saying that the security of buses is subject to police and labour offices.
The hope of dyseldorf in Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB board to the bank's employees is not narrowing down in the big words.
From the merger between the unit of the dysseldorf financial institution and Deka-Bank in Frankfurt, "the central capital market organisation of the savings fund group" could be established - the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a long-lasting "competition block" into a store like this.
Such a relationship could give a decisive boost to further interconnections in the province banking sector.
This is the reading of a board that wishes to prove its capacity in difficult times.
In fact, there is still great pressure on WestLB's uncertain position.
Not only did the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Authority, which recently announced with the Northern Ractphalia province government that the deadline for finding a lasting solution is limited.
However, for savings bank clients between Deka-Bank and WestLB, the topic of a kind of relationship is also a French part.
Franz Waas, Head of Deka-Bank, already at the end of August, announced that the half-year data were presented to Mainzer Landstraße and a province bank such as Helaba or WestLB's merger.
Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of Deka, which represents one half of the Land Banks, and half of them are representatives of the savings bank associations, has entrusted the board to continue negotiations with WestLB on common business activities.
In this context, capital market business or some parts of it may be discussed.
The negotiations, however, call for financial circles - have just begun.
The name of Deka-Bank, one of the major employers of the French financial sector, does not first arise in the consolidation of the savings fund sector.
In 2003, Deka-Bank seemed to be united with Landesbank Rheinland and Helaba.
However, there was nothing about this triunity.
The plans were barely publicised, the government of the provinces spoke against Helaba's interest.
After that, the other two banks couldn't find each other.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead went to Stuttgart Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
However, the idea of the relationship between Deka-Bank and the Landesbanks has been re-created.
Last time, however, Günther Merl, President of Helaba, spoke against the plans for mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, it is worth recognising that there is a need for a closer approach to the various banks of the inter-sector.
Now, the relationship between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected to be the first to take place following the elections in the Province Assembly in Bajoran.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If pressure for further mergers is increased, potential partners can slowly run out.
In southern Germany, only a younger partner would be, when the financial crisis has so far been significantly better overcome than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
And the merger with WestLB was excluded at the beginning of the year by Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, with 85% of its business space in Helaba.
The NordLB will stay right.
However, such geostrategic considerations represent only one side of the coin.
On the other side, the question arises how different business models apply to each other.
Merl stated in June that the German savings bank and the jury have not yet answered the crucial question of what business model should be provided for the future of the Landesbanks.
Finally, there is still a possibility of cutting the WestLB, but they do not want it there by themselves.
Thus, the letter of the Board of Directors also states that they are certainly seeking a 'full solution'.
How this can be agreed with the merger of individual units with Deka-Ban is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "Olas weekend"
For Elena, this is the first time I've ever had, the third or fourth time for Luca.
But now Elena's here as her girlfriend, and so everything's different, says Luca.
Behind them, Kaiser has a five-litre barrel with a strong body-catering beard, and it proves to be about 200 persons traveling to Oktoberfest that he can draw deep voices out of his throat.
Elena first found Luca's face, then she kisses him.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, four buses from the bus station next to the Puorta Nuova train station depart at 23.45 o'clock "destinazione Monaco, paint della information" with a view to arrival at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly held for Italians, only for Brazilians in the fourth.
At one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans were already singing along with their flags, and the celebration began during the night.
And so loudly, that's not for the Italians - says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, wearing a long, artificial-sleeve coat and a wide silver-sleeved glasses.
He's been traveling for five years to Oktoberfest, only three trips this year.
At night, during the day, Oktoberfesten, home at 22:30.
The accommodation would be just an unnecessary expense, says Marco.
The journey costs EUR 75, this includes a German language course in Marco Frankfurt, which is a welcome beer cooked in accordance with the Bajoran beer law, accident insurance and German-language tourism.
And they're already taking the buses into the night on the highway to "Brennero."
No beer, not yet.
The bus will be quiet soon, the passengers will sleep.
All right, that's how they're gonna need their strength.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, a holiday is held, where several Italian buses will take a short break before Munich on motorway 8.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half a week, there are almost 50 other buses arriving throughout Europe.
Elena, Luca, and the others are gathering, Marco's taking one last bulletin, presenting the plan of war.
First, everybody pick up the yellow hat.
The letter "Oktoberfest", written on the left, is available, alongside him, on the internet address of Marco's travel office: "Conoscersiviagiando.it".
Second, "When the brewer's gates open, run," Marco calls it in the morning.
"Futás!" is booked in the back of the run and in the back of the tent.
"It's not forward, because we're stuck, and don't sit on the same pads every yellow hat, let's spread out in the tent."
The unicorn is worth € 8.25, screams Marco.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards they're doing well.
As soon as you leave your seats, they'll take care of them."
Third, "This evening, at 6:30, you'll be back here!" You understand?
And we're on our way to Wiesn.
On the way, one man binds yellow hats on trees, boards, and even one of the big Bajoran folkboards.
We need to prepare for withdrawal.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as "Olas weekend".
There are no exact figures; 50,000 people who are going through Alpokon in the beer tents are reported to be 10 percent of all visitors of the weekend from Italy.
Seven South Tirole policemen confirm the Munich Police, Italian volunteers assist the Bajoran Red Cross, which, in national statistics about 200 medical services, includes the Italians in the first place, preventing the Austrians (about 80) and the British (about 60).
Among the Italians, Hofbräu was particularly popular.
Unfortunate nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, emphasised by Mr Peer Steinbrück Federal Finance Minister only last week.
Even luck is that the politician used the word "relatively" and in his words, even said that the German banking sector did not spare crisis-like developments.
Because this weekend was the end of it.
Daxon’s listed Müncheni Hypo Real Estate (HRE) has received billions of loans from the German banks’ consortium to protect itself from market security.
One person who knows the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan subsidies will be €35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate must pay interest only after the part used.
The money is partly from private and partly public banks.
In the background, Depfa's subsidiary is losses.
According to a press release, Depfa conducting public funds lends money to long-term projects and re-finances itself for a very short period of time, which is now not possible due to the uncertainty on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash debt decreased by 95 % to EUR 2,37 million and its equity share decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1,45%.
The current revenue and net revenue from cash transactions returned to zero from the same period of the previous year, falling back to EUR 5 million by more than 70 per cent from the credit claims credits and fixed securities and the disposal of the credit transfer’s target reserves.
Only due to higher revenues resulting from the reimbursement of the ex-recital accounting costs of the conversion of the former Depfa group and the reimbursement of interest on the levy and the reduced revenue deficit on the round by 16 % for the companies belonging to the group.
After the privatisation in 1990, the former state finance company was first speculating corporate real estate loans, which were later separated from Aeral Bank.
As the classic state funding was limited, Depfa has more strongly included in infrastructure projects and in joint projects between private investors and the state (prive-public partnership, PPP), and has expanded its activities internationally.
The value of the subsidiaries must now be described by Hypo Real Estate which has a "substantial effect" to show the results of the group in a fairly general way.
The fact is, we didn't pay the dividends.
The dividend has already been reduced to one third by 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure fan since Depfa was received.
In contrast to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on the refinancing of the interbank market as it does not have any credit deposits.
With the collapse of the US Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, bank lending was over, as banks keep their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets to refinance part of the Deffa credit portfolio - some EUR 50 billion per year.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered by the loan for a period of time and the company's protected "from the influence of today's largely inoperable international financial markets."
According to other sources, refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Mr Funke, President of HRE’s Board of Directors, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets for a limited period of time.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Service (BaFin) consider that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now being guaranteed.
It gives shareholders and creditors hope.
But because of the dynamics and inestimability of the crisis, certain people cannot be involved.
It is not even possible to fully exploit funding.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the news of the late Saturday evening, the bank was still at the edge of the bankruptcy, it was not possible to calm down the fields even if it was temporary.
The share price decreased by 75 % to EUR 3,30.
On the other hand, the bond rates are pretty good.
While debt under first place is barely changing, the exchange rates of subordinated bonds are significantly reduced.
In particular, the crisis affects the previous subsidiary, Württemberg Hypo bonds and, in a way, the futures of the year beyond 2009.
While the Hypo Real Estate bonds seemed to be an investment alternative in the past, their value stability is now to be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system, and as a result of the financial crisis being taken almost into the house by Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less risk business banks are ready to support the system, the cancellation of the benefits may take place on the deadline.
Or it will happen, in which almost everyone currently hopes that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, reports related to partial nationalisation have shown that the likelihood of certainty is now justifiable.
For long-term creditors, it can cause sleepless nights to decide whether or not to get rid of their investment.
Short-term investors may nevertheless use sales to reserve taxes on exchange rates for the years to come.
The secrets of Sylvana and the inside boxes
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to be introduced to Tachibana High School on his first day of teaching, the girls are going to be whistling: The German girl is totally "like"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word about mangaes in the new exchange students blog about Japan.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I was so excited.
I was on my way to school.
I live at the edge of Tokyo, towards Plank, and I travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, luckily I wasn't wrong.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tajikistan is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students start to rush in at eight o'clock, while at 8 o'clock, a short conversation starts with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the teaching began, I had the line to introduce myself.
But I'm not the type to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had my school uniform yet, my maid was wearing an old skirt, she was wearing a shirt, blue knee jacket, and black leather shoes.
So I've been in this dress before the cathedral, and I've tried to say everything correctly: "Sjonara, vo nor Sylvana ..." - they call me Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and I'm gonna be my birthday in a week.
At this moment, I was very happy that I started learning the language for two years.
All 31 girls were whispering, whining, and waving, and I kept hearing the word "heavy."
I've known this from my manga.
It belongs to Japanese girls, and it means "cuki, sweet."
Then I got in my place quickly.
The girl next to me smiled wide, felt it was an honor to put her next to the exchange school.
The rest of the clock was pretty calm, but when the bell was voiced, they ran off on a regular basis.
Everyone talked and laughed at me, and they put a hole in my belly with questions - and it's quite difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
At the break, everyone packed his insides.
My guest viewer made me a lunch like this - it's completely different from the boring German ten-hour sandwiches.
I got spice rice, little sausages, salads made of cucumbers and alkaloids, fruit and a kind of tofu meat.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Foods look strange and taste completely new.
It's a fact that everything's really good.
Well, yeah, except for the salty silage, brrrr.
In Japanese schools, the inside isn't just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy her own hand-made ben, which she particularly produces from artists, in the hope that she can get to know the boy more closely during the lunch break.
I read about this in my manga comic books.
I wonder if I can observe this here.
"Why is Japan?" - My friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
'Cause he's just charming me.
After all, I've been reading bats for years.
And to understand the comic books and the culture they described in them better, I started learning Japanese sometimes.
It was clear to me, then, that I had to travel here sometime.
Since I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And they're very high in here.
Japan, on the one hand, is the country of the latest techniques and trends - and on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything was organized so well, I've never felt lost, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats have emotions, too.
A rat or a moly in case of danger, does that mean he feels scared?
Joseph LeDoux, a neurologist, is convinced that animals have emotions.
But how can we examine whether they feel the same way when they behave like us?
In the "Edge" Internet magazine, famous scientists have been publishing their articles for years.
The SPIEGEL ONLINE in one of the series "What is true without being able to prove it?" asks the answers to the question.
I believe that animals have emotions and other state of mind without being able to prove that to me or to anyone else so far.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of each human brain is the same.
However, as we examine other species, and in general, we are breaking the questions of consciousness, making it difficult to walk because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: He pretends himself dead, running or attacking.
People behave in a similar way, and some researchers conclude comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult for us to take over our own subjective experiences.
On the one hand, human consciousness-related circuits almost always include the lateral pre-frontal brain cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and implementation/control functions).
This wide area is more developed for humans than for other mammals, and it seems that there is a complete lack of other living beings.
At least, our awareness of the aspects of the pre-frontal cortex, such as knowing who we are or, in the case of design and decision-making, can reasonably be expected to differ from other breasts.
An additional dramatic characteristic is found in the language of man: Because of the fact that a significant part of human experience is related to the language, it is often said that it depends on the mind.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
However, even if it did not depend on the language, the language would certainly influence it, so animal consciousness, whatever it is, is likely to be very different from most of our state of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness can be like for other animals.
If the mind is not measured as an internal and subjective matter, and because of the special hardware, it is not possible to analyze it on the basis of our own experience, then your research will cause us to face serious problems.
Most of my ideas relate to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of knowledge that is likely to be more accessible to science.
It would be possible to examine animal consciousness processes without a doubt, and that is exactly what happens in the case of experiments on the short-term memory of the primates, particularly in the example of visualisation.
However, the assumption that Christof Koch and Francis Crick had examined is based more on the nervous relationship of consciousness than on the visual mechanisms: both can be the same or not.
Interestingly, this assumption highlights the importance of pre-frontal cortex in creating visualization.
What is the result of this emotion?
I recall that an emotional system, as a fear, is activated in a brain known to its own activity.
What we call fear is therefore the mental state in which we are when the activity (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) of the protection system in the brain takes a working memory.
Thus, the emotions are closely linked to the areas of the cortex of the brain that are characteristic of the primates, especially humans.
In addition to the linguistic nature, perception is divided into subtle levels because with words and language, we are able to distinguish and categorise situations for others along our own lines.
For example, Antonio Damasio is of the opinion that emotions come from simpler activities of the brain cortex and the brain-scared body sensitisation areas, as well as Jaak Pankseep, who instead concentrate on the brain-scaring.
Since this network has not changed very well in human evolution, it can easily play a part in comprehensive emotions of species.
I can't deny that, but I don't think it's proved.
The Bank considers that what appears to be a fear in rats and humans is likely to be felt in both cases: How can rats and humans feel the same way when they behave like them?
A cockroach escapes in the event of danger, does he feel fear?
In my opinion, only similar behavior is not evidence of the same experience yet.
Although neural comparison continues to help us: rats and humans are like brain-broken, but the roaches have no brain.
But the brain-breaker is responsible for emotions?
And even if this can be proven for humans, how can we prove this to the rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
However, I don't know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are apparently essentially different from ours (based on special currents of human consciousness and language), I am looking for the emotional behaviour of rats rather than emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area has been shown at the neurological level if the rats and humans measure the same thing.
As for rats, I do not seek language and consciousness, nor do I know emotions, because I don't know if they exist.
For others, this may seem like a short-sighted attitude, but I'd rather go ahead than keep my eye on the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of UEFA: Time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Mr Vaszjunik, Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, said that preparations would shortly be subject to the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees confidence in Ukraine in the decision of UEFA Bordeaux and the evidence that they believe that Ukraine is able to organise the European Championship together with Poland", said Vasjunik.
"This, however, does not represent an amnestia for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still much to be done in both countries."
With regard to the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both guest countries are missing.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We need to work with a scoundrel right now," said Grigorij Surkis, President of the Ukrainian Labda Association.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us all the time."
In Poland, you've been set up for a more radical step.
Following several scandals, the National Olympic Commission suspended the management of the Polish PZPN Association, which was replaced by Commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the initiative of Minister for Sports of Miroslaw Drzewieck.
There's a danger of PZPN being unable to operate according to the rules, said Drzewiecki to the Polish PAP news agency.
"In addition, we assured Michel Platinum, President of UEFA, that this will not adversely affect the preparation of the 2012 EIB."
Only in the past season, because of the manipulation of several first leagues, had to be classified into the lower class, and eventually the league tar had to be postponed.
The desolated Dennis Quaid is going back
The actress would have wanted to advertise a new film, talked about her private life in her interview, and now she's in trouble with her ex-husband, and Ryan hollywood's star recognized her former husband, Dennis Quad.
The one who's on strike - and it's coming back.
The late rose war at the ex-wives of Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid: The two actors in Hollywood spent seven years fighting each other after their divorce - before the public.
And Ryan in an interview with the American InStyle magazine last week, he first said about the causes of divorce: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, which has caused a lot of pain."
And only after the divorce, he found out that Dennis cheated on several women.
The spiritual stripper was due to his new press work on Ryan's "Women" film, which describes the history of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid was determined to say to a unfaithful husband, "The 54-year-old actor said to the New York Daily News, "that Meg is bored and he repeats the story of our relationship."
And it's also "sorry" that 16-year-old joint boys, Jack, repeating "seriously reminded of all the pain and change that divorce causes to a child."
While Ryan has been living alone since his divorce, Quaid has been married again and recently became the father of a twin.
That's why his answer to the next page is closed: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is best."
Flights and hotel rooms are falling
In the first half of 2008, European airways and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to an actual study, flights in Germany were less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of airways and hotel rooms were again more favourable - so it can be summed up as a result of one of American Express travel and financial services.
The company analysed its first half of 2008 booking data and found a significant price drop in the second quarter after the first quarter price increase.
After the price rise in the hotel market for years, the accommodation has become much cheaper.
Between January and March, prices increased on average by 6.9 per cent in 41 of the 48 European cities examined compared to 2007.
However, prices were already 3,6 % lower in the period from April to June than in the previous year.
This trend was most clearly shown in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than one year earlier.
For this reason, American Express sees it at the low rate of the dollar, which led to the "flying of American tourists".
The fall in hotel room prices affects financial centres such as Frankfurt or London as industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
The 26.3% rise in hotel prices in Norway is a European record.
There was also an increasing trend towards price changes in the first quarter.
Due to the shrinkage of kerosine, passengers had to pay by an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, while long-term airways requiring high fuel cost 29.2 per cent.
Between April and June, the prices of class flights decreased by 12.5 per cent on average compared to the previous quarter, but the prices in business and first class showed only a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9%, decreased by 23.6% in the second quarter.
According to the study, the prices of domestic flights in Germany decreased half.
The reason for the drop in prices is, on the one hand, due to the moderate economic growth, the company claims.
In many segments of the aviation market, demand has weakened.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement liberalising air travel between the US and Europe strengthens the pressure on the competitive situation.
This has been demonstrated by the fact that airlines are breaking their lost flights, and several airlines reported bankruptcy during the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV hits Gladbach at 1-0.
The Hamburger SV was put on the table with a goal and simple method.
In Borussia, Luhukay still has no chance of a working team.
Kristoffer Klein magnification Deep flying for national selected Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player was only late in the game and his raise came back from the hood.
His precise message left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," she said Hermann Rieger in the corridor leading to the Hamburg arena cabins.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break ended, and most of them were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger had his HSV physical therapist for almost three decades, he enjoyed greater authority than a few hairball players.
So he found his request for a hearing at the competent place.
Cornelius Jol's assistant was bloating, and he's agreed to show up his thumb.
Cornelius is Martin Jol's brother, the director of Hamburg.
His orders could be like that: Here with the second goal!
The execution of the order has not been completed.
"Today was not always nice to see" – she later admitted Marcel Jansen.
Bastian Reinhardt was "a lot easier to imagine" about it.
1: 0 (1: 0) gives rise to the result of Mladen Petric head of Hamburg (11.) and the condition that the very weak Gladbachians could not cause pain to the weak hamburgers.
"It was a fair win" - Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV will be 121 on Monday.
The audiences had already celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the table on the projector, which represented their team as the top of the championship.
It's a birthday without a party.
"We know where to put it" said Marcel Jansen.
It assumes that the interim certificate of the table indicates the unpredictableness of the league rather than the domain of the HSV.
Although the team will find itself slowly, thanks to its late-consented works, thanks to the Brasian Neves and Silva, the narrow Petrics and Jansen from FC Bayern.
"We need more sense and chatter," Jol insisted.
After decontamination
Wall Street is in fear.
With the first news of the failure of the rescue package, Dow Jones temporarily dropped 700 points.
It was the biggest point loss in the history of one day.
Later Dow was strengthened.
At 20:30, the world’s most important stock exchange barometers were good at 5 percent minus and stood at 10.579 points.
The trader Nasdaq, with technology papers, fell to 1548 points with more than seven percent minus.
At this moment, the biggest loser in Dow was American Express with 14% loss, followed by the Bank of America 12 percent.
No paper was reinforced.
The goldman Sachs bank's shares have fallen nearly 10 percent.
Only a few days earlier, the bank purchased a share of Warren Buffett's large investor.
The rescue mission is intended to provide resources for the purchase of so-called dual mortgage securities.
However, the amount is not paid at the same time but gradually.
In addition, the State would be receiving financial institutions’ share options, which could be settled in the event of appropriate exchange rate developments, reducing the burden on the state bank.
European and American prices and share prices at break-off
The billions of aid granted to European and US banks do not dispel the doubts of investors.
Hypo Real Estate German large bank stock prices fall and grabs Dax with you.
The American Dow Jones indicator is falling despite the state-designed rescue of the money market.
The spectacular price losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank were deep in the negatives of the German share indicator (Dax).
In spite of the rescue of the federal government and private banks, the real estate shareholder in Munich fell to its quarter, the Commerzbank weakened by more than 20 percent.
Dax is psychologically important below 6,000 exact limits, and it recorded 5839 points at the 3,7 percent minus.
Stock markets have been forced to kneel around the world.
Wall Street opened in New York with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion rescue package will not be enough to boost the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trade, i.e. 3,3 per cent falling to 10.809,25.
The American Parliament wished to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate vote could take place on 1 October.
Other European exchanges also know only one direction: London's FTSE indicator showed 3.2 percent weakening, and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index was down to 11.743,61 points after its initial increase.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dropped to 18.286,90 points by 2.1 percent.
The Indian Sensex indicator lost 506,43 points, which is 3,9 percent, and closed at 12.595,75 points.
At the Mdax stock exchange, Arcandor’s shares weakened after the announcement of the increase in capital.
Sal. Oppenheimer's private bank recorded 23 million new shares.
In the commercial and tourist groups, Thomas Cook also reported that the shares are not sold.
Dark material affects the flight of space probes
A mysterious phenomenon has led to misconceptions among researchers for years. Dark material affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity cannot be fully correct.
"Ulysses" space probe flew for almost 18 years in space.
The soon-frozen fuel pipelines threaten the icefish.
A mysterious phenomenon, a swing-by anomaly, has been a mess among scientists for years.
Swing-by is the gravitational price of space probes, which provides additional impetus to a heavenly body, such as Earth's gravitational space.
So probes can save large quantities of fuel.
The European American Cassini-Huygens explorer also used this physical trick as well.
But what has been admiring researchers for years is that flying objects do not behave fully as if they were expected under the ancient gravitational law.
Instead, abnormalities occur at speed.
The probes suddenly speed up or slow down.
The physics have not been able to explain this effect until now.
The phenomenon was crucified to swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity cannot be entirely correct, which makes the material’s mass release as a curve of space.
Stephen Adler's American physics, the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to believe that Einstein was not mistaken, and the swing-by anomaly is trying to explain with the so-called dark material the astronauts discovered in the universe.
"The anomaly can be responsible for the dark matter that may be found even near the Earth," says Adler.
Space scientists have only been aware of the existence of the dark material for ten years.
Obviously, gravitational force has been developed that has a noticeable effect on other heavenly bodies.
The material itself, however, is totally invisible, i.e. electromagnetic radiation of any kind, does not specifically produce visible light or beat back.
Scientists calculate that the total mass of the universe is a good one of the dark material.
The tourists who were kidnapped in Egypt were released.
After ten days in their capture, the tourists in Egypt were once again free - confirmed by the Italian Secretary of State.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded millions of euros of ransom fees.
In the shooting before the hostages were released, six hostages claimed to have lost their lives.
Five German citizens were kidnapped in South Egypt.
The negotiations on the ransom are already underway.
Again and again Germans will be the target of kidnappings.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists in Sahara are free.
Egypt’s public television, Al-Arabija Arab TV and Italian media have also been reported.
According to Italian reports of Sky TG 24 television broadcasts, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of the release: "Our fellows and other hostages were released.
At the moment, we're investigating their health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians, and a Romanian citizen as well as eight Egyptian escorts are safe and sound - reported the Egyptian public television.
19 participants in the desert expedition are supposed to be on their way to Cairo.
The reason for the shooting before the hostages were released is still vague: According to a Egyptian security officer, the hostages have already shown their willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army killed them by surprise.
"The problem is solved.
They accepted the ransom," said the official.
"The trial was just about taking hostages," when the suddenly happened, "the surprise happened."
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers in the border areas between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and two were arrested.
The hostages demanded a ransom of EUR six million from Germany; the money should have been transferred to one of the hostage German wives.
The newspaper "al-Masri al-Jom", referring to a German intermediary, reported that the release of hostages is a long way away because the kidnappers are concerned about their own integrity.
According to the report, hostages release female hostages after paying the ransom.
Men are kept by kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
"It led to murder" is the violence in the steppe
In court, a woman committed suicide because her stepdad raped her for years.
He spent 57 years in prison in Stithians in Cornwall County, Hungary, following a statement of eight-line violent sex attempt.
The Trouroi Criminal Court learned that he was regularly committed to his stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, between the age of five and seven.
In a statement by Trerise, he wrote: "I feel remorse for his death."
At the trial, he said that he committed suicide at the age of 34 at his home in the town of Plymouth, Mutley, on 1 April 2007.
When she was a child in Coventry, Trerise tied her eyes and tied her eyes before the cohabitation, while her mother was working in a brewery.
Trerise left his wife in the 1980s and again chose Cornwall in his residence.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it turned out that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust Monument Service, was persecuted by the horrors of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, Officer Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who used to be passionately fond of surfing and cycling, said to her friends, "sensical dead" and "saying about life".
In April 2007, your father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle got involved with his daughter's stepdad, who finished her statement in letter, "I've always tied up and tied her eyes.
I wasn't sexually harassed.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely strange figure, and I'm sure this was terrible for his victim, especially if he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim killing himself.
But even more thoughtful is the fact that if you didn't, the case might never have been brought before a court."
The judge added: "I call attention to the effect Stephanie's parents have on their daughter over the years of the crime you've committed.
If it didn't happen, it would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman."
He was charged with losing the key data officer.
According to BBC's reports, the government official has been accused of a violation of his official secrets, who has given up strictly secret documents on a train in June.
The man's experts were posted from the Ministry of Defence when he left two strictly secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to BBC before they were transferred to the police.
This is the slightest charge of breaking the law, and there is no suspicion of deliberate action.
According to Frank Gardner, a journalist from the BBC Ministry of Defence, the move surprised a lot of people in Whitehall.
"They believed that the Ministry of Defence and the government would treat the case as an internal matter," he said.
An employee who cannot be named was charged under point 8.1 of the Act, this paragraph concerns the retention of information.
The State Prosecutor has proposed that the case against the officer be represented by the Metropolitan Police for the work of a rather sensitive nature concerning the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included secret surveys of Al-Qaida and the Iraqi army's capabilities.
He was informed on Monday about the decision and then moved to a place unknown from his home.
Homebuilding cooperatives pay B&amp;B account
UK housing cooperatives can count on more than 80 million english bills after the rescue of Bradford &amp; Bingley Bank.
The government spent 14 billion pounds protecting its deposits at Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of depositors, including 59 housing companies.
According to Adrian Coles, the president of the Homebuilding Association (BSA) says that companies and members must pay.
The 14 billion important loans will eventually be recovered after the repayment of Bradford &amp; Bingley mortgage loans.
However, in the meantime, the increasing interest rate will be applied annually to the 700 financial companies that use loans.
The BBC confirmed that the 59 housing construction cooperatives were among them.
It is disappointing that the institutions that have already been carefully established must now pay the accounts of those institutions that have been much less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We have learned that each company has to pay in proportion to the amount of deposit that is held by it. The companies share 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the loan will reach 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies have to set aside 81 million pounds to pay the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, director-general of the housing company's trade union, told BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
"It is a shame that institutions should pay the accounts of less careful institutions that have behaved carefully at the time of the expansion of the housing market."
According to BSA, none of the companies were destroyed since their operation began in 1945.
"In every respect, we have to look at this case in the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and members from the significant account," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 shall cover 7 months from the end of September of this year.
In 2010, a full annual interest will be paid, which may be twice as current.
Since housing cooperatives are self-assurance organisations, without shareholders, members will eventually have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or by lower interest rates after their deposits.
The milk price rises by five pence per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The dairy company in Jersey announced that it would increase the wholesale price per litre of milk by five pence from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since the twopnny rise in February and after a survey by an advisory company.
The resellers themselves decide whether to pass on the increase in prices to consumers.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of milk in Jersey changed last in 2002.
Requests by a former parliamentary representative in Bangladesh have been rejected to protect himself on the ground
The Bangladesh Court rejected the application for the protection of former parliamentary representative Sheikh Hasina on the loose, which means that they may arrest him when he returns to the country.
The lawyer told me that the court refused to defend him on the grounds that, during his parliamentary term, 50 million were blackmailed by a businessman (729,700).
This case is just one of the numerous charges of corruption against it.
Sheikh Hasina's old political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released for bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina will have to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, Awami League, insists that the interim government of the country, supported by the army, first give her full freedom.
According to the reports, although it was conditionally free to go abroad for treatment, the conditions for free footing do not clearly indicate whether you can preserve your freedom when you return to the country.
His lawyers say he's going to appeal in the Supreme Court against the decision of the appeal court.
"The appeal court dismissed Sheikh Hasina's application for bail that it was not necessary, as it was placed on a temporary free foot and is taking part in a treatment abroad," we learned from Huq's lawyer in Rafique.
"We will appeal against the decision of the appeal court."
According to his attorneys, he needs to be protected on the loose so that he can return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina was expected to return after 17 October.
Last year, he was arrested after the interim government supported by the army took over, but he was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny any charge brought against them.
Concerning the Afghan polio vaccination programme
According to the United Nations, almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan have remained out of the recently organized polio vaccination program for violence against Taliban.
Last week, vaccination in six UN provinces.
However, they said that for safety reasons they could not reach children living in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar South.
According to a UN speaker, all this has happened despite the Taliban making a promise: they will not attack or block the work of thousands of staff who take the vaccination.
BSkyB’s appeal concerning ITV was rejected
BskyB’s appeal against the decision of the Competition Commission, which called on it to reduce its interest in the rival TV TV in ITV.
The Court of Competition requires BSkyB to reduce its share of ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
Previously, the Committee concluded that BSkyB’s share of the company hinders competition and gives unfair influence to the company over ITV.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 and effectively prevented NTL, which has since been transferred to Virgin Medina - from buying the ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority announced that BSkyB’s share of ITV would jeopardise the independence of ITV, encouraging the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The director of Virginia, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom supervision were all opposed to buying.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in ITV’s participation was pointless and disproportionate, particularly in view of the fact that BSkyB expressed its willingness to give up its voting rights.
Further investigation of U.S. Attorneys' case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the loss of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The step followed the criticism of the decisions of government officials made by the Chief Inspector-General of the Justice Record.
The report was advocating officials of the White House, lawyers and former chief state attorney Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was a fear that the U.S. prosecutors were removed from political considerations.
Nora Dannehy, special prosecutor, will now investigate whether officials who have been consulted during the investigation have tried to stop justice by lying.
"The serious charges for possible crime have not yet been investigated and have not been clarified" said Mr Fine, Chief Inspector.
One of his main suggestions was to appoint a special prosecutor who was in charge of prosecuting the Witnesses.
The series began by removing nine state prosecutors from their position in the US judicial register in December 2006.
At that time, they said the U.S. attorneys were released for their poor performance.
However, it was later discovered that the state attorneys in the past received nothing worse than many other colleagues, which led many to the conclusion that political consideration behind the discharges was drawn.
Some state prosecutors participated in criminal proceedings against high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others were not willing to take part in the investigation of charges of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
The U.S. Attorneys are conducting an investigation under the government's orders and conducting court proceedings.
They can be lost at any time, but they can't be removed from their position for political reasons.
Back then, Alberto Gonzales, the head of the judicial files, has been targeted by the main state attorney for the loss and finally resigned.
A number of other officials in the judicial file have also given their resignation.
He was largely critical of Gonzales' role in this case, according to the Supreme Public Prosecutor's "first responsibility" for discharges, "speaked" control role, and "preciously removed" himself from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, former helper of Bush, believe that they have not demonstrated cooperation during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's ebony gets credit
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored by the Q Awards Award winner for the epistle "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer who will take over his special golden prize next week at the London celebration said it was an honor to be honored.
The nine minutes, 50 seconds long, song Meat Loaf was the song of the harvest album in 1977.
The Coldplay received the most entries for this year's prizes, they were listed in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that cross the limits of time or genres, and "Bat Out Of Hell" like this."
The song that Jim Steinman received called for a very big voice, and that sound was Meat Loaf's.
The song started with almost two-minute instrumentation.
It was released in 1979 as a small record, and it reached 15th position on the skateboards.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" was on the skateboard for almost nine years and then sold over 40 million copies of it.
Meat Loaf - a real name for Marvin Lee Aday - has recently faced health problems. Among other things, in 2003 because of his heart rhythm disorder, he had surgery after he fell on the stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel some concerts because of acute encephalitis.
Later, it turned out to be a cyst on his voice.
An unknown metropolitan street, often forgotten and perhaps soon sold
New York City has thousands of rays, orbits, and other sidewalks, some of which are famous, others only have practical functions.
However, many trained taxi drivers and long-term local residents could find it hard to tell where the Extra Place is located, mostly because they've never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village, heading north of the First Street without reaching the Second Street between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 9 m wide and 36 m long, and much more like a dusty alley than a major transport route.
No street signs.
You can't practically find it on a standard map.
But the street has wonders.
There it is, for example, the architect of Avalon Bay, the recently built First Street luxury building.
He wants to re-enact Extra Place and make sure that new buildings and new buildings can get in a cleaner way.
The wonders of the street include the long-term neighbors who were caught in the ham street, that this was the only remains of the past of the neighborhood's renovations.
However, the owner of the street, the building conservation and development department of the city, does not have to stick to it.
In this month, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street at a meeting of the District Management Committee.
However, the Committee would prefer the street to remain in town management and asked for a new plan for the next month, Susan Stetzer, head of municipal council No 3.
"There are very few areas in the city, and we want the Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," he said.
"There may be proposals for the renewal and treatment of Avalon, but we would also like to guarantee that it will remain available to the public."
A few months ago Avalon Bay announced that he wanted to rebuild the small street, and that he wanted to provide seats. These would be part of a cafe that the builder would probably hire a area.
The idea of Avalon Bay buying the street was first made public at this monthly meeting.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not insist on its possession.
"The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to renovate this leprosy alley and turn it into a pleasant public hill," he said, adding that the city proposed to buy.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Building Reserve Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office was responsible for building development and not managing it.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place doesn't have much historical significance.
According to some, in 1802, Philip Minthorne received the name "sench land", when many children were divided into Philip Minthorne's vast possession, and no one held a claim for the narrow Earth band.
The punk-rock monument closed in 2006, the back exit of CBGB was opened to Extra Place, and the street may have been the most important photo of the album on Ramones' Rocket to Russia.
"It was a lovely location" said Danny Fields, manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"He was with garbage, clothing girls, barrels and posters, and wooden leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how the middle class owned East Village, object to the sale of Extra Place. They argue that the public property of this piece, whatever modest it is, must remain in the community's possession.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rare one, which is an practically unchanged piece of the city and which must be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, the writer of the blog entitled “The New York City Book: A bitter nostalgia of the process of death of the city” wrote to his blog a part of the story about Extra Place that was published in the section “The New Yorker” in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end, which is even dark during the day, which is surrounded by rusty, iron-made storage doors and spating windows, and where the wind wears one week’s newspapers in the channels."
Except for some exceptions, the street looked the same way a few nights ago.
A rat ran off at the end of the street, next to the back door, which used to lead to CBGB, and now belongs to a higher-priced store.
It was graffiti on the walls, and an empty, 0.75 gallon beer bottle was lying next to a dumped, fresh paper millet.
Some walkers told me that they rarely remember the Extra Place, but they think we could use the renovation.
Fields said that some people believe that they underestimate the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
"I spent the most beautiful years of my life in dark, grumpy and disgusting places," he said.
Discussion on two-lingual education: Continued exposure to the English language environment
In this section of the Education Monitor Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the opinion of the candidates on two-lingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, who is an experienced researcher of Californian studies at the Pacific Public Policy Research Institute and head of educational research, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think it is, why the middle class needs school selection".
It is not easy to be in favour of voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama's proposals for education are also included.
According to Obama's campaign, "Afro-American and Spanish-based students are significantly less likely to get a degree than white students," and that's true.
In order to overcome differences in performance, Obama's educational plan explicitly supports, including "transitional two-lingual" education for students in English.
At the same time, Obama’s commitment to two-lingual education, which puts the emphasis on school education in non-English languages, is above his interest in combating high performance differences.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep contract primary school in the east of Los Angeles County.
Most of the school students have Spanish lips and low incomes.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, learn English.
Nevertheless, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results at the 2008 state mathematics test.
It is equally impressive that 93% of the fourth graders have completed excellent tests in English and literature.
This incredible performance is not measured by the instrument Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street focuses on repeating, exercising, continuing evaluation of skills and rejecting objections.
In addition, and this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's educational principle is the "completely embracing" of students studying English to the linguistic environment.
The essence of the absorbing method is the almost exclusive use of English in teaching other objects.
Mikels, who opposes two-lingual education, said: "We have won an excellent success in walking into a classroom," he wouldn't know who the student came back from Mexico 12 months ago."
He said, "We're working."
Would Obama set other schools like Sixth Street Prep to teach a significant number of Spanish and English students as a follow-up example?
The results achieved by the school should be clear, however, because of the education policy of its own party (the National Education Associations have long supported dual-language education) and, since they are consistently standing in favour of dual-language education, we cannot be sure of Obama's reaction.
While agreeing that immigrants have to learn English, Obama recently expressed appreciation for the question when he said that people should not be so concerned about the "alternatively English" billmaking.
Instead, he said, "they should be able to talk Spanish to their children."
If Obama really wants to reduce the differences between the results, he should seriously study the models that work instead of looking down and taking them into nothing.
The price of oil fell steeply because of the renewed concerns about the economy
On Monday, oil prices were at high levels due to concerns that America's rescue plan for financial markets will not be able to bring the economy back.
The raw oil's securities were back at $99.80 this morning at the New York Trade Exchange.
Prices have been reduced by over $20 as a barrel since last Monday.
For the past two weeks, the stock exchanges were triggered by the financial disturbance in Wall Street, and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices reached 145.29 per barrel in July, at the beginning of this month almost $90 were recovered at the beginning of this month before again they were affected by the incalculable uncertainty of financial markets.
On Monday, the concern again brought investors into power even after the convention leaders announced that they had agreed on an economic rescue mission that was the biggest ever in history.
The news is a shadow of concern that the financial crisis will not be over for a long time.
At the latest event of the emerging crisis, Citigroup will buy up the bank business of Wachovia Corporation, announced by the government on Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg Governments have partially nationalised the European Financial Conglomeration, Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital, as a result of the desperate weekend consultations, "it seems that the rescue attempt has failed to boost the stock trading mood."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that demand for goods, such as oil, will also decrease.
"The future of the market for stock shares, interest rates and exchange rates has become uncertain around the world" said Deutsche Bank's analyst to investors.
"We do not think that the market for goods will be avoided by the epidemic."
From the point of view of the stock market, the biggest issue is how far the US's "disease" is infected with the whole world, especially China.
As the slowdown in economic growth has led to oil consumption, banks' analysts have lost their expectations for next year, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices by 20%.
With his second quarter browser, the team set up his record
After spending more than eight seasons in the Jets field than anyone else, Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything.
But then he looked at the second quarter of decomposing on Sunday, when Jets turned a game without a point into a sensation game.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the play of the Jets and Arizona Cardinals with the dark clouds in the sky began.
Brett Favre, a quarterback with a 12-yard touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles, has been given the perfect lead for an afternoon during which they have developed significantly further cooperation.
Favre even gave Coles two touchdowns in this quarter, including when two Cornerbacks fell 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't feel sorry for the trouble," Favre said about all the passport he gave to Coles.
"Pokoli's a good player.
We've been able to communicate well so far, regardless of what people think."
While Favre and Coles played the ball, the defense stopped the Cardinals' controller, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis caught a bad shot in the cornerback position and threw it back with 32 yards touchdown.
Eric Smith, the safe player has got into another pass, and he's got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker managed to knock the ball out of Warner's hands.
This last turn could have been the most amazing mozzana in the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball ten seconds before the end, and the Jets got it, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field, thus setting the 34-0 score.
This was the best result that Jets has achieved within a quarter of now.
When they asked Jets' coach Eric Mangini to describe the senseful nature of the game, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When they told him that both - in the third quarter Cardinals acquired 21 points that Jets didn't acquire one - Mangini said, "I have to say I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
We got a lot of points in a short time."
The rest of Gebrselassie will break his own world record
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many people consider the best medium- and long-term traveler ever living in Berlin when he broke his world record on Sunday, thus becoming the first one to run the 42,2 km [42,2 km] [2 km] [2] [4 minutes].
With the victory over the time of 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds on the previous result of 2:04:26, which was achieved last year in Berlin.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie set up the 26th world record of his career in a wide range of areas that, from 1500 meters to marathon, won a world champion or reached a world record.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, which, therefore, may have proved to be too cautious, that air pollution would further aggravate asthmatic problems.
Instead, he called me on the Berlin marathon.
In almost perfect circumstances - day-time, initially at 9 °C and at 13 °C - won at Gebrselassie on Sunday, incredible, 2 minutes every 56 seconds.
Since the marathon has not been launched before, such as Gebrselassie, and Paul Terga in Kenya has gone to longer distances, the marathon record has been reduced more than two minutes in the past decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in 1998 with a result of 2:06:05 in Berlin.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago, his two legs were snoring, and he couldn't train for two weeks.
It's obvious he's been refreshed during the forced rest of his life, and he's not brunching.
"I'm happy for you" said Gebrselassie to the reporters.
"It all turned out perfectly.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had doubts, but finally everything was fine."
He got some criticisms, especially from Kenya, the eastern African rivalry of Ethiopia - that he uses too many aids during his competitions, usually avoids many world-famous marathon drivers, so he'll be left on his ramps like he's running on a track and place world records in front of the competition.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie's potential in the long run.
Gebrselassie, on Sunday, during four ostriches in Kenya, reached the surface at 1:02:04.
Two high-end kenyai runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after they got tired.
He left Kwambai with a last spray in front of the target at a distance of 4,8 km, with a target of 2:05:36, 5 minutes to improve the individual's best.
Kamathi came in third under 2:07:48.
In the female competition Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now German citizen, has closed a remarkable year with the seventh fastest victory at 2:19:19.
The world peak is held by the British Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25.
Last spring the 36-year-old Mikitenko won a surprise with the London marathon 2:24:14.
As a result of his alleged back injury to the Beijing Olympics, he was quickly healed and won the Berlin marathon, where he improved five minutes on his individual peak, and that was the third marathon long run he was involved in.
He won the competition with a good point: he first allowed a four-person group of Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and take significant lead, and then he came after them about 30 km.
The Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa was the second target of 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop in Kenya became the third with a result of 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and trials of black people
In the Greater's experience park in Orlto - a few miles away from everything that shines, loud and powerful - lies in a quiet small town, where the pride and blasphemy of African life experience were born.
Eatonville, the first purely black town that was integrated into the country, and which was the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as in 1935: "the five lakes, three croquets, 300 brown skin, 300 good swimmer, plenty of guavas and two school cities, no prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, and Ruby Dee have been to the Zora annual festival. The event series in Eatonville is held in honor of the most famous female writer, Hurston.
However, in many respects the city which it described and made it a tourist attraction, which is also included in the Florida Road Book published by the Project of the Federal Letters of the Age of Vanity.
The same independent, dignityful and sealing as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston was written in the Florida, town blacks often refused to share their true thoughts with white people who "know little of us that they don't know what to miss."
Even the year when the black presidential candidate Barack Obama encourages an open exchange of views on the racial issue, many people here are untrustful of the eyes of outsiders.
"We're very careful about how to tell our story" - reported the 59-year-old Hortense Jones who lived here all his life and was a member of the oldest church in the city.
"I have to tell you this."
Eatonville has long been characterised by a paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, the historical model of black stand-up is almost 2400 people in a community where poverty indicators double the national average.
Partly the literary node, and partly as a result of American slavery, he sometimes looked down, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black culture that flourishes in the shadow of oak trees.
It is not surprising, then, that the inhabitants here are proud and protective at the same time.
The picture from Eatonville has been important since Zora (this is what everyone calls Hurston).
In the books written in the honest, strong dialect - like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) - he introduced his hometown to the world.
The fifth paragraph of the Florida Travel Book transformed the city, which lies next to the 17th Avenue. This road leads from Florida's previously forgotten center to one of the locations of black history and human dramas.
Hurston, who was brave in both life and literature, whether he was a drummer, introduced his readers to the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then looked into the more confidential spheres.
He wrote, "We find modern public school right from the road, brown-based with white shirts, carefully maintained courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller cares about, although he can barely write and read."
She mentioned her widow Dash's new husband and wrote Lee Glenn "all kinds of drinks and anything that might be necessary for temporary accommodation."
Thus, in a few hundred words, Hurston brought Ethanville into contact with autonomy, but at the same time, inconsistency, remorse, and sex.
Obviously, the Fodor's travel book introduced it differently.
This description really didn't like everyone.
"Zora said things as they were" - reported the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls.
He said, "That some people didn't like it."
They still remember Hurston here as the living special who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville in Florida.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston rushed into town, he usually arrived unannounced in a glamorous Chevrolet, cigarettes, and long-terms in a city where people still proud of their dignity.
Most people have been charmed, said Franklin, but many people have been plucked.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Franklin.
However, on the terrace watching the Lake Sabelia, where, most likely, Hurston was baptized, he added in his chair: "I have stayed for too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were not released again.
It seemed that, together with most of the world, Eatonville had forgotten about it.
Although he was once a popular writer, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in an unmarked grave at Fort Pierce, Florida, where he used to live.
There were no significant monuments in Eatonville, or large, public readings.
"I don't think you understand how much you've enriched the world, or what you've left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the Hurston biography published in 2003.
The turning point came in 1980.
The officials of Orange county wanted to build a five-lane route across the city instead of the two-way main street Kennedy, whose role was important in the life of the community.
The expansion of Orlova has already entered the Interstate 4 motorways on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still down after a difficult period of history.
Among other things, forced integration has brought an end to the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggles related to racial confusion had a taste of hatred with society.
"At the time, a bunch of white boys came through, and they threw on the side of the road with a string and other things," said Franklin.
"There was a lady who died in this.
They threw a greek shirt out of a car."
In a letter to the Orlando Sentinel in 1953, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's decision to promote violent integration, and he said about the decision called "Brown v. Board of Education": "It is more insulting than it respects my race."
Today, residents say that the desegregation of schools was positive in some respects, weakened the association of the Eatonvilles and undermined the confidence of young people.
"Black children are used to killing them - that is what I remember - man killed his teacher in the morning and evening" - reported the daughter of N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins, CEO of the nonprofit organization Eatonville Community.
"This was until the students and teachers came from a common place" was added.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean, there were cultural differences between us" said Nathir.
However, human rights helped in the rise of many other Zora Neale Hurston, in black writers, actors and artists who are uplifting their prejudices, as he did, with the confidence of self and ranks as follows: "How can anyone deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!
That's inconceivable for me."
In 1975 Alice Walker took me to Hurston's unmarked grave and started fighting to return his reputation.
Five years later, a recognised Hurston biography, written by Robert E. Hemenway, was put on the shelf of the books stores, which once again included the roles of America.
The road construction project would have started just when Eatonville's most famous daughter was back at the focus of attention.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw him as a rescuer.
In 1988, the community organised a Hurston festival to show us what would ruin the county's main route.
Thousands of fans arrived at the opening event later than two years ago, and many have returned to the ceremony in January.
A few years later, the county withdrew from its proposal for road construction.
"As a result of the five-way expansion, the community has relived, linked to full speed, which means real civil pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd said more easily: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped change the image of the city itself.
More and more people outside the city were reported, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to attend church in 1993, and the locals began to revalue the past.
Eatonville entered the national historic register in 1998.
In 2006, the new single library (named naturally Hurston) opened, re-created and built on Kennedy’s radio.
Eatonville continues to have Florida's cuckoo: it's not only 10 km from the centre of Orlando, but sometimes it's like there's an outskirts in the summer rain; it's as small as when 27 black families set up in the 1880s.
(Today 90% of residents are black.)
They're still taking care of outsiders who come here looking for the story of Eatonville.
Most interviews require prior authorisation, and some things - such as Eatonville's oldest fresco, which is painted by a white man and pictures black people working on the ground - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, including the self-assured teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to our lively red - are afraid that their separate community is misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival has become more and more wide, the pride of the home town has grown.
In particular, young people are increasingly viewed as Eatonville, as Hurston saw his own species: amazing, problems and everything, neither better nor worse, just as proud, creative, sore, foolish, and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
The honest civil bond is silenced to Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to the local government after college, or to take a job with the police, who thinks they're going to help.
And it seems that younger people have learned the right way to describe Eatonville, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twin: Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just travel here believe that this city is nothing compared to the rest" said Alondra Kenon recently after the worship of God on Sunday.
"But if someone stops and wants to have some time to get to know his history, then it's a very beautiful city."
We all speak the language of finance in New York
Nothing's changed on the surface.
If the tourists didn't care about the news fairs and the huge television projectors on Times Square, I wouldn't notice they're in the middle of a storm.
The bankers and venture fund managers who have held New York in power have been living the hardest days since 1929.
The couriers are still running their metal trucks through the sidewalks, carrying the trays with Muffin to the morning's meetings.
The men of the Spanish lips are still snooping among the blocks, carrying 50 of them as human mussels, hanging on a loop similar to an verb that crosses their shoulders.
The office staff are still in line for their sweet bakery at the food cars on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7.
I didn't feel like it was any crisis until Thursday night, despite all the alarming news, I decided to open a new bank account.
I also deliberately planned to deal with this in my local account of JP Morgan Chase at my afternoon rest, but there were 20 people in my line.
Not at the bank bank bank window, where money can be accepted or paid, but at the customer service counter, where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for directions to Macy's store, and where new customers open a bank account.
A lot of people in front of me, I found out later from Starr, the banker who ordered me, they were in line with the same intent as me.
However, unlike me, they have already taken their money from smaller banks in their place of residence, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took money from the so-called savings banks (such as housing cooperatives), credit cooperatives, and small-city savings funds that only operate in a single state and allegedly treat their clients as family members.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks went silent.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with USD 327 billion in capital, was in bankruptcy, and when the New Yorkers came home on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, made a savings of USD 440 billion.
The office and shop workers in front of me, afraid of another collapse, transferred their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe haven, to the bank that makes most capital injections on Wall Street.
The simple New York people have become expert in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman on her phone at the local Chinese store spoke of Lehman Brothers and his big-looking CEO Dick Fuld complaining about a lazy colleague.
Lyn, the uniform of my apartment's block, changed into a caretaker's theme for his fifty-years, not Brad and Angelina, or my food delivery, as we used to.
He said to me after I went to the bank, "I invested all my money I saved in money market instruments.
I've changed, I don't take risks."
Musulman's graves were abused while Austria turned right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the Right-Steam Party and the Philippines Dewinter, from the right-hand side of the Belgian party, from Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008, on which the organization "Variouss Against the Impact of Islam" was presented.
It was accompanied by signs of transport signs that drew through red lines.
According to the police, extremes on the outskirts of the extremes are responsible for the abuse of the funerals on the Austrian Muslims, which took place on the same weekend, when the outermost parties made a significant progress in national elections.
There were more than 90 graves in the trauni cemetery next to Linz, some Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators drew Jewish symbols, such as David's star, on a few graves, but according to the detectives, they were just trying to hide their extreme motives, which stem from the hatred of the Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident can be linked in some way to the elections.
A spokesperson in the local Islamic community said that they were "seriously fine" in the face of the cries that took place shortly before the end of Ramadan the Muslim religious month.
At the same time, Austria will conduct an examination of its conscience after the parliamentary elections yesterday, in which the language of the political balance was right.
The two edge-right parties, which received nearly 30% of the votes, campaigned for the future of the Freedom Party and the Alliance of Austria for a strongly anti-migration law, and stamped some of them as critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Freedom Party, who has obtained more than 18% of the votes, has also expressed campaign against the headgears and burkaes, and has also expressed its lack of contact with Islamic food.
At the final meeting of the party in Vienna, he spoke about 'European brotherhood', which prevents Islamic strengthening.
Both parties want to ban the construction of the fairs and themselves, on the ground that they are political symbols of Austria and of the ongoing Islamization of Europe.
According to the polls and analyses of the public opinion on the direct outcome of the extreme win-win elections, the change was largely due to the young voting base, who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter has been banned from a foreign journey
Garry Glitter, convicted of rape of children, is a known rock star from the court's ban on travelling to France and Spain.
The judges decided, in addition to the six-month ban on Glitter, to inform the control authorities of their intention to travel to Spain through France.
The field police have obtained a ban on travel on Thursday after submitting evidence of rape judgments against the court against Glitter against children.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, was not involved in the trial of Ashford Magistrates, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court speaker said: "On Thursday, 25 September, the field police submitted a request to the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent travel to France and Spain by Paul Gadd on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter has informed the authorities of his foreign travel intention because it is required by the law on persons involved in the register of sex offenders.
You must inform the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You also have to inform the police at least seven days before you leave.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to five years of imprisonment.
The airport police said they didn't want to talk about individual cases in Glitter County and possible whereabouts.
From the spokesperson of the field police, we found out: "The field police are doing everything they can to protect the children within the country and abroad.
"We believe it is easier to check someone by not leaving the United Kingdom, because there is a comprehensive system here that we will be able to manage the potential risks more effectively.
"The most important task of the police in the field is to protect the population of Kent. Through close cooperation, we are continuing to monitor the behaviour of persons in the register of sex offenders and in the county to minimise the potential risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a prison in Vietnam for raping a 10 and a 11 - year - old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to land on a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he felt unwell and refused to fly to London.
Country authorities did not pass the passport test, so eventually they flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to enter the country, so they flew back to Bangkok, where officials of the State Police and the Immigration Service insisted to return to Britain.
Finally, on 22 August, he arrived at the terminal of Heathrow airport 3 and remained there until his lawyer David Corker went to the court in West London, Uxbridge, which, according to Scotland Yard’s application, was registered to the sex offenders under a court order.
Glitter used to spend four months in prison for possession of photos of child rape in the United Kingdom in 1999.
According to a sources from the Ministry of Interior, Jacqui Smith, State Secretary for Home Affairs, welcomed the fact that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I'm not taking pictures on stage because I'd like to introduce the artist from my personal site"
No decorations, no hairs, no dancing shoes.
The Grand Masters of Flamenco, without the excitement of the action, to get to know the ordinary faces of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the ordinary man.
And you can't separate these two sides, except for inconceivable moments away from the audience, when you can take a personal move, grab the depth of an captured look, or you can look at the beauty of the unplaying, yet expressive hand of the artist who is preparing for his non-stage performance.
In the German Günther Bauer Flamenco party series, the theatre of singers, dancers and guitarists is combined with this less known ordinary site of the masters.
Through the photographs, the unique iconography of the flamenco is presented from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of the Snow Day of Flamenco Photography, "reflects the international importance of flamenco from day to day", considers the author, adding that Flamenco-people could be a "responsible of anyone, because the images can be seen by observer to realize that these pictures are not typically portraying artists.
These people on the street are artists who are able to bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and throw the audience on the air.
On stage photography is, however, not suitable for the capture of their personalities.
Their personal personality and character are at the very bottom of their being.
I wanted to create an atmosphere that would allow me to inherit, with the help of the camera, the personality of the greats of the flamenco."
The Cante de las Minas festival took a boost to Bauer's long trip in 1997, where portraits of flamenco performers, guitarists and dancers were made with a record camera.
These portraits refer to classic photography thanks to camera and theme selection.
However, the use of the various stylistic tools is interrupted by traditional visualization and modernity. The following thought is truly reflecting Bauer's idea of the flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, which, however, changes from day to day and is always impressive."
It's not the dance, it's not the song or the music itself, it's the artist's personality, it's the character of the audience.
In the days you can see works in El Fotomata gallery, looking for the essences of your encounter with the artistic seam, which becomes visible through the way of perception, being and displaying.
The well-known forms of Flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are the metal signature of this photo collection of later 60 artists.
The project has also become a flamenco-antology, which will soon be published a album containing portraits at the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits for two years has been reinventing the idea with the "SportART project" series of Veteran athletes.
Although the concept of the Flamenco party is slightly different from that, the photographer adds: "I love to photograph people, to know them and to enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, photography is the most difficult work of portraits.
The fate of people, people, people, people you don't know sometimes, or people who just want to take a few minutes to take a photo shoot.
But despite these circumstances, I always try to make my ideas happen as a photographer.
The exhibition, selected from the portraits of the contemporary Flamenco party, is located in El Fotómata Galéria, in Alameda de Hercules parallel to 20th of October.
Vargas Llos says the novel he works on is "ready"
The scene and action are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also working on the writing of his new novel. The main character of the novel is Irish nationalist Roger Bosper, who lived 20 years in Congo and Amazonia.
Also a potential writer at the Royal Nobel Prize yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia event admitted that his current work was "ready perseverance" and "any sign of not having to write" the novel.
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it, and I hope that I will do it at some point at the end" - he put his talk in those words at the festival of ideas, thought and opinion exchanges, which took thousands of writers, historians and journalists for four days in the city of Aqueduct, and thousands of visitors.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was one of the most outstanding participants in the festival of literature and also replaced the hopes associated with it.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival award by the participants, Dickens' "Our Dear Friend" novel. The performance filled Juan Bravo theater.
The audience, who gave her thanks to Felix Romeo. The watch quickly went out for the audience, during which the writer of the Perun told her about the amazing opportunity to remember and a great deal of humor, how he developed his special adventure of reading passion and the desire to live life; how to bridge the passion through the writing method, a busy documentation, a lot of repairs and rewrites; how he had been brought to his profession by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what memories are based on.
The Latin American novelist acknowledged that it was impossible to assess or show whether books change our lives, but he added: "I don't think literature is a mere fun or teenage life experience", as it affects people and causes them to think, so he asked the writers not to allow the temptation to be tempted and to be held accountable to their profession.
Because of the weather in moors, there's a shorter goodbye to Pozoblanco, but there's also no riding bulls.
Traditionally, the horseback bullied as the closing record of the Pozoblanco Festivals was removed from the show yesterday morning after the future horserader was found unfit for the arena.
As a result, the Committee decided, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, to stay behind with the Bible.
Weather defaults have seriously torn the ceremony series, since two of the three events could not have been held.
On Saturday, the rainfall left me with the second bull.
The future main characters, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista Castilblanco, would have fought with bulls.
That's how they kept it on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, and he took three ears home as a trophies.
On the same afternoon Alejandro Talavante received a number of honours and trophies as a trophies, but this was more due to the audience than to its own performance.
After that, however, El Juli, who contributed little to the ageing of the name of the arena Los Llanos.
After a convenient round with the second bull, a large part of the audience managed to get it out of the bridge.
A truck carrying two tons of haist tried to escape roadside control
Four hours in the morning 50 minutes.
The Basque District Police is conducting traffic checks in the administrative area of Armiñón (Alava).
The authorities will stop a van in which the two passengers are travelling, and passengers will try to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of hash, was not noticeable.
The detectives tracked the passengers, and one of them was arrested by a 28-year-old man, and identified as A. A. J., the Basque government Department of Home Affairs.
The man who was captured is charged with drug trafficking and indictments.
The case took place in the administrative area of Armiñón, where the employees of the Álavai Forgalmi traffic control were subject to a traffic check on the N-1 motorway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused obedience, suddenly gave me gas and then left the inspection site.
The detectives went after him, and then the vehicle stopped a few miles away from the stopway, and his passengers fled from the highway to a forest area.
The Basque Regional Police finally captured one of them, and after examining the Iveco Daily brand van, he took a shipment of 2178 kilograms of belly.
The car's back abdominals were transported to the police bodies to investigate more thoroughly and measure the drug.
In addition, during the verification, it has been demonstrated that the false plate plate of the vehicle does not match the particulars contained in the van's documents, and therefore proceedings are also initiated against the arrested person for the detection of a public document.
The Basque Regional Police Department is conducting an investigation aimed, on the one hand, at arresting another suspect, who, as we have already mentioned, fled the motorway, and on the other hand, to determine the origin of the drug taken.
The 28-year-old accused, A.A. J., was transferred to the police to conduct the necessary interrogations, and then court measures started within a few hours.
They arrested Heather Lockler actress because he was under the influence of the drug.
Heather Lockler, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series this weekend arrested the police in Santa Barbara (California) because it led to the effects of the drug.
According to a witness, he was trying to leave the parking lot in Montecito, a spokesperson for the People magazine, California traffic control.
According to the witness, around 16 o'clock, Lockler "he pushed the gas all the way down, stretched the engine, tried to leave the parking lot in advance and backwards, and went through the sunglasses several times in the back."
Soon later, the witness, who probably didn't recognize the actress, saw Lockler stop at a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also informed the police because he was concerned about Lockler's life.
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially paralyzed the traffic of the highway.
It seemed like a "Zavart", so the patrols took him to a specialised center for drug and alcohol testing.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was a co-operator, and the alcohol consumption was almost immediately excluded, and the speaker also said that, based on the first impression by the officers, it was considered to have been under the influence of Lockler.
Lockleart was arrested and suspected under the influence of an unidentified drug. He was transported to the local prison around 19 hours later, where he was released.
Lockler came out of a Arizonan sanatorium two months ago, where he was treated for his anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the IU (United Left) Annalose Federation to take care of the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, IU Secretary-General and United Left Representative today stated that the regional Federation of Development will take a decision on the case of Seville's Self-government of Youth and Sport, Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned last week after being accused of providing family benefits in exchange for his position.
"In these things, I am a far-reaching federalist, and this case is indeed a matter of the authority of the donor organisation," Llamazare pointed out to the way in which the party has to apply to its former member of the City Council in Seville.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that, in the detection of any irregularities that Silva might have made, 'visibility' should be kept in mind: 'At IU has always been on the ground in order to ensure that such cases are fully transparent'.
He added that part of the training is "in the case of civil servants, also the strict code of ethics."
"Mary blood", episode of Garci
The work by Benito Pérez Galdos National Epizodes inspired José Luis Garci, who presents the famous anti-French resurrection of the Spaniards in the May blood, which is the largest creation of almost EUR 15 million in the world budget, cinematography.
Accordingly, the director has always tried to illustrate the human flood and social analysis of his known novelist's work. Garci told the public audience of the actors today in the film with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarria.
More than two and a half hours of Mayus blood is presented on Friday in the cinema, and later, Telemadrid will be used as miniseries for more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, the great admirer of Galdos' literature with this film, has achieved his childhood dream. All this is due to Esperanza Aguirre, because she has entrusted him three years ago from the Madrid Convention to make a monument for the 200th anniversary of the events in Madrid 2 May. Garci accepted the request on condition that the story could be given to the National Epizosians.
The 15 million budget was fully financed by the London Autonomised, and Garci was given a special opportunity: he could present 'the disturbed Spanishs, who, by mistake, stood next to the wrong leader, because the fight for independence, led the country to a huge loss of control of Ferdinand VII.' said.
However, the director expressed his regret that he could not account for the budget of Alatriste or Goya's fantoms that hit Mayus' blood more than twice. He was forced to skip a few scenes from the script, which, as many other times, was recorded with Horacio Valcárcell.
So he applied to the usual working method of the director of the re-launch, and he recorded the scenes with the actors he had already started before the shooting. Casting was not because Garci considered it "mechanist", and because, as he said, "the director's master's part of the theatre and cinema to find out what's going on in the industry we're working in."
Several actors in May's blood, such as Miguel Relana, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not go to the camera first.
Garci, who can be proud of four Oscars and a Oscar award, believes that Spanish candidates representing Spain before the Hollywood Academy, i.e. May's blood, seven French pool tables and one of the finally selected blind solar revolutions, represent neither the young generation of Spanish cinema, said "dead should be presented".
Garci's film doesn't count on prizes.
"Then you think you're working for the afterlife, and then you realize that it only matters to be successful, and eventually you're happy to have one more film ready," says Garci, with a 30-year-old career behind her back.
Isabel Bayón recalls Tórtola Valencia’s life and art as a dancer in Seville
A Flamenco dancer in Seville points out to be a dance girl in Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia was born in Triana district and moved to London with his parents at the age of three.
He was an expert in free dancing and Eastern dance.
During his moving life, he fought as a pioneer for female equality, whether Isadora Duncan, Virginia Voolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhaist and a vegetarian and fought against the wearer that inhibits the freedom of women.
He blew up a dance and aesthetic revolution in war Europe, and his life shocked Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gambo, and he offered me attention to Torto, whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said: "It's not our goal to tell you about life's history, it's to grab your soul.
The titles of his dance have led to flamenco styles.
For example, about the "pilango dance" on guaj or the "cold dance" on the tango.
"He danced in advance, and others say that my style is also characterized by it" - he tells.
The light of the performance is raised by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda, after the open door, is now singing again at Isabel's performance; and Matilde Coral, who, in this case, exceptionally wanted to work with a former disciple.
"Matilde transforms the older Tortola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you said yes to the request. I'm very pleased you're doing my part."
In addition, the production is attended by Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga musical directors and guitarists, Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón singer; El Páarro batter, Rafa El Viola brácsás, as well as Juanfra Juárez, an actor who always plays a constant character with his love of the true diva.
The piece also presents the life of a woman living in London, but also includes Europe, and it will then also go to distant landscapes, including India, the United States or Italy.
"That's why I wanted to make him remember, because his personality had a big impact on his own age, but they don't know him anymore and they don't appreciate his work much less," says Bayon.
The performance will begin at the Lope de Vega theater at 30 pm tonight.
At the end of the Triennium, there is also the "A freshly married poet's diary"
The first illustrated edition of the newly married poet's journal will be in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobies in May 1916. The presentation is part of the series of programmes of Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) organized by the Andalúz Regional Government Cultural Committee for the 50th anniversary of the award of the empire Nobel Prize and their deaths.
Thus the closing record of Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium is the re-issue of this work, the International Congress in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize-winner Memorial and the "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The bright summer tree". This exhibition was opened in May this year, and is scheduled to visit New York for the time of the International Congress.
A total of eight hundred copies of the Andalus Regional Government's Cultural Committee, published by Perdo Tabernero, was illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso from a newly married poet's journal to promote the reputation and work of one of the most widely provided poets.
Paul Newman's not so attractive America
"God sometimes makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that."
The quote comes from actress Sally Field who worked with Newman in the film "The victims of the sensation" and reflects the shock and infidelity caused by the death of Newman in the American cinema and the whole of America.
It's hard to get Oscar.
He retired in 2007,
and was known to be ill,
But he's still working on everyone's death.
"It's not possible to put our feelings in words, and I've just lost a good friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "it made my life better and this country."
No one was afraid of becoming ridiculous or overdoing.
One of the heroes of the cinema and home went away in a particularly dark period, which was sunk by the fear of terrorism and market conditions, the desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When such difficult times go by and many easily lose their virtues and very few people we can look up to, we don't have to be Luis Cernus to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of the people, he demonstrated the beauty and justice of the plátói.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and protector of lost and won cases, starting with the drug-related fund for the memory of his first-born son, from the start of his home-like bio-food brand.
It was a real gift for a country that was hard to overcome in its suicidal nutrition culture.
The prettiest miracle wave went all Hollywood without looking at nationalities and origin.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, said he died not a man but an era.
Another English student, Sam Mendes, declared that his work with Newmann clearly meant the peak of his career.
Russell Crowe, a bad boy from Australia, called Newman the biggest inspiration.
George Clooney, who may have been one of the few who are trying to follow Paul Newman's way of life today, established a high level of integrity for all of us. They require honesty and privacy away from serious and cameras.
It's not always easy if it's even possible in the middle of today's media jungle.
Still, there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman's a role model.
Once divorced, but then 50 years of loyal marriage to Joanne Woodward, he would have had many occasions for infidelity.
"Why should I eat burgers somewhere else if there's meat at home?" he was kidding.
In heaven, he may be proud that his daughters on earth are also fans, which is not so common in America.
"At one of all his formations, he was not as proud as the faithful husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather, and the devoted human friend."
The green road to the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us have dreamt of a Madrid Olympic Games, and after 2012 it may become 2016.
But, I'm asking, are we really ready for it?
Because if we're going out of the race yesterday, I don't think so.
They called it the perfect race, but I see it was the worst of many of the things I've ever been.
It was characterized by a block of incognitions, and if you had to be evaluated once, and I would be the investigator, it would clearly fail the result.
But let's go in line and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began by receiving the serial number because this had to happen earlier.
This is not yet a problem in itself, but if you go faster, at least get everything at the same time (including the chip, to avoid later position).
Well, that's not what happened.
First, only the number was handed over (the first nonsense, only sooner to go) and (the usual line after the job), which was surprising, only S's T-shirt (the second nonsense, because I had a point XL size)!
What world are we living in?
Or is it because of the crisis that they've decided to save money and only buy cheaper, small shirts?
But anyway, these things are still going to be ruined compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to take over the chip early, the job in the line took 15 minutes from the arrival, and even the backpack had to be handed down.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is inexplicable for a race of more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't given up the backpack yet.
In addition, the rain made it even more pleasant for more than 40 minutes of waiting, as measured by the efforts to raise people's and stand-up.
I think we'll get about 500 pneumonias by tomorrow, as well as some of us, including myself, not with the actual time, and I assume that the chipm has wrongly recorded the start.
If they asked me about the perfect race, of course, I wouldn't think of that.
So I think we can continue to dream about a well-prepared city in Olympics.
Microsoft (virtual) is looking for
At the MIT Exploring Technologies Conference, Microsoft has introduced the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of non-intelligent - artificial intelligence that can still perform some essential tasks. For example, he can call a taxi (or a vehicle that travels to Microsoft in the field of the company) on the basis of information from the interview.
This "reception" is a camera and a form and facial recognition system that allows you to recognize how many of them are in the room, who they are - even, note what clothes they wear - and also hear and understand the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, you can group those present on the basis of the discussions.
In the presentation video, the reception lady identifies a third person, but knows that it is not part of the company that talks with her and is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he came to visit someone and he'll make sure he's in a hurry to help him.
All this without the blue screen.
It's amazing.
But this is, of course, the music of the future.
At present, the company has a major role to play, such as the development of a new version of Windows operating system.
A lot of people this week said that Microsoft changed strategy.
Windows will be 7 smaller and contain less ancillary programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were running more than many commercial garbage instead of just the necessary programs, then machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's something.
The Spanish wax has been invented, given that Microsoft has so far added extra features and extras to Windows in all new versions.
The direction change will be reversed.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly in need of background, and the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I also joined the theory that Google made the first move to make Windows competitors.
Many have rightly acknowledged that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary, as it is essential for hardware and software dialogue.
You play the same role as your wife or husband when you want to tell your mother something.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it must be counted on the operating system "death", not absolute, but relative.
This weekly statement by Ballmer supports this thought.
People are paying less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
The computer is only turned on to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and more and more time to browse than we spend in the world of windows.
What, then, is most of the applications combined with the system done?
Less sometimes more.
And Windows 7 is less, and it's got to be a lot less than the Vista.
It's less difficult, less tense, less complicated.
Microsoft aims to integrate its services on-line rather than to mean an alternative to Google.
All of them very much need, I'm already saying an example of why.
This photo was taken at the beginning of the month in a study group designed for Microsoft in Redmond.
On the soda machine, a poster calls them, they use the company's browser.
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft manufacturers used Google for internet browsing.
By the way, last week, the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has also been announced.
Not in early 2009, but in the end, rather in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to throw Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 into a single market.
After all, the cell phone is more and more of a computer function.
But the slip, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will certainly ruin their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
That's what Pablo Picasso wore in the diamond of Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola, as well as this one of the basic costumes of the mother-in-lawed gay customers.
And even if we're on the list of specialities, we can even remember the peace figure of the narrator's narrator's cracker.
But what are we talking about?
I mean, about "tank", as the English lips call it, but none of these rivals with Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles are allowed to compete.
First of all, because of their elegant name - although they only refer to it as "Marcel", which they owe to sport, the legend says that Marcel Cerdan's boxing director, Edith Piaf's singer.
Marcel's excellent cotton, unisex setting, special emblem and small Belgian flag appear among his competitors. The latter are the most prominent models hidden in the neck of the shirt.
But the Belgian company doesn't just make tank tops.
Sports leaders, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, wooltens, sailors, baby clothes, mini-sorts - and we can still list all of the products of the company.
And they're all in the category of comfortable underwear,
Even though it's unfortunate to wear them as a underwear.
They're too good for that.
"I'd love to be a young mother, no matter who the father is."
He is very similar to his brother, but he was able to accomplish himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but it's full of energy.
At present, the Cruz Sisters want to play a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling means much more than some pretty and beautiful girls name something.
There was a promotion of the new Paris office of Mango and the most attractive fashion prizes sponsored by the Spanish company.
It's getting warm and gentle.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We will present Mango's new autumn-seven collection with my brother Penelope. We will also participate in the publication of the Second Mango Fashion Awards and the gala for Valentine's respect at Opera.
It's a busy day, it's true, but it's exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango Company where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the movie of the '50s and '60s; there's a lot we've taken over.
And then, a lot of times I just walk into the city and watch the women dress, how they choose their clothes - this is one of my favorite times.
You work as a dancer, actress and fashion designer.
That's what I think, too, but in the end, these three things are connected, because they have a lot of points in common.
Even when I was a kid, I was looking forward to going to my grandmother's house and running in my aunt's lockers.
Well, that was you on the Khanna, you almost got up with a theme park.
And then, as a dancer, I've always tried to pay attention to my dress.
You know, we dancers like to figure out our own style for hours and rehearsals to make us feel good when we look in the mirror.
And in the actress's role, you'll really be a match to your role when you get the costume.
You see, it's all connected to everything, and all my respect for designers and professionalism.
You've been celebrating your 30th birthday recently.
Oh, no.
I feel better than ever, I like the '30s.
I think that's how women really get, they've had enough experience, and they're making less mistakes in life.
The biological clock doesn't worry.
I've been doing what I want to do since I've been a kid, and it's got a lot of internal happiness.
And you want to be a mom or not?
Of course, I know that I'm a mother, because as a woman, I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss that.
As far as the future father is concerned, no matter who he is.
I'd like to raise my child in happiness and in great love.
Let's just say a few words about the movie, and last year, you filmed several movies that haven't even been introduced.
Yeah, and I'm looking forward to coming out.
I, the one who started the theater, am very impatient and restless, want everything right away, but of course I know it's impossible.
I can't wait to present the last hour and the search for the tomb of Christ.
I wonder what you're gonna say to them...
I understand you've been debuting on the runway with Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
No, no, that's not true.
I didn't go up on the runway as a model.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she just invited me to a charity fashion show in London that was organized by her own, a woman's organization for a better world. I chose two of her own Mango collections.
People don't even know how kind-hearted Naomi is.
There's so much they're putting together about it, so I know you, and I can make sure half of it's not true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of his activity.
He asked me for a noble cause for fashion show, but if he wanted me to stand in my head, I'll do it.
If the fate of women in the third world is at stake, I don't know the impossible.
The rebound drunk leaders will be required to install "Alcolock"
The Ministry of Home Affairs would be obliged to install a vehicle that would prevent the start of the vehicle if the driver was in a drunk state or not to blow it into the structure after three drunk driving violations.
The proposal was presented in June and is already being dealt with by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, according to which the pilot project will take a year.
As the project aims to restore the market, the car will have to participate in a repeated course on transport education.
In addition to the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Institute of Safety Technology (FITSA) also participate in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of car drivers arrested more than once after driving drunk are in the car again.
This would be hindered by the Alcolock, since the system connected to the vehicle establishes the level of alcohol in the air that is contained in it. If it is larger than allowed, or if the driver did not blow into the device at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of more than 1000 euro instruments would be borne by the controller.
A 2007 US study showed that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, this rule is estimated to save 115 people's lives every year.
The measure focuses on infringements for two reasons: it is easier, on the one hand, to prevent them from being criminal,
On the other hand, it is easier to introduce, as the implementation of the legal reform is carried out in the normal medium, while the necessary criminal reform needs to be amended as a basic law.
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which calls for the installation of the system in school buses - for the French model.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
In English, at the time announced in the program, 17 o'clock, Benito Juárez Airport, Mexico City, was landed in the Presidential hangar of Benito Juárez Airport, the Spanish Air Force, carrying Prince Asturias Party.
The sun was already down, but it was still so hot that we could only use our hands as a visualizer to see the royal party leaving the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other ranked personalities were standing.
A few hours before I asked a cab driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Prince's Party was coming to town for an official visit.
Oh, great, there won't be an airport transfer for a long time... from here to here or something.
No, no, no, sir, the lady in Spanish, she only lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or something.
But the Mexican press, and then it knows everything about the Prince of Asturias and the importance of their visit.
Many wait for the red carpets of the airport hangar, the occasion created by 27 sailors, who protect the dignity.
The Prince appears, smiling, in the blue clothing, and then the Princess gets in the long hair of the wind, in the back of the dress, but not in the usual shoes that shine on toes - they may have warned that Mexico City is threatened by a storm.
They stop for a moment and smile at the cameras and then enter the room where the official reception takes place.
At the gate of their hotel - one of the four largest hotels in the city - a reporter of one of the Mexican television flyers is waiting for them.
The most valuable fashion fee
To give a fashion fee, the best place in the world is without doubt Paris, and among the fashion designers who live today, the most sophisticated and coolest of all, Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second competition for the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims at the internationalisation of young fashion talent.
The main fee is EUR 300,000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first competition, saw his own design clothes in the window of the Boulevard Haussmann under 54, and he had little relief from power.
By the way, this is the second largest European business in Europe and recently opened at 1335 square meters.
The biggest deal is in London.
We finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris in the middle of the events and thanks to Valentino for the jury's presidency.
The president's table for the gala dinner made by Mango, along with the most interesting Chagalok, has shown us even more clearly.
Nati, who, due to her recent death, had a hard heart and sorrow, had a piece of the Company and some breathtaking jewels of ELAH. She accompanied Valentin with her son, who was nearly two metres tall, Luis, to the main table of dinner for honor.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, had fun with the guests. Rotchil bar, they were so knightly in college that they finally stayed undressed, because they both gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in her own design pants and shirts, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. At the night visit to the opera party at Gay Toledo, she got so stuck in the ballet room that she had the old times in her mind, she was in the middle of a row and a grand plie.
Inés Sastre didn't take part in the palace visit, but he showed some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning, we were able to enjoy Oliver Martinez - he's going to go with two meters high and a motorcycle - and John Travolta also arrived at the Intercontinent in Paris. He brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he said he didn't want any scents in the room.
Star stars under Paris' stars.
Oh, Ià, c'est la vie.
1001, stress resolution number
It's not 1000, it's 1000, and there's one way to turn off the chaotic and merciless everydays.
The good news is that we can find all of them in a single book that comes to the bookstore on September 30 to bring peace with you.
It's almost embarrassing at 7 a.m., but it's even worse to think about how speedy life is today's world.
The office's name is tension and the computer's back pain.
Stress is the population disease of the 21st century.
But dealing with daily fatigue and overcoming problems at work is not one or two ways.
No, this is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to yoga-positions, classic massages or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in his book so that everyone can find a solution that is most comfortable and adaptable to their free minutes.
The stress-restricted work carries the title of the 1001 relating method and the rest of it comes from Pearson Alhambra y DK to bookshops.
If you are convinced that the stress can hardly be overcome from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will certainly inspire you in your faith.
In addition, it also serves with other ideas that can help us all to relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% natural foods.
If it has become a central problem for the freshening of the body of adrenaline and for the stress, it is time to stay in the chair, relax and concentrate on reading.
Who speak in their dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and go completely alert about what happened to them that day, but those who talk during sleep.
The phenomenon may seem scary for the first time, but in fact it is completely harmless.
This good sleep disorder is called soniloquismus.
It's quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
They must have told more of them that he spoke at night.
With regard to its frequency, it can be totally practical (for example, only once in one case with a high fever) or more regular (at least once a week, once a week or once a month), and the child usually doesn't remember anything the next day.
Showing up cannot be returned to single outputs.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night-rare, night-baths (enuresis nocturna) or sleeptimes, but it is not lawful.
As has been said, it may be a condition with high fever, or a reaction to stress or increased anxiety.
In any case, until now, they have studied little.
The intensity of the speech is also very variable.
It may be quiet, calm, or inconsistency, but unlike all these, it may occur in the form of screaming, crying, or more long - suffering speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to monitor the child and the expert. The investigation may reveal whether there is a problem of great anxiety in the background and therefore a solution.
As has already been mentioned, it is a well - being phenomenon, and therefore there is no cure for it unless it is accompanied by another treatmentable form of sleep disorder (e.g. insomnia or stress).
But there are some things we can do, and here's a trick:
Let's see that the child remains calm before bed.
Choose relaxing games and avoid watching children look at scary or aggressive TV shows or series.
We teach children who are prone to nervousness or are more difficult to control, some relaxation methods to find inner rest.
This will help the child to sleep more calm.
If you start talking while you're asleep, we're trying to keep your rest.
Remember, this child is harmless, and the next day they won't remember anything.
Useful Counsellings
Do not wake the child.
It would be superfluous, because the kid's not conscious, but he'd run out of sleep.
Despite talking, he actually sleeps and rests.
Remember, if you have a strong anxiety that accompanys the phenomenon more often, it is advisable to turn to a specialist or explore what causes a great anxiety from the child.
If you speak plainly (this is a rare case), don't start asking questions to find out anything about it.
It would be unnecessary anyway, because when you sleep, you don't know how to get your thoughts together.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech, but you cannot see the dream images associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of what you have heard and with any conclusions.
Don't ever tell the kid that they can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not even for fun.
It's a very high anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it's just a few minutes of harmless episode.
Finally, Illhaeusern
After a long flight, Illhaeusern's team finally took a new boost and won back home.
Although there was no fergest game, the yellow blacks were repeatedly in position, one of which could eventually win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers had a hard time feeling the right rhythm.
The first gate was shot by the guest team captain, Kaufmann accompanied, but the remote ball just touched the upper corner of the gate tree. After that, Illhaeusern was in the top, and the shootings followed each other: Fonderflick tried to shoot with a remote shot, then Hirn's shot came over the gate. Romain was snipe, Diebold was also trying to force Dannemarie's protection.
On the other side, the players were packed in a block of defense on the middle track, and only Riahi, who was in a shooting position.
The beginning of the second half-life was critical: Riahi and Temporale were first in position on Dannemarie's side. Immediately after the first goal: Diebold's first shot, he got the blow-off ball by the excellent position of the éhaeuserni Marais, and then put it in the gate (53 minutes).
However, Illhausern’s goalner could not have long enjoyed the glory: he was forced to leave the field twelve minutes later, so his teammates had to go on fighting in a human race.
Dannemarie, however, could not take advantage of the advantage: they did not cause much trouble for the Hungarian team, who just pulled back a little bit to strengthen their defence. Only the last few seconds held some excitement when the ball was very close to the hood after a big load.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy puts a way to Bretagne.
On Monday, several breton and Normann ports were injured by demonstrations by fishermen. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with the representatives of the protesters.
The latter promised to receive the President in a "constructive spirit" and expressed their hope that Sarkozy's "specific proposals" would come.
The Presidential visit is at the same time as the meeting of the 'Paragraph Committee', which was established by breton fishermen to take action against the rise in gas oil prices, since the oil price exceeded the average price of the EUR 1.14 record per litre.
David Martinon, President of the Republic, said that "the president will discuss with fishermen what solutions could help companies to regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers".
The fishermen are determined to wait for Nicolas Sarkozy's arrival.
Tuesday morning, traffic slowing demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvatos county, causing almost 10 km of long congestion.
The traffic of Quiberon's yacht tie was also damaged, but the roads to Belle-île were not closed.
On the Quiberon Peninsula, roadblocks were planted.
On Monday, sailors have already witnessed their determination, then at dawn, tyres and pallets were lit before the fuel warehouses of the Brest ports, while demonstrations took place in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements at other ports of the Atlantic and La Manche. For example, fishermen in Vendée County did not board vessels in Sables d'Olonne, while some 20 ships in Le Havre prevented the traffic of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic in the region of Loire-Atlantique have eliminated the huge blockade of the Total oil refiner in Donges at night.
However, the fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for a Wednesday session to be held in the Ministry by decision on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the Committee should decide on its next move and participation at the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Commission, as the Committee did not support their efforts.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let you go to Paris", for example, stated Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorit Fisheries Commission.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes for gas oil currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but believe that the operation of a ship would only be profitable if the price of gas oil fell below EUR 0.30 per litre.
The wonderful Paul Newman
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid are an insatiable addressmaker in Connecticut's home at 83 years of age due to death, cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes, have also laid down their respect for the cinematographer and his profession, committed before Paul Newman when he was 83 years old.
Embraer does not change its 2008 transport plans
Despite the crisis threatening the global economy, the Brazilian airline company plans to land 215 aircraft this year.
The fourth largest airline company in the world, Embraer, can keep the plans and plan to launch 215 aircraft in 2008 - confirmed by Fredrico Fleury Curado, president of the company.
In the first semester, the company delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian manufacturing company is of great importance for the Chinese market, in particular for aircraft of 30-120 seats.
Embraer has delivered a total of 41 Chinese customers over eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company set up by the US financial authorities wants to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay $85 billion in advance - announced that the Financial Times was a dominant issue.
In addition to its international life insurance and US pension insurance activity, AIG would be responsible for almost all its other businesses - the paper, which provided close resources to the case.
According to the Times, the AIG Management Board met on Sunday evening to examine the possibilities for sales.
AIG didn't confirm this information.
The assets that AIG wanted to sell include the company's International League Financial Corp lease, the 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings, and its real estate portfolio and private equity investments - is added by the Times.
However, according to the paper, there is no final decision on sales.
AIG needs to be able to pay back the 85 billion-dollar loan approved by the US Government, taking the risk that it will have to lose its capital from 80% and lose its shareholders at an appropriate rate.
Paris Historique's study on the Morning Meeting's Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic decline on Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson's bank rescue plan. The Dow Jones Index fell by 6.98% (which has never seen a nearly 800 exact decrease), and Nasdaq fell by 9,14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) was down by 777,68 points, so 10 365,45 points were closed.
The largest decline in the index (684,81 points) has been registered on 17 September 2001 when trade was reinitiated after the terrorist attack on 11 September.
Nasdaq 199,61, based mainly on technological papers, was closed at 1,983,73 points, while the increased index of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 8,81% (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1 106,55 points according to official closing data.
The Wall Street Stock Exchange was already weak when it was opened, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the bank rescue plan to restore the market balance, it started flying deep.
With 228 'no' votes against 205 'yes', Members refused to provide the funds requested by Mr Paulson's Minister for Finance.
The plan was opened by the Republicans almost two thirds.
"In this market, the bad signs seem impossible to approve a plan," believes Lindsey Piegza, the FTN Financial Analyst.
"It seems to me that the market was expected of this plan," he added, and then expressed his concern that if they adopted such a plan a few days later, it would be "too late".
"If the plan is truly condemned to death (...), then the Fed (American Central Bank - the Serk.) and the other central banks will be in line to deal with the crisis, and the credit conditions will continue to tighten" - warns Brian Bethune, head of Global Insight.
To further increase the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: "all day long, another financial institution is going bankrupt" in the United States.
After the Washington Mutual on Friday's bankruptcy, the authorities made sure that the bank business of Wachovia was purchased by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, which required emergency measures to save banks in the UK, Benelux states, Iceland and Germany. It indicates that the market is not only a US crisis, but also a global financial analyst for FTN.
The bond market has been significantly increased.
The 10-year government bond yield decreased from 3.827% on Friday evening to 3.632% and fell from 4.357% on the previous day to 4.161%.
Obama won the first television match.
On Fridays of the two American presidential candidates, his first debate was followed by another one that had to decide that John McCain or Barack Obama would be a winner.
Not surprisingly, both the leaders of the Republican and the Democratic campaign have said that victory is a victory in the television party followed by a third of the American households.
According to the political analyst David Gergen, although John McCain's action was respectable, it did not prove to be sufficiently "supervisive" to stop his popularity from falling: this is evidence of five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democrat candidate is more involved in the fight: according to the results of the public opinion poll published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49%).
According to 39% of those questioned, Obama will win, while 25% of them will expect McCain to win, according to a survey conducted by CBS.
Obama is expected to continue to increase his advantage with his partner Joseph Biden's promise to be great Thursdays. Biden is preparing his first and only public debate with Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned me this weekend: "It would be great to underestimate Palin.
He's got good instincts."
McCain, who has been in his 70s, has never been advocating its own, undisputed foreign policy experience. However, she stresses her opposition to 'navitation' in these questions, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
"It seems Senator Obama doesn't understand that..." said the attack several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary for the presidential position," said McCain.
This is the main attack surface, which has been used by Republican TV advertisements since yesterday.
Obama, however, placed the emphasis on representing the future.
He didn't allow himself to be confused: he'd come together, he'd put it right.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore the picture of the United States in the world.
"McCain still fails to understand, however, Obama has already "cut back the democracies this weekend, which puts the Republican leader in his eyes that he still has not measured the impact of the crisis on the American "outca people".
"In ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama in front of twenty thousand people who gathered together in the rain of North Carolina for the election meeting.
He didn't even mention the words "medium" or "workers" on his mouth. The confusion in the financial world undoubtedly favours Obama, the one that Americans think is best placed to save the economy at the edge of the collapse.
"The next seven turning points may be" said Charles Schumer, the powerful Democrat senator.
According to Mr Rahm Emanuel's Democrat, one of the veterans of the Clinton Government has the Obama "in the field of the economy with great incentives" such as Bill Clinton during the financial crisis in 1998.
In the eyes of the President-in-Office of Democracy, the current crisis is "the final judgment over the bad economic policy over eight years, which George Bush has created with Senator McCain's support".
Senator Ilinisi reaffirmed that despite stock exchange fluctuations, the tax burden of 95% of Americans will be reduced. He added that its primary objectives include the creation of potential energy independence in the country through the use of renewable energy sources and the development of a health insurance system.
McCain is planning to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates were very careful about the banking rescue plan of USD 700 billion (EUR 470 billion): the very unpopular plan was adopted by the Congress last night.
Minsk: "Did you notice that there was a election here?"
On Sunday night, young people and opponents protested at the capital of Belarus to reject the expected outcome of parliamentary elections.
On Sunday night following the closing of the polls, several hundred Belaruss gathered in Minsk's main area to protest against the falsification of election results.
Although they have not yet published results, many young protesters against President Alexandr Lukasenko say, "Dictator, give up."
Some people admit that they didn't even go to vote, "Why would I go?
The protestors do not believe that the regime, which was trying to describe itself in a good way before foreign observers in order to establish contact with the European Union, would be ready to change a democratic system.
If the elections were to be cleared by observers, they could break up sanctions against the country in which 40 Belarusian leaders refused the visa and some bank accounts were frozen.
According to the opposition, however, the elections did not take place clearly.
"We were held by the electoral committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the polls" - regretted Jurii Potyemkin, organised by the twelve parties, thus being the spokesperson of a very heterogeneous United Democratic Forces coalition.
"The changes were just nominal" - stressing Aleksandr Milinkievics, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and the leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is, who is counting the votes, and in our case, this executive power.
If the opposition's delegates get into this Parliament, it means they've been appointed, not elected.
But their access to the Parliament will allow them to have a place on television, to sit in the regions of the country and to submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore take the scene in political life, because 'the dialogue with the European Union must begin'.
Because if our economy with Russia is going into a crisis and we are not able to do it again, we risk being under the rule of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the European Organisation for Security and Cooperation following the election process will accept the outcome of the vote as valid.
They stress that the participation rate seems to be too high, and the widespread organisation of the prior vote ( 26% of voters in Minsk) has enabled any manipulation.
"You have noticed that the election was taking place here?" - asks the leader of the Social Democrat Alekszandr Kozulin, who was released last in August this year with the last release from prison, where he was held a political prisoner.
No one was in the polls.
And there will be up to five opposition Members in this Parliament, namely those who are most in line with leadership.
At October Square, the silence of the night will come again.
In television, President Lukasenko and members of the Central Election Commission enjoy their success.
It's safe to have blood again
The tenth anniversary of the foundation of Hema-Québec was celebrated yesterday.
Most importantly, he managed to regain people's confidence, which was seriously undermining the effects of the blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As known, national blood reserves managed by the Red Cross blood supply service in Canada have been infected with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general upheaval, the Canadian Government launched an official investigation under Judge Horace Krever in February 1994.
While Judge Krever was late reporting, a few provinces set up their own committee to design a new system of blood treatment for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee has performed this task.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood supply services were established in Canada: one is the Québece Service, Hema-Québec, and the other is the Canadian Relief Society responsible for the supply of all other provinces and the two territories.
"When Héma-Québec started its activity in 1998, almost 38% of people had confidence in Québec's blood supply system," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was dire.
"In the coming years, however, we managed to regain people's confidence as a result of improving the safety of blood products and of our work in the area." Décary proudly states that at the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of the people of Quebec were confident about Hema-Québece.
Dr. Décary, however, does not forget that "trust is a very fragile thing".
Since the establishment of Hema-Québec on 28 September 1998, it has applied the precautionary principle.
During this period a number of cases have been discovered in Europe where the mild bovine disease, namely Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, has also infected people with its new variants, tell the doctor who has been managing the company since its founding in 1998.
"We had no reason to believe that this disease was spreading through blood.
We therefore rely on one of the most important recommendations of Krever and Gélineau reports. Therefore, if we are uncertain and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, we must take exclusion measures. In this case, it was Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which causes the brain to change and thus inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from persons who have spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
A few years ago, no doubt has been found that the disease is spread through blood.
This case has convinced us that it has made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that allows a much more sensitive diagnosis of the HIV virus; this is the nucleic acid test (NAT), which is able to detect the virus directly in the blood of the blood donors, and not the antibodies against the virus, for which the tests used previously were built.
With the help of the NAT test, we could shorten the window tradition, which lasts from infection until we can show the virus through our technical tools in the blood - explains the expert.
This period was reduced to a shorter period than one week.
Thus, there was a significant reduction in the risk of blood donors being infected outside of our knowledge and that they could not be detected.
These improvements have greatly reduced the risk of transmission of AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of getting blood infected with HIV virus is 12 million to one.
"In other words, this means that we should distribute 12 million blood products until someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400-500 thousand blood products every year, it should be over 24 years for such a case to occur and someone to be infected with HIV virus through a blood product.
I think that you can accept it now, or you can write blood transfusions to restore your health - set up by the First Leader of Hema-Québec.
"The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We'll never know what new pathogen goes into the system.
It only happened last year that the Chikugunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Niles virus, enters the blood with a insect bite.
That is why we need to keep on moving," Dr. Décary continued, and then stressed that, apart from the emergency reserves, Hema-Québec had to provide sufficient permanent reserves.
"The demand for an ageing population is also increasing.
Since anti-cancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also affects the population of blood donors, as the number of people on the network who are able to give blood represents only 3% of the population in Quebec.
However, every healthy person, at least 18 years of age, may give blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
Applicants do not accept blood on average from 14%, for example, because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been in a country where malaria is destroyed are not eligible for blood transfusion for a year.
"That means we have enough reserves to satisfy the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare that we're out of stock.
However, we need to increase the number of blood donors to the extent that the existing ones grow old, because after some time they can't give blood anymore.
But it is very difficult to convince people to give blood, but it is even more difficult to keep them and to make them become regular blood donors.
In this today's running world, there's hardly a single hour for a man to give blood," he's sorry about Francine Décary.
Hema-Québec, a budget of $297 million, provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart pumps, eyeballs, and skin tissue, which are used almost exclusively for people who have been severely burned.
These tissues are analyzed, converted and frozen and then placed at Hema-Québec, which also treats the single public stem cell of Quebec.
The hair can only be obtained from colostrum treated as medical waste, which allows treatment of severe diseases (e.g. leukemia) in the stem cells.
"We've been celebrating for several weeks that we've been in our bank for the thousands of colossal blood samples, and we're planning to take over thousands of new samples a year.
At the beginning of next year, we are probably already starting to offer these for organ transplants," said Dr. Décary, who thinks the colossal blood take-out program is very popular today.
"A lot of moms are sad because they don't have a chance to do that" - that's true, because Hema-Québec has no way of making this complex and costly program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Sheeping - the Impact in the top
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounderst by 3:1 yesterday on the U.S.L-1 screen, and reached the front end with the overall result 4:3. This was the second quarter-final match, which took place in Saputo's stadium.
The final goal was Antonio Ribeiro's mid-track match in 90 minutes.
While it was not the first half-time goal, in the second, the montreal team found two middle-fields David Testo and Rocco Plancentino in the enemy's bedroom.
Roger Levesque was the only one on the Sounders team who managed to play Matt Jordan.
Let us remember that the first match on Friday was the defeat of the Impact 2:1 from Starfire Complex in Stockholm, out of Seattle.
Impact plays with the Vancouver Whitecaps at the top.
Saturday night, the Thunder team in Minnesota, who won from Whitecaps at 3:1 in the first game, won at 4:3, yet Whitecaps entered the foreman with a total result of 5:4.
The Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the match are still specified today.
Dóhejéj - winning goal of Kovalev
The Canadian's favorite trisa is waiting for another season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn formed three great attacks, and eventually the Canadiens won the Florida Panthers 3:2 ratios from the crime attacks in the Centre Bell last night.
Kostitsyn, number one star of the meeting, got a goal. Plekanec two, Kovalev closed the game with a goal pass, which was the fourth victory of the team's six preparatory games.
The match was decided by Kovalev who got the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," warns the Russian player.
"I need another game to make me feel really good."
"He tried too much to get me out of you in the first three." He noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think the end result of the game was happy.
He's got a huge oscillation."
Lake Charest's efforts
The Prime Minister doesn't rule out that this year's election will start.
It is hardly the end of the meeting of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest, who already went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new minister of health, Yves Bolduc (left side) breaks to victory at the interim elections to take place today.
"Resisting our last big northern border": Jean Charest set this ambitious long-term goal at the meeting of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis yesterday. The speech was enriched with visual elements, while the president tried to focus on the point.
During the presentation, behind his back they drew lines similar to "Moulin à images".
The three huge projectors followed each other: dams of water plants, mining, Quebec on "Google Maps", maps...
Such spectacular tools are used during election periods.
The Prime Minister, by the way, refused to guarantee at the press conference that the election would not start this fall, although he added that its time allocation was very tight.
The "early plan" is the fourth pillar of the "water" of Prime Minister Quebec's future, which is being established in a "new economic area". It is a labour convention with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and includes several agreements designed by Ontario.
Recently, opening up to the North (i.e. the north area starting at 49 degrees of width) has often been included in the Prime Minister's speeches but has never held a presentation on this subject.
However, the Head of State was simply concerned that he explained why he considered the North as "a treasure mine full of great potential". He did not, however, talk about time factor, investment amounts or a specific order of importance for future projects.
Only a few development opportunities have been raised: primarily water plants, forestry and in particular mining, which are further enhanced by the growth of the countries in the contagion and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
In the north, Charest was classified as nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond.
This is an area that is "two times as large as France", "the territory of our territory, the territory of Quebec.
The Head of State has repeated not only of us but also of us, stressing that this would create a national founder myth.
He pointed out that Québec's development was largely determined by his relationship with the North: the golden lair in Abitib, the Quebec designer, James Bay...
"It's our future", he added after a time of color, and he's considered a huge map behind his back.
The 70% North of Quebec's territory includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always asked itself, has been reported by the Prime Minister at the press conference.
"This is our historical resolution, confirmed by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, if there is time, I reaffirmed the same resolution on behalf of the government".
On the other hand, "In the light of climate change, we must also reconsider our position on the North," said the Prime Minister, speaking about the Northern Cross, which opens up every year as a result of the melting of Arctic ice.
According to the Prime Minister, the reservation of the area in this new geopolitical environment is an important task.
And what about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would pay particular attention to them, and that the plan would bring many benefits, especially for young people.
Two ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (later of the Party Québécois ungavai), have already begun the consultation with about thirty local associations.
Benoît Pelletier was also led by the Intergovernmental Committee, in which Julie Boulet (minister of Transport and Natural Resources) played an important role.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, "not necessarily a summit", where "joint water" is created.
The development of the North would otherwise be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan is coordinated, integrated and environmentally friendly", promised by the Prime Minister.
Jean Charest described this "water" as in line with the ideas of the pre-eminent liberal prime ministers.
"As well as previous liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from challenges."
This was, by the way, one of the returning topics of the weekend that began with the big cocktail party that celebrates Jean Lesage's election as a party party.
One of the decisions adopted suggests that the Beauharnois plant be crossed into Adélard-Godbout dam.
"The politicians of our country, including Godbout, the Godbout, the founder of Hydro-Québece, the quiet revolution and the national distribution of water power plants, or Bouras, known as the father of James Bay, knew how to create the future," Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he quoted another program called "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Regarding the plan of the Eastmain1a-Ruper Water Force dam, President Charest stressed that the deployment will be planned for 2012.
"This should be between us, but I'm planning to be there," he explained to his believers, and he accepted his statement a loud wallpaper.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no choice in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote to be held this fall, which the law will also allow for it.
However, he stressed that his calendar was already full, as he took tasks at the Federal Council meeting in China and at the Québec-New York Summit.
The party meeting at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the President of the Liberals to express nationalist decisions, which have been approved almost without thought. This is mainly about the 'objectives': the fact that the Liberal Party is a special character of 'Québec' in the Constitution.
I would also like Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and these members to have the right to vote in Quebec.
The opposition, however, received the main points of the Northern Plan sceptically.
The leader of Parti Québécois, Paulina Marois, has re-enacted the development policy of North Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, in 2003, the liberal government has been powerless to apply this policy.
If they hadn't done it, "this would have been a long way forward," said Mrs Marois in agreement with Mrs Françoise Mercure, who was the candidate for today's Jean-Talon vote.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government's acceptance of the Northern Plan.
"We would, however, like this not to be a mere game of play" - noted the leader of Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont returning from his freedom today.
Letters - A Conquered Country
Mr Vic Toews, Minister of Harper Kabinet (a.k.a. Minister of Justice) took the courage to call LouiseArbourt Canada "a shame" last summer.
So to reproach a woman who fought for justice and deserves all of our wonders, this tells us a great deal about people around the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
That is why this is our government, which, among the Western countries concerned, did not deliver home its own citizens from the Guantanaamo concentration camp.
This is the government, which absolutely does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the crime he committed.
It's the only government that, even though Canada signed the Geneva Convention, refused his word and allowed a child soldiers to climb under inhuman circumstances.
The only government who's making a puppet theater out of justice while investigating the guilt of a defendant.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and Canadian lawyers are also demanding the return of Omar Khadr to Canada for a fair trial.
And our government's eye on the cakes: it doesn't matter to him that a young adult has been completely destroyed by spirit, and many years of torture is likely to put his fate to death.
Although we are not yet aware of this, our rights, our freedom and our democracy are currently undermining. "Democracia": Harper puts this word at an incestuous level, which sounds just empty out of his mouth.
The time has come, then, when morals no longer exist: they can self-sufficiently beat, torture and imprison any Canadian citizen, in the interest of a leader of a government that has been in a minority until now (and what can be done after 14 October?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found at a party that boasts of virtue, the Law, and the Order. They do not see that this government is uplifting the values that our country could have due to the good news and dignity of our country.
Dear Toews, the shame is more this - not elsewhere.
Opinion - The Barrick Gold orwell vocabulary
A letter was published in Le Devoir's 17th September from Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director-General Barrick Gold of Canada.
As a result of Orwell's development, Garver states that the world's largest gold-producing company has launched six million dollars in defamation proceedings against three authors and a small-scale company for the initiative of a 'public debate'.
Although judges are independent and unbiased, their decision - especially in the defamation proceedings - is not brought by the truth, but by law.
It's not surprising that Garver was deeply listening to this basic difference.
Would Barrick Gold really be the best way to make a public debate destroy anyone whose position is contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada must spend substantial amounts of protection and combat in an uneven fight where lawyers supported by almost unexpressed resources in the mining industry are on the other side.
In such an unbalanced fight, the tactics are often used to destroy the defendant and make a friendly agreement that not only silences the opposite but also fears those who would try to renegotiate the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views before the public opinion.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold is engaged, this is otherwise happening, in Canada, the dispute parties usually do not run into each other with a scandal, but they say their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have had enough to open its books and dossiers and prepare for a real debate in a press, media, publications, paying independent research groups that could have found light on the question.
But it seems that Barrick Gold does not trust the public opinion, and with a move it does not duplicate applications and letters written in the defense of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can initiate a 'public' debate if, at the same time, he ignores the opinion of this public?
In the Vice-President's head, this word is probably just lawyers paid on the bus and not Canada's entire lives: the meaning of the concept is so narrow.
In a democratic state, even others are eligible for freedom of speech.
Barrick Gold, however, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are primarily in favour of the public because it condemns the cruel course of the mine.
The public is ready to listen to Barrick and make a judgment, but based on civilized arguments, and not on a case for many people to be heard. (In the context of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold recently asked the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this expression.)
In addition to the surreal development of Garver, Barrick Gold's procedure is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of every democratic society.
As a whole, it denies the right to quote credible resources, to discuss facts and interpretations which form the basis of spiritual activities.
If a country like Canada can only study and discuss issues that do not like the rich companies of today's world, who will take the courage to do this?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it could be done according to the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has the right to answer.
In our university circle, we have been able to handle disputes, differences of opinion and conflicts for a long time.
Barrick Gold's ill-advised procedure shows that, unlike his claim, he has no interest in having an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the Canadian public debate institutions, and it is time that governments finally put in place measures that limit legal procedures for such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue - Convenient for Democrats and Republicans
The leaders of the Bush Government and Congress Republican and Democrat finally agreed yesterday on an economic rescue mission, which has been the largest economic global plan since the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan, which aims to cover the financial crisis on Wall Street for months, has yet to be approved by the two houses of Congress.
Important points of the plan: more effective control of implementation by Members; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of pre-planned public funds; new provisions to maintain the number of houses occupied due to default; access rights to the payment of the management of the assisted companies.
Henry Paulson, U.S. Secretary of Finance, Nancy Pelosi, President of the American Parliament and Judd Gregg, the Republican representative in the trial yesterday, announced the good news a few minutes before midnight after the two-day marathon trial was concluded.
"We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively on the markets" said Henry Paulson, representative of the Bush government.
"We have done everything in our power to save the real economy and American citizens from the current crisis on Wall Street," he explained.
"The most important point is that if we don't do this, then the shock, chaos and confusion in the everyday lives of the Americans," said Judd Gregg, a Republican representative.
The trial was accelerated in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would have an adverse impact on the mood of investors.
The agreement was signed by the stock exchange until the opening of the morning.
Two candidates who joined the negotiations late showed willingness to reach an agreement, however, are not happy with the fact that the situation was finally increased.
Senator Barack Obama was responsible for extending the agreement to elements such as the preservation of house ownership or the payment of payments to managers of state-aid companies.
"When we ask taxpayers to take some extraordinary steps on account of the irresponsibleness of other people, it is not too pleasant.
These steps, however, are necessary" - noted on an American television show.
And when John McCain asked another channel about whether he would vote on the proposed plan, he said: "I would like to know the details, but I hope so."
"What I read in large lines is already seen as something that we all must digest, and through which we can move forward.
The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable," he said.
According to the 700 billion plan, taxpayers' money would buy the dual claims of the US financial institutions, some unsoldable assets that they put at risk.
The plan was prevented by a crisis of 14 months, initiated by the depreciation of the real estate loan. This first led to the collapse of ventured real estate loans (second mortgage loans) and then spread to other debt securities (trade) and, finally, to the freezing of liquid assets and to the breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican Members failed the first draft agreement last week.
It seems we've managed to get out of this dead end since the Democrats have agreed that certain 'toxic' tools of companies in difficulty are only guaranteed by the government rather than purchased by it.
In order to be satisfied with all the members of Congress, a provision has also been introduced which provides that if the government has to bear losses for five years within the framework of the programme, it may impose new taxes in order to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion instalment would first be paid; it could be followed by another $100 billion if the President deems necessary.
The remaining 350 billion dollars should be approved by Congress with another vote.
In exchange for help, Washington acquires shares in the assisted companies through which profits are distributed and which can be sold after the crisis has been reduced.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the reservation of mortgage loans covered by the plan, and may also set the maximum value of wages and end-assurance for managers of companies affected by the crisis.
The authors of the plan would like the plan to be voted today by the House of Representatives and the Senate on Wednesday.
However, despite their efforts, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
Since yesterday, protests against the plan were repeated among both Republicans and Democrats.
"It is quite clear that Washington will not hear your voice" - said the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the financial committee of the house.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no one that would favour taxpayers."
Brad Sherman, a representative of the Democratic Democrat Group, called the "Septic Group", presents things differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"Fifty excellent economic experts, including three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us to ask for Congress: don't hurry, and look carefully at which way he chooses", said Sherman yesterday.
At the same time in Europe, it was once again understood that this is a global crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they would State part of the Fortis banking group at EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg has become necessary after the announcement by BNP Pabaris, not to purchase his competitors on the edge of the bankruptcy after the loss of EUR 2 million (EUR 2.9 billion) due to the crisis of US secondary mortgage loans.
With Fortis's 85 000 employees, twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurance companies are one of them.
"It's not thrown away money" said yesterday, Minister of Finance of Wouter Bos.
"In exchange we will obtain voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of La Manche, the British Government seems to be preparing for a new bank, which has been hit by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over the total amount of ongoing loans from Bradford and Bringley bank, of which the real estate accounts for USD 41 billion ( USD 75.5 billion).
The Spanish Santander bank announced yesterday that they would purchase British bank subsidiaries and client holdings.
Bradford and Bringley, after this Northern Rock, would be the second bank that the British government has wanted to state since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Goodbye to the actor server
According to some, the eyes of the beautiful Azerke were the main batter card, and others thought it was the main weakness.
Did you ever get rid of the mirror of nárciss by a yellow-eyed American actor?
Yeah, I didn't.
Through his shame, tenderness, and the gift he had born, he was also away from the harsty style, which is the essence of the true great works of the art world.
But what a huge race!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer at 83 years of age on Friday at the Connecticut estate, and he was one of the last icons of the American movie flower.
There was less monumental personality than Brando, who was like him, and who was considered to be a rival for a long time on the film screen. He was more remanded and undoubtedly vulnerable in his books, but he also declared freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mixing of blood is often caused by exceptional children.
Newman was born in 1925 as a child of German Jewish father and Hungarian mother of origin in Ohio.
European roots contributed to the birth of a symbolic form of American dream.
He didn't think much about himself, which just increased his merit.
In the early 1950s he studied at Yale University's drama and then at Aktor's Studio in New York before the theater, television and shortly later broke into the world of cinema.
Besides being a live warrior of civil rights, he was second in 1979 as a motor racing driver on the 24-hour race of Le Mans. He was also considered a sexist, although he had a happy marriage to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we'll never know what shades they've had on the lives of this mysterious, locked-out actor who hated the show-business platter, and it's always a mystery.
He was a man of truth, in the most common sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman at the end of the week has been shocking the cinemas: in his great roles only we can see on the black screen of memories.
Looking through the art of life, the seventh American art, the cinema, has been revised for more than fifty years.
It is recalled that "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" are a yellow cowboy (1969) and his emotional wife (Elyzabeth Taylor) were caught in the work of Tennessee Williams in the role of "The Cat on the Hot Wing" in 1958.
From recent times (1990) we can remember in Mr. Bridge’s sensitive image who is faced with the fact that his marriage did not replace his hope.
Paul Newman has also seen a lot of other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise's film "Valaki Up", the unforgivable role played by a violent criminal boxer, Rocky Graziano, was originally intended for James Dean - and after his death - launched Newman's acting career in 1956.
He also played a sympathic criminal in the brilliant creation of "The Big Claw", which won Oscar for the best film in 1973.
Robert Rossen, in his genius film "The Svindler" (1961), created a bitter, recompensive billion player and returned to his film Martin Scorse in a similar role, "The Color of Money" in 1987.
It's changing times, but it's always the same face: it's him.
It's always been like that.
The period of his career was marked by changes in time.
The younger ones are known mainly from George Roy Hill's cult film "The Icebreakers" (1977), where Reggie Dunlop plays a group of ice-crackers that is not a coach with standard methods.
His family saw him in "The Great Jump", recorded by Coen brothers in 1994.
The film Sam Mendes closed in 2003: this was the last time he showed up in the role of a Irish mafia boss.
Unlike many cinematographers, who left the movie mask relatively quickly, Newman stayed in the reflector for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with its glare, light and visualization.
The French film director Bertrand Tavernier did not see any humor as "a living cáfolat of underplay": he thought his game was too powerful.
The profession, however, was not always kind to Paul Newmann, who for a long time had only fallen into his lap with movie characters.
Yet, young and successful characters were less likely to play: rather, they had developed neurotic, alcoholic, malignant, or hopeful figures, who were able to give back their drifting and rebellion with perfect credibility.
As a director, Newman showed a less well-known face: a very eyey and sensitive man in his soul.
In 1968, a film entitled "Rachel, Rachel" (which was adopted by the Canadian writer Margaret Laurence) by Joanne Woodward, a good portrait of a melancholy woman.
With the film "Harry and his son" of 1984, he said to his son Scott, who died of drug overdose.
Yesterday's countless admirers of Newman's actor. A close friend and old warrior Robert Redford (who played in "The Big Claw" and "The Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid"), he said, "The existence of his family made my life better and the world better.
The joy of generosity and being: this was the vibrating personality of this great actor, whom we have just lost.
In addition to legend's career, his comments on civil rights, the environment, the fight for independent film production and Hollywood's balconies are dire.
We've seen her picture smile on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods many times.
However, income from such sales has always been referred to as the foundation established for children with disease.
Newman never sat on his bakery: he's always committed to his profession.
In his letter to his five daughters, he wrote the following words: "Your father has always and always been unimaginably grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here."
It is also a privilege for us to walk along the course of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a citizen, above all.
What were they producing in Zuschlag & Tsai’s account office?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial of the criminal proceedings against John Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
Politicians and their partners are accused of fraud and other crimes which are particularly serious damage to the criminal system and which have been committed in a commercial and commercial manner, including, among other things, in the case of judicial detection.
According to the prosecutor, the tender funds received were used for their own purposes and the performance of the tasks was often proven with unreal invoices.
In total, some 65 million forints in government and local government money - were taken to the Cassa of the Young Left, partly in the pocket of certain persons.
The method described by the investigating authority was that the tender money received was collected on the basis of cost accounts that were not carried out in real terms, and the associations have never complied with the obligation undertaken.
According to the prosecution, most of the bills were fake.
To these, the city market acquired the numbers, and the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskuhala.
And what would happen to the name of the companies is that of the account production, including on the outskirts of Lake Zuschlag, to which István Lados sent.
According to the latest statement, she had to look at some friends and restaurants.
He requested an invoice of his consumption, which was then modelled on, inter alia, the Youth and Sport Ministry, the social and labour register and the accounts to be submitted for applications by the Government of the Capital.
In most cases, Stephen Lados noted these with his partner, Mr. Vári, who, according to our information, wrote most of the reports that were needed to receive the aid.
One of Lados' study trips was a beer house.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlagék in 2003, the guesthouse provided a meal for the nineties of the team of the Commissioner Pont Association.
However, so far, according to the corporate manager, they would not have been able to access the guesthouse at the same time.
Similarly, for the Better Future - later together with the Third Year Foundation - he was piling out of the form and content errors of the invoice issued in summer 2002.
Because there was only three rooms in the bank, more than ten people couldn't sleep in it one night, but the account was still about a hundred and thirty guests.
But it was too late for fantasizing print chargers even when Pigal Kft. was also mentioned, which was also recorded in the accounts, according to the information given to the prosecution, was not included in the documents relating to the Right Future and the name of Hoppa.
The company's manager, Győr Farkas told him that when he was called in and invoiced to the D.A., he knew it was false documents.
"Our company's name and tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp."
He added that, beyond the formal reasons, hundreds of people have been rented, because they have a total of eleven rooms in which there is not so much room.
In addition, the account was also about food, while their restaurant was no longer working.
The zealists did not follow the fact that the travel agency in Budapest, which they look like, only organises foreign trips, so it was marked as a service on the cash account in Hungary, which also did not agree with the company's accounting practices.
In addition, as has been found in the investigation, there was also a case in the document where travel to countries outside the European Union was free of VAT.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was wrong with four documents issued by Hotel Réffföf Kft. for the Right Future, since the service of the company is not charged with the designated 25, but with 15 percent VAT, while the hotel's employees only issued a machine bill, while the account was hand-made.
In addition, the 'discriminates' were also destroyed by the fact that road freight transport was designated as an activity carried out by a company, through the prosecution procedure, which was not carried out by the company based on the initial investment advice.
In addition, formal deviations - an inadequate form of account, not real stamps - have emerged because, together, the accounts of the Third Year Foundation, the 21st century Cultural Association and the Commissioner Point are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sports Camp in U.S., whose representatives refused to issue the accounts.
For example, the counterfeiters did not listen to the fact that HIB Kft. was in liquidation at the time when he was eating for the Young City Association at the time of his death (2001), and that is why the company's clearing officer, as we know, denied that he would have issued the paper.
They made it known.
The other group of account issuers is composed of those who were aware that they had to issue a fiscal account.
For Esély Budapest, the Foundation has issued an invoice for the Third Year Foundation at the request of the Young Socialists - Young.
According to the prosecution, one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, has put him in charge of issuing a fiscal account.
She also cooperated with Zuschlagék on the Biogate Ltd under liquidation, which in 2003 had the Better Future Foundation, the Atlas Association and the Red Riding Association, with a gross value of HUF 5 million, which was not a real economic activity.
No money movement, because the bills they had prepared were taken out, but these organizations have already forgotten to present them in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing the invoice belongs to those that can be linked to the defendants.
Thus, Iván Kubatov was not the managing officer of Delta Trió Kft. who was established in Budapest for the sale of fuel and motor vehicles.
The company has issued several invoices for the sale of IT equipment in October, November and December 2005, worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these accounts were purchased by Cash Investment Ltd., which had been eliminated since 14 September 2005.
This company was the CEO of a Romanian man who would also have forwarded the company's documents between 2002 and 2005.
We understand that in the course of the investigation Kubatov acknowledged that he had issued an invoice to Atlas, Hoppa and the Third Year Foundation on behalf of Kft, and he accepted their countervalue.
In particular, at the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian stone mills were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Fapari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies really worked, which the defendant said was the reason they didn't get a job.
However, it was beneficial for businesses, because at the request of Saint Zsolt, who produced the documents of the defendants, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the Zuschlag Associations: Atlas and Y-Generation.
Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave the organizations a total of 15 invoices for HUF 14,2 million.
The prosecutor considered that 10 percent of the amounts recorded in the accounts and the VAT hit Kubatov's mark.
The man also used Si-Beri Bt. to issue sound accounts, and they were manufactured for Commissioner Pont's tender.
The Y-Generation and the Association submitted a tender for Modern Hungary in January 2006 for the socialist party's public benefit organisation, the Dances Mihály Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500-500 000 HUF, but the amounts were not used for the purposes of the tender.
In order not to reveal that, five Philistine accounts received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These accounts were found, by the way, during a house search at Kemecse Árpád's office at the educational register.
Some of the defendants in the trial, as did at the D.A., are likely to report on the course of account production.
The most interesting thing is that if you are the first defendant, János Zuschlag will decide that you will notice everything.
His testimony so far is not too detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak in detail, he has not yet done so.
The question is, perhaps, that most of the damage, 50 million forints in the head of compensation, have been negotiated with the socialists, and Zusi takes the fall.
Anyone who may have been offended by the fact that his requests for home detention were constantly found in deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of far greater damage and non-reparable economic crimes can walk freely or at least wait in their own homes for the end of the current procedure against them, they have no possibility of doing so.
Psychology of overlisting: Why are we giving out more money?
In auctions, buyers tend to issue more money, overvalue goods.
The neuro-economic foundations of this known - and apparently irrational - behaviors of the New York University have been discovered by neurologists and economists.
According to their study in Science magazine, people do not want to go down in a type of competition, such as eBay's auction, so they pay too high prices.
The research has been trying to map this "play" nervous theme through experimental auctions.
One of the volunteers participated in a lottery auction in another group of players, while the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method examined the active brain areas of experimental individuals.
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but during the auction game - in which the other party's overlisting element - the sub-striatum complex called the stratium, has moved in intensively when the game is lost.
This brain field plays a part in the nervous system's "remuneration" mechanism in addition to several other functions.
Researchers therefore believe that the price is explained by avoiding a sharp reaction to the striatum.
In support of their theory, a financial follow-up study was carried out by members of the research group.
In these three groups, they've limited a partner against a partner under different circumstances.
The control group simply explained the real value of the product in question and they made their bets.
In addition, another group was promised that if they were out of play, they would earn another $15.
However, the third group received 15 dollars before the auction, but the members of the group lost this money in case of losing auction.
The difference between the two groups was therefore only that one of them had been given the emphasis on winning and the loss for them.
However, by demonstrating the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the "loss" team were willing to make higher stakes than the control and strength groups.
"These results cannot be derived from the theory of any previously existing economy.
They have always explained the effects of auctioning only with the joy of winning and risk-absorbing.
Only the neurological imaging methods helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories so that we have now reached a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economic Development at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we go to a doctor?
About half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, the leading causes of death mention chronic liver disease.
Hundreds of thousands of people infected with home hepatitis may be treated, but only seven thousand people are treated for this reason: patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name of the hepatitis is collected by the name of various viruses caused by infectious liver cancers.
Their symptoms have a lot of similarities, characterised by inflammation of the liver and yellowness, but are pathogens and the diseases caused are different from each other.
The hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the nutrient channel (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (difficulty, vaginal fluid, mucous membrane).
Travelers should be protected by vaccination against A and B virus, with no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis Two to three weeks after consumption of infected food are generally associated with malnutrition, weakness, abdominal complaint, nausea.
After this, the yellowness on the skin and eyes whites, the stools are clear, the urine is dark, healing can take two to three weeks.
A million people die worldwide in the more severe type of disease, liver cancer caused by hepatitis B and liver glucose.
The main reason for this is that only every tenth of the infected patients are estimated to receive medication.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to hepatic impairment, liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease, because the pathogen destroys their liver cells sublimely, in many cases only in 20-30 years.
It is therefore very important to prevent early, to conduct regular screening tests.
In three groups, this disease is much more than average: people undergoing transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
The number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is currently 200 million in the world.
As the disease may already be detected by a routine laboratory test, it is worth turning to a doctor when any symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
In time, recognising the disease can be cured, the virus can be removed from the body, thus eliminating fertility and preventing cancer from formed.
September 30th is the worldwide day of hepatitis, first organised in 2004 by patient organisations throughout the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, to the causes of development and to the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God, does it hurt any less?
According to recent research, religious faith works as a kind of painkiller, which could have made it easier for Catholic martyrs to die.
Scientists at Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment, examining the way in which divineism affects people’s sense of pain, reported the British Telegraph.
12 Catholic believers and the same atheists were given electrodes in the framework of a fairly bizarre study, while all of us studied a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of the pain.
Thanks to the human brain-depleting technique, Catholics were also able to activate the part of their brain that was responsible for the control of pain.
The study is the first in a series of research that includes scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
The test was carried out quite precisely by strengthening a rocking device to the left of the experimental subject, which delivered the electroscott.
Researchers asked the pilots to look closely at two paintings by Sassoferrato, Mary of the Virgin in the 17th century, and Leonardo da Vinci, the picture of Lady Hermelin in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would cause a religious state among believers, while the image of da Vinci was chosen because it was not too different from the other and soothing.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour on an MRI scanner machine, during this time they received 20 electrocutions in four consecutive parts, while looking at either religious or general images.
The Catholics reported that during the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt "security", like they were "industing" and "satisfied, peace filled them".
While watching a religious picture, 12 percent less pain was reported than when Leonardo was seen in front of himself.
Miguel Farias, a psychologist who himself participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any strong image, including at the atheists, only the right photo should be found.
"We should find a picture that you feel very positive about, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, Anglican Bishop, welcomed the results of the research.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases change our personality."
After the great results, the only question is if Leonardo or a similar caliber painter were to show the image of a madonna for believers, what would be the effect of their pain control?
Would Mary’s vision of the quality virgin mean even better results?
You're the one you share.
On his tenth birthday, you can tell Google: you can find at least as much as you can find in the pockets of people as you're in the sky; you know where you're on vacation, what special orders you're looking for and what they're interested in.
And that's still not enough for Eric Schmidt, one of the company's main people.
However, as far as sceptics are concerned, orwell-likely, are concerned, they do not see the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently said to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect more personal data on their users, and that is necessary to keep themselves in line with the original goal of Google founders, which said, "Let's get all the information in the world".
According to the voiced Google leader, after ten years of world-wide work, the company will be able to handle all the information even at the beginning.
On the question of what will happen in five years' time, Schmidt replied: he wanted Google to answer questions such as "What do I do tomorrow?" or "What work really do I do to me?" - but until then, the software can't answer such simple questions because they can't meet users.
Not all internet users are aware of exactly what IP address they were looking for and which page interested parties have left during online searches.
Through the personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own surf history, look back on what they were looking for, and thus create much more personalized results for them in the long term - the same logic will be based on Recommendations, which will provide us with products and services based on our previous preferences and fixed preferences.
What if my data is used against me if you see what I'm dealing with? - users who are concerned about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not guilt, fear of punishment, freedom, or rebellion against power in the Internet.
However, it is confirmed that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but can, if justified, be transferred to a third party, there is nothing to protect the personal rights of Internet users in such legal cases.
The loudest example of this has been the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information about the pedophiles on the social site it has reserved for Orkut.
In May, however, internet operators concerned with personality rights could have called when the company successfully proved to be true in court with the EFF electronic law enforcement organisation against the FBI: it is not possible to force Google to provide any information that the FBI secretly requested.
(The Federal Government has successfully fought for some 500,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms, which have been obtained by reference to the confirmation of the child protection law adopted over the years, but it has still not been able to obtain the search lists of individual users and the full website and keyword list covering two months.)
Thus, Google's judgment is rather controversial: it is abhorred by those who hold their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and their personal life are falling short of using Google's services and are being put up with a rebellion against them by the multi-stakeholder who appears to be conservative.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the lively computer fans, activists, user-combining hunts see the next generation of corporations, "the cool corporation" in them, unlike rivals, Microsoft, registered for Windows as world conquerors, as much as they can fight for the same purpose.
This may happen because Google does not request user identification code in a way other than Microsoft, does not ask for money for its applications, open free, constantly updated source code and program package to be much more accessible, younger, and more cool than official software history.
However, it may be because the genes understand exactly the very problematic relationship between personality rights and the Internet, which has been the key word of recent years, the web has drawn to 2.0.
This web 2.0 is all about collaborating, deliberately leaving traces behind us and using the communication channels available to us, while their size changes individually, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
In addition, a typical youth from Facebook to Xang, you can connect them with other services such as Twitter or a child who lists your musical habits.fm, and then all of them can be connected to follow-up systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, they can also lead a blog that automatically displays their latest photographers on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can read about a number of exemplary cases: the girlfriend easily realizes the morning photo gallery of the common circle, who has spent the evening with a cheating friend, or can fire the company's employees only because she describes her sincere opinion on senior management in her blog: a sure, the concept of personal life has been completely overrated by now.
Those who live an online life are what they show of themselves, so we can formulate a foundation behind the conduct of young people today.
Anyone who wants to hide something, or at least want to avoid Google Monopoly, can do it (for example, using Google's search system but not leaving a trace with Scroogle).
For example, the number of people who are not registered on the social sites with the intended intent to avoid them may be replaced by alternative versions of Google’s online applications from the editor to the image editor and newsreader, which do not bind to huge server parks and which do not set up the best profile that we have so far.
The public won't wait so secret when Google shows the whites of her teeth.
The company is worth $156 billion more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($120 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and services introduced at an accelerated pace are a major headache not only to Microsoft, but also to a number of other software developers.
The critical observers, however, also find the opposite points that concern them: for example, senior management completely rejected the opposition to employees when it doubled the fee for corporate care, found it too costly for corporate management to eat employees at random on a daily basis, but the fact that Google even ran its head before the Chinese government in 2006 and that, under their agreement, the company was going through all the hits that undermined the good taste and the interests of Chinese regime.
One of the internal rules of the company sounds like a new service is not announced in advance, only when it is already in use, but it is certain that the problems of the coming months and years can move the world again: while some people believe that the Google's project of book- and magazine-scraping and magazine-scraping has killed sizes that the company will soon have to face the US Supreme Court, others are afraid of the health system, because we can build a full health profile from our previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database also gives the next generation of sci-fi writers good raw materials is the novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, the Scroogled point orwell, describes the future in which a person is alarmingly approachable from Google's data.
Two youngsters helped the ostrich killer in the printing process.
Two youngsters of the police listened to the case of the ostrich double murder, suspectedly assisting in the remorse of the crime - said the spokesperson of the Borsod County Police Headquarters on Tuesday.
Young people have recognised the actions that have been imposed on them, and they are currently being accused of crime.
According to the information provided by the two youngsters, two girls are being protected at large.
It is punishable by imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of a double murder in the ozodi, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested in advance on Sunday.
He's suspected of a pre-planned, profit-making crime of multiple man-made homicides.
The investigation revealed that 23-year-olds had a larger amount of money for a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to settle his debt, so he put his creditor in an ozdi location last Wednesday, where he killed him and then his nine-year-old daughter.
According to information from MTI, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, and this is also a sign that he committed the murder with a gun hidden at the scene.
The police will investigate the circumstances of the weapon and its use with expertise.
Stock exchange in Warsaw offered to buy the stock exchange in Prague
Two hundred million euros - some five billion Czech kroons - the stock exchange in Warsaw was recommended for the purchase of the hundreds of hundreds of shares of the stock exchange in Prague.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the stock exchange in Warsaw, confirmed the offer that the Polish stock exchange in Warsaw had previously been excluded from the new owners of the Prague stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the stock market is in state hands.
99 % of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which will sell more than 60 % of the papers during the course of a few months.
The Czech economic daily newspaper E15 is new to know that the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that interested parties so far offered for the sale of Prague.
According to the Czech pages, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Exchange have offered an offer.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague stock exchange last week, said that among interested parties, the stock exchange would be the worst new owner, and it did not rule out that this would lead to the abolition of the price stock in Prague in the future.
The value of the price exchange in Prague is estimated at 5-10 billion dollars by market experts.
According to the shareholders' agreement, about 90 percent of the paper could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with approximately 25 percent stake, followed by Ceska Sporitelna Bank 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13,5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of the European pages
European newspapers in their Tuesday's comments dedicated to the growing international financial crisis have already referred to 'second September 11'.
The global financial disaster is due to the American President - accused of the Roman La Repubblica - the president was not even able to get his own party to line up behind a bill in the wound, which aims to remedy the situation of doubt...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, which was mentioned by Warren Buffett's billion-dollar investor, it is more appropriate to speak on 11 September.
Some of the Madrid press sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has brought the world economy to the edge of collapse.
The threat of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing, and then the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the Congressional vote, the threat is that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just when one of the biggest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored - shows the Geneva Tags-Anzeiger.
Some states are still able to provide rescues to support financial institutions, and with taxpayers' money, they can save them from the bankruptcy.
But if more banks collapse like dominocks, then neither the funds nor the new stamps will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to take over their national self-esteem and to centralise the control over the fragmented financial markets.
Only on Monday, more than €100 billion was received by weak financial institutions - recalling the Vienna Der Standard, that the concerns of European taxpayers, like Americans, have to go deep into their pockets to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not dealt seriously with the crisis, which is sweeping throughout the old continent as a tsunami.
"Peacers" do not have to spend hundreds of billions of euros almost, but it would be good if they were recorded: in which case it is reasonable to extend to taxpayers' money to prevent the damage.
Ideas the donor's flight to the intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid impact if it is not to imitate obstacles in the world of nature?
Like bees.
In the surprise project on CEATEC in Japan, Dongó bees gave strategic initial thought to Nissan engineers to build the next generation of conflict prevention systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a BR23C bio-returned autobot control system, a robotic mini-automation with bee characteristics, with the ultimate aim of helping to develop a system that eliminates all collisions.
During the flight, each bee will create its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety shield - explained at the exhibition by Kazuhhiro Doi, a technological PR and research development director.
Its role is important for the complex eyes of the bee, which can be seen in every direction in more than 300 degrees of vision.
To copy this complex eye function, engineers have reached the idea of a laser telemeter.
This field of vision at 180 degrees outside BR23C identifies obstacles within 2 metres, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which immediately turns into an operation to prevent impact.
During the fraction of the second, the obstacle occurs, and then the auto robot changes direction immediately by turning the wheels around to avoid impact.
In any way contrary to the current system, this avoidable maneuver is carried out in a completely stimulating way.
"If this were not the case, the car robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles" – explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Head of Mobility Laboratory and Auto-robot project.
It must respond in an essential and immediate manner, as this technology corresponds most to the vulnerable and internal layer of the safety shields, a layer within which the impact is currently deemed inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does in order to avoid other bees.
This process has to be done in a moment of sight.
However, unlike bees, the difference must not be directed upwards, downwards or transversals, only two-dimensionals, and only towards the rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the endless possibility for bees to avoid other bees, only movement and acceleration have been used here and slowing has been used as an opportunity for car robots.
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries, which are easier and higher than their energy density, which means that their life expectancy is longer than the lithium-ion version.
Andoh believes that an intelligent reaction is important, not the processing of data, less ability to store it.
This structure has to process and respond to only a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and to respond to the Intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvres data, so only a few dozen kilometres of memory are constantly used.
There's no need for gigabyte, or even for high-sized memory.
This is the first step towards developing immediate exit technology, which, according to Nissan's estimates, could involve serial cars within 10 years.
Further use may be made of the installation of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to drive the car to the destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
He's got a name for the poison kid.
The written version of the $700 billion rescue package law for the purchase of bad bank loans was completed in several details.
In the first round, half the money is spent.
According to the Eastern Coast Time, during the new negotiations after the end of the Saturday midnight, Congress leaders arrived at the convention in the debate about a total of $700 billion rescue package, which has been over the past few days, Reuters reported.
We have made a serious progress - said Nancy Pelosi, President of the American Parliament, who said that there is only a record of the agreement.
He supported the compromise on the package both candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said about the outcome of the compromise: the programme will work and will be effective, but more will be needed. Pelosi says it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy's wagon.
The written version of the package was made public before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday night 8 (i.e. two o’clock in Central Europe) but did not cause a spectacular run on the brochure.
On the draft legislation under the 2008 Economic Emergency Act, on the programme, the House will vote first Monday on the law, and then on the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, then the White House welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and we appreciate the efforts made by the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the spokesperson of the White House.
By the way, the program is different from the original proposal of Bush administration, which would have said that $700 billion would have been spent in the same way for the purchase of low-quality debt securities.
For the first time, the amount of 700 billion can be spent up to half of the amount of 250 billion, which is expected to be used immediately after Congress vote on Monday, of which the Ministry of Finance will buy back-rated securities, and the fate of another 100 billion dollars will depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be monitored by a separate body, including the President of the Federal Reserve.
The commitment of the other half of the 700 billion will depend on the new decision of Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can use a combined tactics: you can buy at the same time bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and other types of "toxic" loans.
The authorities of the Ministry have been informed about the purchase in the framework of auctions and directly.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme where the financial wallet guarantees the instrument of concern for which companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected losses.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary tools to obtain up to $700 billion for urgent needs of the US financial system, whether it is about buying bad tools in a wide range of ways, whether insurance or avoiding systemic risks involving the collapse of a large financial institution.
We take the necessary steps to prepare for the introduction of the law, as soon as it is signed, to add it to it.
However, the heads of the banks who are in trouble and are waiting for state aid can expect their withdrawal money, which the overseas slang simply calls a gold paratrooper, limited by the government.
Payments are limited only in some cases, and the limitations depend on the way the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry buys an auction, it will make extra money on the gold paratrooper unless he is retired for the deputized bank leader.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the management money is not exceeded.
The image includes not changing existing gold parasols contracts, the restriction only applies to new ones to encourage the participation in the programme as such.
This is the first case in American history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs - he commented on the measure by President of the House's Financial Services Committee, the Democratic Party Barney Frank.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the State acquires the right to acquire shares, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can eventually win the transaction as the economy and the saved bank recover.
The draft law provides that in the next five years, the President will have to submit a proposal to Congress on how to bring taxpayers back the expected losses from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were people who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens asked for, that is, not protecting taxpayers' dollars - a Republican representative of Darrell Issa in California.
Mr Kaptur, a colleague of the Democratic Republic of Ohio, believed that the measures were the same as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to increase
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, by 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007.
The prices of industrial export sales were 1.1 per cent higher compared to July 2008, which decreased by 3.9 per cent one year earlier.
As a result of domestic and export price changes, industrial producer prices were 0.7 per cent higher than in the previous month, compared to 3.2 per cent higher than one year earlier.
Domestic sales prices of the industry increased only to a minimum by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices of processing industries also increased to a small extent by 0.1 per cent compared to July.
The largest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather product industry (2.8%) mainly due to an increase of 4.6% in the production of leather and footwear and an increase of 2.5% in monthly prices in footwear production.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of chemical and product production (1.6 per cent).
There has been a drop in prices in the oil processing sectors (1.4%), the production of electrical machinery, the production of instruments (0.5%) and, to a minimum, wood processing (0.1%).
The prices of paper production, publishing, printing activities have not changed.
In the other processing industries, we measured price increases between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors representing a significant weight in domestic sales of the industry, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the transitional effect of the official gas price increase implemented from 1 July.
In twelve monthly comparisons, in terms of domestic sales of the processing industries, prices increased most in the petroleum processing sector (32.4%).
Manufacture of metal processing products in the sector was 13,2 %, with an increase of 11 % in prices in the production of food, drink and tobacco representing a fixed weight.
Price reductions occurred in the sectors of textiles, textile products (2.5 per cent) and the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.3 per cent).
In the other processing sectors, the rate of price increase was between 0.6 per cent and 9.1 per cent.
Throughout the processing industry, prices have increased by 10.2 per cent over the last year.
The prices of the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7% higher than one year earlier.
In domestic sales, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was seen in August of the target groups of the sectors.
In the sectors producing consumer goods increased by 0.3 per cent, prices did not vary in the energy and downstream sectors compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, the highest increase in prices was observed in energy and consumption sectors (16.8 per cent) compared to the same month of the previous year.
In the industry producing consumer goods, we measured an increase of 6.8 per cent, a decrease of 1.4 per cent in investment goods.
The export sales prices in the industry forints increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month and decreased by 3.9 per cent in comparison with 12 months.
Our domestic currency increased by 1.7 per cent in a month compared to the euro, by 7.1 per cent compared to the dollar, compared with August 2007, by 7.5 per cent to the euro, compared to the dollar by 15.9 per cent.
Next year, don't you need a visa to the United States?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance of entering into the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement around 12 January - the Secretary of State spoke of this in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarians.
According to his opinion, "it depends on whether or not the electronic entry or control system is built on the overseas side".
At the same time, he pointed out that there would be no admission permit in the new system, but the tourists would have to register before departure.
From now on, the Hungarian head of diplomacy will negotiate in Washington.
He meets with Minister of Foreign Affairs of Condoleezza Rice, who is handed over by the President of the Republic of Hungary to the Central Cross of the Stargal Prize and talks with candidate foreign policy advisors of Barack Obama and John McCain.
Next to the rescue package is Barack Obama and McCain.
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the president of both the two major US parties, provided the government's $700 billion rescue package, but there is a politician who demands the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
On Sunday morning, after the negotiations between Congress and Administration, they announced on Sundays after the dates of the congress and the Ministerial Administration: they concluded an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The financial package aimed at the crisis in Wall Street and the melting of frozen credit markets has become the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain also appear to be more suitable than their competitors to take the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, Obama once again gained some advantage with the promotion of economic issues, the advantage of McCain, which he obtained after the Republican Convention, with Vice-President Sarah Palin.
On Sunday, Obama expressed his hope at a detroiti campaign meeting that the 700 billion package law would be adopted quickly by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained the consumer protection passports that he supported.
"Now we have to act with responsibility (...) for your position, for your savings, for the entire industry, for the stability of the entire economy," he said before the 35 thousand.
He didn't forget to call it McCain's economic ideas over time.
In his interview with ABC, McCain explained, "this is something we're all going to be having to swallow (...) but nothing can simply walk".
Senator Republic stated that the proposal included the setting up of the Finance Minister’s Supervisory Committee and the restriction of the end-of-head discharge, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no real role in the negotiations, but he had a daily relationship with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi announced on Sunday that the House of Parliament was hopefully voting on the bill on Monday.
German language page
The camp on the right has become more self-conscious only within the camp, thus analysing the weak role of Der Spiegel in the CSU in Bavaria.
Haders are ready to govern Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of German newsmagazine on the left, Franz Walter, the Bajoran revolution analyses the reasons for CSU’s dramatic defeat.
According to a well-known politician, the Erosion of CSU has begun well before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over his office.
For decades, the Christian socialists have renewed Bajoran - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change in the era is a whole Christian democracy, and so is Angela Merkel's problem.
The failure was not quite surprising for CSU, but a process ended on Sunday, which was likely to be almost exactly 10 years ago: an undisputed hegemia of a state party has ceased.
Ten years ago, he landed at 47.7% CSU in 1998, for the first time in the 50s under the 50 percent level.
This has been repeated for three years in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so even in the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consistent modernisation of CSU in the province, which eats its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were wrong at the pace. However, there could be no consequences for the CSU's loyalty to the electors' CSU's, the educational results, the establishment of the East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bajoria.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this are also visible.
The camp on the right was intact, only within the camp became more self-conscious, more critical, more self-conscious.
It is also noticeable that in the last few weeks, the classics were mostly away from CSU; free professionals, industrialists, graduates and graduates.
The CSU's support has already been under 40 percent.
Die Presse (dipresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper "Who, with whom? The parties are dealing with the dissatisfactional political situation that has emerged since the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ intervention into internal affairs.
The BZÖ appears to be open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not yet want to discuss the coalition.
The election has taken place, all around the coalition; the parties have barely allowed access to their cards in the debate on public service television.
Werner Faymann SPÖ confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to show that it is possible to cooperate with the two parties - in certain provinces and in the social partnership.
The question is whether a coalition with Wilhelm Moltererrell - the current President of the ÖVP, as a coupper, could imagine - Faymann left it open.
As you said, Schüssel-Molterer's course was opened anyway.
The repetition of this direction does not come into question.
Molterer reacted carefully to red offers.
As you said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann attempts to intervene in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
To choose the opposition or enter the coalition, the party is now completely open in the party, the questions must be discussed in the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider BZÖ once again appeared open in every direction.
"In order to prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility" - said Haider.
Járóka: It is necessary to break the evil circle of poverty, segmentation
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun. This year, France is the host of the Presidency of the European Union.
Ms Járóka Lívia, the fidesman of the European People's Party, called attention to education segmentation in her message to professional advice as one of the main speakers, because this is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children and their enforcement.
The high level conference, on behalf of the French Presidency, was opened by Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Vladimir Spidla.
Representatives of governments, the European social partners and the most important European legal and civil society organisations have been invited to the discussion.
According to the Press Office of the Fidesz EP Group, Járóka warned that, in addition to discrimination at work, the Roma need, in particular, to be excluded from the labour market due to low levels of education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have secondary education and, as a result of low-quality primary education, only have an insignificant share of higher education".
It also stressed that, as fundamental human rights, education plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children may mean strengthening the economy of EU Member States.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to make this link known between the Roma and the Roma in the widest sense.
As early as Roma students start school, the chances of becoming productive members of the labour market are increasing; they contribute to the national budget through taxes paid for income and consumption.
"Romans should have the right to have their right to quality education on the part of their EU citizens, and should guarantee the elimination of their low-quality and isolated education" - stressed Járóka Livvia.
According to the Commissioner, the European Union's objective and action-oriented combination is necessary to speed up school desegregation processes immediately, and to do so is essential to ensure proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination measures.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segmentation, unemployment, Roma children have given democratic space, so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as a full-righted citizen" - Járóka.
In the record of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All since the last Berlin meeting, the objective of the European Week for Equal Opportunities is to provide a unique forum for promoting equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, they will decide on the fate of the fallen Huber-Beckstein duo
Despite the gross fall in election, the heads have not fallen yet, and the summits of the Bajoran CSU have been able to discuss personal questions for the time being.
Mr Erwin Huber and Prime Minister of Günther Beckstein will still remain in position, asking how long the grace will last.
On the fate of the 17 percent catastrophal flow loss tandem, the final weekend of October will be an extraordinary party resistance.
In any case, many of the couple who are well-deprived have noticed that they do not stick to their chairs with all their powers.
In this way, they tried to relieve the angry members of the political group and the base who, one day after the "bajor tsunami", called for personal concessions due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - true, even with Edmund Stoiber's lead on his career - the Christian social union gained 60.7 percent, but now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, he ran only 43.4 percent of their power.
CSU has been "one-off" for 46 years, accounting for 18 percent of German GDP in Bajoria.
Conservatives continue to count highly on the Hungarian economy in a key southern province, and they will certainly be forced in the future.
As one of the first signs of intra-party restructuring, Vice-President Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister of Agriculture will also be present in the narrow detection team that will open negotiations with the liberal FDP and the Free Opponents on the right-hand side.
The fate of the strange fart is that Gabriele Pauli, on the list of Free Opponents, is going to be on the list of Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber, was used as a double buffer for Huber-Beckstein, and then unscrupulously hurt the big-ass municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now turning all their energy into some sort of stabilisation of Beckstein.
The transition will take an active role so far, as will the Stoiber from the background, the former Prime Minister and former CSU president, who also called him the darkest day of September 28th.
Huber was stunned by some notes about CDU on Monday, saying that they would have earned a lot more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the election of the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel cannot be a Chancellor if the CSU, which has a significant national success in 2005, is somehow not put on hold by common forces.
According to Merkel, the loss of soil of CSU will not have a negative effect on the big coalition in Berlin.
What is, of course, relative is that it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will last longer.
The SPD has achieved its weakest result since 1946.
Lukanoise: 110-0
None of the opposition representatives entered the Belarus Parliament following the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the welfare and stability of the country led by Aleksandr Lukasenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation at European Security and Cooperation (ESF), by the illegality of the vote counting.
The EBESZ sending 150 observers from 43 countries did not recognise the elections.
Although the law of the 10 million country does not require opposition for a further decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition, the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) was seriously hoping that, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution, the presidential mandate of the election of 2006 with the debated cleanliness will be renewed by Lukashenko, this time allowing a few opposition representatives to be present in Parliament.
The OMSZ therefore also withdrew from the pre-considered bug.
In the background of opposition expectations, Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, has been credited to reduce Russia's persistent natural gas imports, and has also contributed to bringing Beltranszgaz gas pipelines across the country - to improve its relationship with the EU, where there is no entry permit for Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians who are considered to be anti-democratic Belarus.
In advance, the EBESZ pointed out that, when assessing the election campaign, it was more of a positive move rather than a lack of a third ban on opposition candidates.
However, on Monday's report, the EBESS has already objected to the campaign - during which opposition candidates were essentially unable to appear in the press - and, in particular, that the opposition could not have been present in the counting of votes.
However, according to the opposition, progress in the political system has been felt: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk has also agreed to a minor conflict with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia - which forms a federal state on the paper of Belarus - considers the two areas to be independent for a month.
- We have taken two steps forward, one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said to our page, Aleksandr Milinkevics.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain, despite the fact that "the power was afraid of allowing even one of its opposition to the weightless Parliament".
The opposition does not plan to send a message to the electorate, rather about the need for economic reforms.
Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print opposition cards in Russia, and there are obstacles to the dissemination by local authorities, but I can see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly, Milinkevics said, indicating that Lukasenko's regime, which considers the main result of creating social security, not even the most officially supported pensioners.
- Because of the country's recapitalisation, the increase in the commercial deficit, the question of the deterioration of social security in the "creating silence" is the question of Milinkevics.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers have recognised the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebegyev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosztyi, that "people believe not words, but actions", so the lack of opposition is proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electorate.
Brunetta: "Reggeli only before working hours"
In the history of Chigi Palace, uniquely operated doorways were installed for the exit and entry of workers.
As of today, this new measure will take effect against the prosecutors, the screening of those who block and then go get a coffee in working hours.
Today, the anti-solid novelty was presented to the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Administration of Renato Brunetta and Mauro Masi, Prime Minister's Office.
"The skipper - said Brunetta - is for better and more efficient work, for the reduction of deficits and for the increase of services"
"A new, more responsible and transparent period will come.
This is the real reform" - emphasised Brunetta.
Chigi Palace will complete all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says that "the installation of the screwcaps is also symbolicly important".
The secretary-general confirmed that the action was approved by the staff, everyone cooperated.
Then the breakfast is over in working hours, no more coffee and brios.
Brunetta, smiling, advises: "A nice little cappuccino in the morning at seven, she's able to do miracles"
At the Roman Public Administration College
The Minister stated that "in three months, there was a 50 percent reduction in public health deficits, which means more work involving 600,000 people over a year".
She added, however, that the Italian administration should be more effective.
, "which, according to the Minister, has been twice the size of the private sector in the last eight to ten years, and has been well above the rate of inflation".
At the same time, thousands of civil servants have gathered together, joining the submission supported by the Organisation of the Italian Environment and Consumer Protection Associations to protest against the provisions of the Brunetta Regulation.
"As the Minister of Administration is proud of the data supporting the reduction of the disease deficits, the war of the "emergencyless suns" continues to grow", says the Consumer Protection Association.
Over Italy thousands of decent and hard-working administrative staff have gathered together to announce war on the illegal requirements of the regulation."
The regional administrative court shall, among other things, attack the abolition of additional benefits for medical reasons, the extension of the stay of sick leave workers at home, which means the period within which the patient visitor may appear and several other aspects of the new provisions laid down by the Minister.
Jobs accidents: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything else.
In Italy there are 2.500 accidents at work every day, 3 of which are killed and 27 of them have a lasting disability.
According to the accident insurance at work, nearly 1.200 deaths were reported in 2007.
The figures testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death, and almost twice as much as human killing.
Today Anmil 58 times in all regions of Italy, the day of the accidents at work that were traditionally held on Sundays of October 2 to draw attention to this dramatic problem of institutions, social organisations and mass communication.
"The worrying data reported by Anmi, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, demonstrate that the prevention of accidents at work has a vital role to play," said Pietro Mercandelli, President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the National Association of the Baleseti Rokkant in Labour.
The Head of State sincerely welcomed the "unity of association's commitment to the prevention of work, the protection of the interests of workers with an accident, the assistance of family members of victims and the adoption of public opinion".
"The tragedy of the media and public opinion, which is of a real nature and shared by everyone, is that we have to face up to this kind of delusion, but in reality we have to face the dramatic, repeated and repeated cases of the day".
Napolitano states openly: "We are experiencing a double resource deficit, funding for education and information is crucial.
Initiatives within the school which aim at the direct education of young people at the entry into the world of work are of particular importance.
We have a duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to the social importance of the issue, and to require more effective legislation to be applied.
Gianfranco Fini, president of the Lower House, stressed from his own side, that "the serious and social importance of accidents at work which are fatal, all of us, and the institutions require this to be brought to an end as soon as possible".
"The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this type is still amazingly high", noted Pietro Mercandelli, President Anmil.
"We do not want, at the same time, to have this decreasing trend, with less attention, because there will be the greatest tragedy in the event of the loss of attention."
"We believe that at the general level we are still not doing everything we can to overcome this phenomenon, which could be solved through a complex action programme.
In our opinion, it was necessary to monitor and monitor more strictly - as well as to increase the level of intervention of Mercandelli in the field of labour training, from school education."
"More efforts are needed to inform and make public".
What is most needed, however, is a more responsible working environment against a phenomenon that poses a social problem."
After that, Mercandelli judged "the gradual deterioration of the protection net for victims of accidents at work" and the "aid orientation towards which the system is falling in the last few years".
"The aim, therefore, is to give back insurance to workers, because the fate of the victims of the accident must not depend on the self-sufficient place of the legislators, where they are diversive".
Hallucination can be caused by MP3 players
To remain hearing damage, listening to portable audio recording devices such as MP3 devices for longer duration and high volume –
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the EU Scientific Committee on New and Newly identified health risks (SCENIHR) informed of its opinion today.
"The opinion reveals that those who have been listening to their portable composers for five years for five years, with a high volume, can be read in the explanation.
"It is worrying that young people who use high-power portable music players and mobile phones are not aware that they can be irreversibly damaged by hearing," said Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific surveys indicate an undisputable risk to which we urgently need to respond", the EU Commissioner added.
The key task is to inform consumers and disseminate information about them in a broad sense.
In the light of this opinion, we also need to review existing control systems so that they can function properly and keep pace with the latest technologies".
Brussels called on the independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem in view of the spread of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people who have been exposed to noise.
"The researchers confirm that we have cause for concern, and the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine the possible measures to be taken to protect children and young people from noise pollution by portable players and similar means", said a member of the Committee.
In 100 dB of the current European Safety Regulation, the maximum level of noise released by portable composers is determined by the current European Safety Regulation, but the increasing concern is accompanied by the information on hearing damage caused by the excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise loss, which can significantly reduce these hearing damage.
In the opinion of the EU Scientific Committee, it is clear from the opinion that those using portable recording devices who listen to music with a high voice (more than 89 Decibli) per week for five hours are above the present maximum value for the noise at work.
If someone listens to music for a longer time under similar circumstances, there will be a risk of permanent hearing damage after five years.
This affects about 5-10 percent of users of portable equipment, which could mean 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanne will set up a committee responsible for the future of the capital
Today begins, until March, the results are expected in June.
This agenda was set for the functioning of the Committee of the Capital Government called "The Future of the capital of Romania", which met this morning at the new headquarters behind the Caracalla Bath.
For the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commission members will draw up Rome's directives.
After the end of March, the general meeting and the municipal committee will assess the study and the plans to be able to present the strategic plan of the capital, which is officially approved by Prime Minister Gianni Alemano in June.
"This is a fully independent committee in which all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas are represented - stressing the task of Alemano - to develop proposals for the development ideas of Rome, which may be relied upon by political decision-makers, so the General Assembly and the Self-government Committee.
There is no conflict of competence, only one platform where great plans for the benefit of Rome can be created.
In March, after his work, the committee will be divided up because it has a permanent mandate.
In June, we will present a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee on the Future of the capital of Romania - the Prime Minister said.
For those who consider the Commission to be unnecessary, referring to the fact that the opinion it has put forward does not have a binding force, Alemano responds: "All depends on what work the Commission will do and what quality proposals it will make to the table.
If the standard proves to be appropriate, as will the Attall Committee in France, which I am sure in the case of Rome, it will be important for its contribution.
Policy forces are often fragmented in day-to-day affairs and in the management of urgent cases of time.
On the other hand, taking into account the long-term aspects, we look further away and plan for a longer period, and we are committed to working for the development and future of Rome".
The Mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is not considered to be useless "waterheads" because it is completely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome any euro, but it will serve as an inspiration and aim to involve the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemano, "there is a need for an open-end and flexible strategic framework that allows our city to jump on the standard that it would need so much, thinking about its future in a united spirit".
The future that the Mayor of Rome stresses: "It will not only be limited to the current local government framework, but also to a much further extent" is not only seen in the future metropolis and the status of the capital, but also "the role that Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean can play as capital, and which he must fill".
Obama, the first president against America, we'll show you why.
A well-known, independent American politician wrote about this: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
It was the first Jimmy Carter to break the American economy with his decisions and to maintain close relations with my enemy Islam (as it is today as a private person).
As the time of the elections approaches, the attacks on Obama are increasing.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambition.
Obama, in a facial way, believes that he can gain the highest public rights of a nation with two governors and five senators of black until now!"
These attacks are actually nothing; of course they are racist, but they do not answer the question of whether the voters will be a good president. Then there are public opinion polls: they indicate that Obama will win, with a significant advantage.
In that case, there is someone who listens to his feelings and does not listen to his mind.
In the interior of the South States, a Mississippi newspaper wrote this in its guide: we know that in the electorate, the true American nation of Hungary will give its vote.
A side of American thinking appears here that remains hidden until the last moment.
"Just talk to me what you want, and we'll know where we're putting the text on Obama or McCain."
Some people swear to him, if Obama wins, they leave the United States.
They never said such words until now when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all these smart things, the Democrats' winning weapon is George Bush himself.
They asked 1500 people about the mistakes they made during Bush's term of office? 89 percent said Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation has lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and it's been thrown in the bottom of it, flying all the way home.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
The majority still believe that Iraq was a weak point.
There's a huge task waiting for someone to take George W.'s place.
U.S.: Economic collapse is felt by journalists, the time of the suspensions in the editors. Many people blame the Internet because of the 'death' of the printed press.
The PEW research institute asked 500 U.S. journalists about how they felt about their future position and spiritual power.
Well, right now, almost every journalist's pessimistic about his future.
However, it was not clearly claimed that their concern for credibility was reduced.
They don't feel as isolated as before.
The problem with U.S. journalists is money.
They believe that the 2008 crisis is a failure in a powerless economic model.
Another serious problem is the restrictions on newssroom, i.e. the journal editor’s editor’s publications.
If we do not want the traditional journalism, in the sense of what the great public understands under it, to shrink to a minimum, this problem must be solved - say the interviewed journalists.
Today, well-seen and complex pessimism is characterized by American journalism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior leaders in the printed press are convinced that national jurisprudence is on the wrong road.
At local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior position.
Printed versus electronic press.
Press workers do not have a problem to see where the world web is going.
The biggest publishers are on their way to the Internet, which many people believe is the "killer of the printed press".
The economic pressure identified by journalists increased to 79 percent.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted that they would put their vox next to the technology in the hope that it might benefit the jurisprudistics.
Today in the U.S. press, there's a gap between the editors, the directors, and the reporters who work for them.
At national level, 56 percent of leaders are sure to share their information with others, while at local level this share can only be 23 percent.
Some of them have linked this to a certain job.
At national level, 47 percent of managers are concerned that they can lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this percentage is 30 per cent.
In America, the issue of "sure work" is constantly on the agenda for our editors.
Only 13 percent of journalists have a contract.
In the case of a huge nation like the 300 million inhabitants of the United States, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet service operate, employers generally recommend as much as they want, so the thing works on "kell or not".
Directors usually receive high pay and editors can earn tens of thousands of dollars per month in addition to the pension and health insurance fee.
Freedom, however, is a rather complicated principle: the first year is x day, also in the third, until after a certain period it reaches the maximum of 15 days.
But U.S. journalists, according to their own statement, over the year, often "be sick".
It's all climate function.
UNIPOL: REPUBLIC OF DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATABAN MARAD
Mr Rinaudo, president of the second member of the Roman Court of Justice, rejected Danilo Coppola's application for the property industry, who wanted to pass from his residence in Grottaferrata to a Roman apartment.
There is an economic bankruptcy against Coppola in the context of an investigation in the context of an agreement on the exchange of shares in Unipol - BNL.
Last week, during the procedure initiated against him, house arrest was lifted and turned to a residence ban for Grottaferrat.
Lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, applied for the property to be transferred from small town to capital apartment.
However, according to the Court of Justice, these cases of gas (the prosecutor has proposed a rejection) would enable the company to influence the company’s affairs and to have access to evidence against them.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House did not vote on the $700 billion rescue package submitted by the White House: a significant part of the Americans were more interested and still interested in the punishment of Wall Street than the rescue of the economy.
This is supported by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis has resulted in a break in the Republican Party, which shows an ever greater division between the traditional Eastern Coasts in favour of federal institutions and business circles and the growing anti-Denmarks in Central and Southern states.
This orientation was established in a critical way in the House's vote referred to in the introduction.
However, this event is just one of the significant changes that the economic restructuring that is still taking place will indicate or allow us to see, not only in the United States, but also in the whole Western world, and perhaps beyond it.
It seems that the crisis, in the US and in Europe, is only speeding up those events that have long since grown up in this new atmosphere and will finally be sunk.
The first such phenomenon is the re-inclusion, the return of a double category of state sovereignty to public knowledge, the re-nationalisation of the economy.
The crisis also affects banking institutions, which also have close links with foreign countries, but primarily, and quite widely, people and families who live in a single country.
This, however, is a direct political challenge for those in the government: what to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who choose otherwise.
Therefore, the crisis seems to be global in economic terms, but in political terms it is almost exclusively national.
It seems that political internationalism is essentially out of line: this is a good evidence of the European Union, which is not able to set a single policy line between different interests and different national strategies.
So everyone from each national government expects intervention, rescue package, recovery and new rules, but above all the opening of funds, because only individual states have economic resources, a financial stock capable of putting things right.
They also have their instruments and their powers to use them: they have, under certain circumstances, two invaluable sources that are likely to have no other market and no international organisation will ever have such an extent.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed on the national state of the crisis is fully in line with the fact that economic growth in recent times is an increasingly important factor which is closely linked to this element: this is territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the world of the network, the increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was ordered to rule the world, once we had to realize that our future is more and more dependent on things that are not taken apart than water, crops and oil.
From things that can be moved from one side of the planet to another, yet completely surrounded, they can be linked to one area.
So whoever controls the area has a much more batter card than who was born in a place where there is no crop, no oil and no water.
This would also move me to the second novelty, a line of breaking.
Anyone who says that the area, state, government, must say: politics, other words, leadership.
From this point of view, it appears that the economic crisis is producing two conflicting phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for credible leadership is for those who can take action.
On the other hand, the current management brings, in particular, the total loss of credit from economic leaders, who have proved to be completely inappropriate and have demonstrated that many of them still have a vague area.
The two together have even deeper meaning and, in some respects, more disturbing: the sense of credit loss, patience, inability and isolation, which is increasingly affecting the entire management elite in several Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that there is an increasing number of people who believe that the time of the social elite that is now at the top has expired. It has expired before they did their experience, their way of life, their culture, within the meaning of the word complex, and this would make the social elite increasingly different from the opinion of the majority.
In addition, the need for leadership, in a covert form, promotes a broad but strong delegation movement against the dominant division and the traditional political system. This is not expected by the voters in their 'conceptions', or in recent times the sudden changes in the public voice. For example, the arrival of the conservatives in Austria and Bajoria, the collapse of the Labour Party unit in Great Britain or the rebellion against the American Congressmen Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right side can be described here).
It seems that the traditional elite, its parties, its programs, and even that we can say that, with his habits, his press and his famous intelligence, he is becoming less and less able to represent what is going on in the deeper parts of Western society. Furthermore, the economic crisis is growing, spreading and potentially incapable of creating more and more invaluable ideas.
Despite all this, talking about a "denial rebellion of the masses" would be, to be honest, overdoing.
But walking with an open eye doesn't hurt at all.
We can walk on the wall with a super-power.
With a super-powerful glue to defeat gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This goal was set up by several American research centres, and a group of four institutions is nearing the solution.
With only a 2.5 square centimeters of glue, researchers managed to tape a 100-pound body to a vertical wall and hold it there.
The American journal The Science published the findings of some of the researchers at the University of Dailyton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material developed by the scientific group has been developed by the further development of existing, so called carbon nanotubes.
"The operating principle of glue must be imagined as a package of pipe systems similar to spaghetti", says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher of the Atlantic Georgia Institute of Technology.
Researchers have drawn the idea of the foot covered with a gecko microscopic canopy that gives the animal a perfect touch.
The tests with various materials, such as glass, teflon and glazed paper, have confirmed that the new glue is 10 times more effective than the feet of the said seals, but it is easily removed from the wall, explains Liming Dai, the engineering arm of the University of Dailyton.
- "This material can be useful as a temporary glue" - adds Liming Dai.
Can we walk on the wall just like Spider-Man? Maybe, but researchers think more of a less impressive use than linking electronic devices, because coal nanopipes well conduct heat and electrical power.
You can also find more applications in space research.
The superheroes can still wait.
A new glue is being experimented with the University of Berkeley, California.
According to the article published in American Chemical Society c., Californian scientists have presented a hair-based adhesive that is made of micro-rich material that undergoes self-cleaning during the movement of the surface and thus always provides a perfect touch.
It's not allowed with fruit.
We need to take care of the graffiti, oranges and almals.
These high vitamins, especially in summer, are popular thirsty drinks, if combined with certain life-saving medicines, alter their absorption, if increased, or reduced, depending on the case, and may have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario of London, called attention to the risks of co-administration of boxed or fresh fruit juices and certain medicines. The professor announced at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, thereby preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the health of the patient.
Grapephruitl has already been placed on the door of the defendants, when it turns out that it is able to increase the effect of some antibiotics, antihistamine, anxiety, heart rhythm control and nerve control to the level of toxicity.
KOCKAZÁZAZATOS - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Medicine has released the news in its official journal and warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with such co-use and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NO CSAK GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, oranges and apples contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
The list of active substances that inhibit the absorption of grapephritis and other fruit juices could be listed in Hosz.
He points out that Michele Carruba, professor of the Medical Department of the State University of Milan, says: "This kind of discovery is usually immediately indicated to the various national and international pharmaceutical agencies, who, if necessary, ensure that the information contained in the prospectus on that medicinal product is changed.
That is why we must always read the information on the medicinal product intended to be taken, and if anything is not understood, let us not influence ourselves, but let us ask our doctor or pharmacist clearly" - stressed the specialist of the Ansa Institute.
Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for Economics
The American Paul Krugman received an economic Nobel Prize, an analysis of the regional contexts of commercial models and economic activity.
55-year-old Neokeyenian Krugman, at Princeton University, is a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the smallest critics of Bush's economic and foreign policy measures.
A few months after the terrorist attack in September 2001, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman announced in the New York Times that the last event would have more fatal consequences than the collapse of the twin towers.
This forecast was not a little bit of a debate, it was put in the eyes of the economist more than once, but we now know that it was accurate.
"I'm surprised, and I'm a little shocked at how quickly the public interest went over the fall of Enron or Worldcom", said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "roppant valuable economist", while he is rather "dissembling his criticisms of the excessive liberalism of the Bush Government".
Open Office, the third edition is worth the "Microsoft Anti-Microsoft" package
A free-code open-source application package with OpenOffice.org 3.0 will appear today, which will target wider layers of Microsoft Office as a free alternative, from home to office users, from free-employed people to administrative authorities.
After almost a year's work by SUN Microsystem supervised and voluntary developers, the new Open Office is taking place with more novelty for the general public: outside the welcome screen and the re-thinked, less specific user interface, it offers more important innovations. For example, the compatibility with Apple Mac OS X's operational system and supports the new ISO standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
Particular attention has been paid to the compatibility with the Office 2007 system, so Open Office can open new extension Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
An interesting feature of some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint shows. This can be useful for sending files via email. Another function supports the import of PDF files into a graphic module, while keeping a lateral layout.
On this same surface, we can also create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format with table editors or editors.
The distribution of applications has also been through a number of improvements: the table manager supports the joint use of workbooks, but prevents each other from overwrite their work. Each employee's comments are marked with a different colour, which helps to make it easier to recognise at the inspection stage.
Some companies are already working on the fact that some of OpenOffice's functions are available on the Internet (on the Cloud, on the cloud), so the final version is likely to be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, after it has been found on myrror sites since Friday, can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0%/download300.html
The program package is also available for Linux outside the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
On request, we can take over the installation CD either at home or at work.
Freedom is likely to be the most attractive for the spread of home application, but the Open Office Programme package is now trying to hit the business sector as it can count on a number of administrative and school projects.
There are no educational, advisory and service services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open new business distances.
The Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, a word editor; Calc, a table manager to replace Excel; Impress, Powerpoint presentations; Dbase is the most well-known, Access database manager; and finally Draw the graphical module.
The 2008 target is 5 million downloads. However, if we consider that the new version is already at 3.600,000, this figure is likely to be higher than expected.
Kohl's positive, it's already the fourth doping case.
At the last stage of the Tour de France, a positive sample was produced again by Austrians Bernhard Kohl, competing in the colors of the Gerolsteiner team, who also won the best mountain resort trico next to my Bronzem.
The news is on the website of the Equipe Internet newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl, after the fourth contestant, the Italian Riccardo Ricci, Leonardo Piepol, as well as the German, Gerolsteiner contestant Stefan Schumacher, who produced a positive result on the Cera test in the third generation of EPO.
As for Kohl's blood sample, similar to the tests conducted in the last few weeks, the laboratories in Slauanne and Chatenay-malabry have been tested.
If the control tests confirm positive Cera results, Austria shall lose its third position and, as the case may be, prohibit competition for two years.
The news on the positive outcome of the Kohl's third generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, the head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and the Associated Press news agency: he reported a positive doping result to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrians, behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, managed to be a drummer, and they won the best mountaintop trick.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE NEW YORK IS DOING, WORRY?
The country of migrants in Italy has only recently changed from one of the popular targets of immigrants who have been admitted to attraction.
That's why it's going to be the racist nation of Belpaese? This question is being addressed by the New York Times, which is based on the case of Abdul William Guibre of Burkina Faso, who was murdered last month in Milan because he stole a box of biscuits - a long article devoted to the debate about racism in Italy.
The case is a good sign of what the New York Times calls the "good paradox": in the northern regions, "the strongest is integration and the highest is employment", while "the promotion of immigration and the North League" are also the strongest in the country.
To support the increasing tension between the Italians and immigrants, the NYT also refers to cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws required by the League, which would bring the gypsies closer to immigration and facilitate the removal of illegal immigrants, have been set as an example of mood change in Italy.
This trend is also highlighted by the President of the Pope and the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano XVI. He met Benede in the Quirinale Palace and he said that the state and the Church should cooperate to overcome racism".
Students suffer from expensive rents, up to 900 euros in a room
The market for accommodation for university students is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, A student in Naples can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now been full of amazing sizes, which, due to the large total costs of families, closes the wide layers of students' learning from the possibility of learning", explains Laura Marianni, Head of the Finnish Study Office. "In these cities, the high demand for students has distorted the market to such an extent that the general defamation process has started against local residents."
In the majority of cases, real estate offers include a number of irregularities: non-registration contracts with no rental restrictions, combined with leases.
According to Sunia, exceptional measures would be needed to maximise prices by reviewing the tax system.
The details of the survey show that in Milan, around Brianza, there is also 450 euros for a bed; the price of a single room is from 650 euros (in the vicinity of Bande Nere) to 800 euros on average (Lamaniate, Udine and Fiera), but can reach 900 euros (in the vicinity of Vittoria).
In Florence, a beds cost an average of 350/400 euros, a room is about 700.
In Bologna, where students live in close proximity to the university, a bed costs 250/280 euros if it is double and 370-500 euros when it comes to a single room.
In Rome, around €600 is requested in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) for a single and 450 bed in a double room.
Something cheaper (550 euros for a single room) at prices in other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
In the suburbs, you can save all of them: €300 will cost a bed and 450 a single room in Prenastina, Centocelle and other similar areas.
In Naples, you will request 300/450 euros for a bed, from 400 to 600 euros for a room. The price difference is the highest in the area of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, you have to pay 250/350 euros for a single bed and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they represent a higher weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, there is another disorder: the rent charged by foreign students is about 25-30 per cent higher than for Italian tenants.
Good-bye, old Cinema Paradiso, in the cities the time of the old cinemas
Traditional cinemas shut down for multiplexes.
"A city where there are no movies, a blind city, like a blind face."
The images made by the director of Giuseppe Toweratore show everything that is carried out in the Italian capitals, but also in the rural regions.
The slowdown of the cinema - the appearance of large multi-thermal cinemas in the suburbs, and the subsequent one-offing of the one-offers in the city centers - an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time it carries all the features of a true cultural crime.
When places full of historical and memory appear, "it's like a friend going away, a friend with whom we shared our journey and many experiences," says director of Cinema Paradiso. The film that reported Oscar's prize 20 years ago, and the grand prize of the Cannes Festival, tells the story of a small-town cinema in Ireland, the craving for salt, a movie that may have been lost forever.
The largest association of operators, the data reported by Anec, is clearly speaking: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas were closed. The biggest losses were recorded by cinemas in large cities: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 Turin and 5 Palermo.
Among the regions most affected are Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 single-term cinema, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And for their disappearance, the responsibility for the loss of multiplex is no better than Italy's number of newly opened multi-term cinemas in these three regions: in the last five years, the number of rooms rose by 195 in Lombardia, 81 in Tuscany and so on in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally" says the President of Anec Paolo Protti. "It is right that we build new facilities, but it should also ensure the survival of the already existing ones, because when a city cinema is closed, not every resort is willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the unfilled financial funds intended to support operators: the State's maturity can amount to approximately EUR 10 million.
It is also shameful from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
In order to maintain the market, €16-18 million per year would be needed".
The case of Bologna deserves special attention. This is the first Italian city, which, in its concerns about closures, has decided to address the problem by means of an agreement between the municipality and Anec, in order to protect and boost one-off cinema in the outside and downtown region.
The provisions would include tax advantages for operators and benefits for the public in order to facilitate accessibility: viewers can drive into restricted zones and park with preferential tariffs in certain parking areas.
"It does this initiative," says Giuseppe Towerore - "and I hope that other cities, whether by introducing other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
However, it is also certain that traditional cinemas will be able to fight against multiplex rule, they need to improve sound and image quality because today's audience is much more demanding.
The protection of traditional cinema was always an important question for me: the closure of Supercine in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and youth, gave me the spark that led me to finally do the Cinema Paradiso, even though I've been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome 25 years ago, so when I go to the closed Rialto or Quirinale, so that I don't see posters covered from the dust, I'll turn my head around.
Close lines between politics and the 'ndrangheta, arrested Mayor of Giovanni Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piro model clan in municipal decisions".
There have been serious accusations against the Governors of the Calabrian Anti-Mafia Directorate, the mayor and Vice-Chairman Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrio and Rosario Schiavone, as well as the Mayor of Rosano against Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning for the charge of external participation in the criminal system.
Bilinks went to Gioaccino Piro, the senior broker between the clan and the administration, and the lawyer's nephew named the boss, who had previously been convicted of taking part in a mafia-like crime association, and 10 million euros of compensation.
"All legal and moral rules, which are more good taste", are written by state prosecutors. The two local authorities have expressed their intention to pay Piro model lawyers an advisory fee.
"So the clan would have been officially present at the town hall, which would have given more opportunity to control and control the administration, which could already be significant.
Agazio Loiero, president of the Calabrian region, does not hide that in the region there is "a number of cooperation between local institutions and organised subworlds": There are areas where the spread of Mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where the co-operation is not necessarily inevitable.
Many local politicians, however, resist the pressure of 'ndrangheta,' they are the heroes who remain clean.
This morning's arrests continue the events in July, when the police announced that they had developed the Piro Model clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were exempted from their mandate for the administration of the municipality. Gioia Tauro's municipal committee was once divided in 1991, even because of the alleged concentration between organised crime and local government.
Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione of the Christian democracies at the time of disintegration, in the second round of 2006, the right-wing coalition was put in place.
Botrány cried when County Hall ordered the dispersal of the municipal council.
The Minister of Home Affairs then referred Marco Minnii to the Court of Justice and accused him of designing everything for political purposes, but in the order of arrest signed this morning, the court explained that he was afraid to call for changes to the A3 project.
The interview with Dal Torrion shows - the state attorneys say "it was desirable to meet the demands of a large group of entrepreneurs representing the Piro model family, known to be close to the family, to submit the decisions of the government to the clans."
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come.
An inextricable source of energy that accounts for 70 percent of the planet's surface, and which is still being discovered by large international energy companies
Hulls, sea currents, currents and renewable energy sources, with giant eyes like Chevron, who are now trying to put their hands on it.
For hundreds of years, they've been researching how to generate energy from the movements of the sea. In the '70s, research has increased during the first oil crisis.
Around 1980, when oil prices decreased, the idea of using marine energy was set aside, but today the demands on the environment and the re-emergence of oil prices will give the sector a new impetus.
According to the World Energy Council (WEC) of London in 2007, 15 percent of world's electricity demand could be covered by marine wave facilities.
This amount is twice what nuclear power plants are currently producing.
In addition, the currents and the currents would still be there.
The giants are down.
Enersis was the first company to commit itself to marine energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power plant to be established in Northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary move when the signature was announced.
It's been two years since then, and it's been two years, and it's been two years, and it's been more and more companies, including those who have been committed to traditional energy.
"The Chevron is studying the energy-using technologies of the oceans and considering the possibility of cooperation with us," said the spokesperson of one of the associated companies in the US oil industry, Wall Street Journal.
The cooperation in question shall concern the acquisition of an authorisation for the launch of the Alaskan project by the US Energy Committee for the exploitation of marine energy.
The matter is not of minor importance, especially if we consider that the US is carrying out oil extraction in Alaska, and even President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
Besides Chevron, the Verdant Power Inc. in New York and Ocean Power in New Jersey are also on the way to the sea. The amounts so far invested, as far as the details are known, are evidence of increasing interest.
The technology's waiting to be developed.
According to experts, we are talking about initial technology for now only because the energy generated from the sea does not dispel any doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing facilities such as Portugal or Scotland are both small size and therefore do not cause too great a problem with the ecosystem.
However, in order to produce energy in a larger scale, there is a need for facilities with a significant environmental impact.
There are various options: Ocean Power uses, for example, a combined bond system.
The push-ups created by waves and moving them up and down are transformed into hydraulic pressure by plungers and cylinders installed inside them.
Pressure's turning a turbine, which feeds a generator.
The electric current will be on the land on the cables that are drawn under the sea.
So far, there are four similar installations at the planning stage that are already waiting for the federal licence, some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, however, has already started energy production for a shopping mall and a parking lot with six submersible turbines located in the East River Sea of New York.
When the electricity is poured, the water's movement turns the turbines' shovels, and this rotation feeds the generator.
Verdant has said that he has a long list of partners who are waiting only for permission to use energy.
There's a flood after the fumes.
At present, the attention given is worthy of the possibilities to be used by the current.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, the current is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or waves, so it can be considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states spent 7.5 million dollars in 2008 to exploit the energy supplied by the current, which is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
