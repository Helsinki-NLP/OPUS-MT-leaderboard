Eemeli Kouki led Hurrican to his home victory in the second victory for Savo Volley.
After seven consecutive men's volleyball medals in Hurricane-Loimaa began the season with the 2018-19 home victory when Raision Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
From Romania to Finland the general player Eemeli Kokuki was 22 points the most efficient of Hurricane.
There were some rites for foreign countries, but they didn't come true, and then there came a call from Loimaa.
We got a deal together pretty fast, Kouki said.
Like Kouko, Tomi Rumpleen's support was played at 18 points in Loimpus.
The most effective of the guests was a match-by- game-by-play country team driver, Samuli Kaislasalo, with 17 points.
The victory of the opening game is always important.
Many players also had experience on the opposite side, and it brought extra ecstra into the game.
Our game is not ready yet, but, of course, continuing the medal pipe is a goal, Kouki said.
The most effective of the rotous Savo Volley
Miro Määtänen was 18 points of Savo Volley's most effective when the team knocked down the Vantan Ducks 3-0.
Our game was admirable, especially at the head of the attack, but fortunately, we got a bit of a bit of a win.
At least I didn't have any knowledge of different downloads when I was playing against my former team, Mättänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his three-series career in the airball in the period 2000-01, made 12 points.
Chief coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with a number of things.
Hall was a small, or atmosphere in the ceiling all the time.
That's a good file. It's a home invasion.
Miro was a king. He played a good game too, Tuovinen said.
Siltalan's previous season in the league was 2006-07, then he won the silver in Pielavede Sammo, when he was still the chief coach.
Thiago Maciel was the most effective at Ducks' 14 points.
Mikkonen again Star of Aka-Volely
In the period 2012-13, Joni Mikkonen, who won the league's point market, has also started this period strongly.
The searcher made 25 points when Aka-Volely took the season after the fall of Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has begun well from its own point of view.
Today, of course, there was a loss near, because we were four times down 17-21.
And the fifth lot came in at the same time, Mikkenen said.
A few years ago, the Tigers' most effective was 28 points made by the hacker Edvarts Buivids.
Landman Alexander Kudrjashovs supported with 17 points.
They didn't get much touch on the guy's hacker, Mikonen said hello.
Finland in comparison with human capital, World Number One
Finland is at the top of the world in comparison with human capital, says Science magazine Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was the first of the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, Holland invested one higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, the worst comparisons were based on Niger and South Sudan.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population will be considered.
The World Bank has brought human capital into line with economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois held Atletio in control, the local game ended in goalless
The Real Madrid goaltender Thibaut Courtois spent a lot of glorious events, and the local game of the Madrid teams ended up in a goalless game late on Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico from Madrid Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but Courtois, Belgian Governor, had been able to fight.
Courtois played at Atletio in three ways on the loan pesette while in Chelsea's player.
In the first week of the International Football League Fifa chose him as the goalkeeper of the year.
The best destination in Real was Gareth Bale, but his launch was over at the end of the finish line.
After the break, Bale was able to switch because of the injury to travel.
According to ESPN, the disillusioned Real supporters called on the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, who moved to Juventus.
In the United States, we are now attacking abortion law, a powerful documentary tells us why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine Members of the Supreme Court could be chosen by President Donald Trump as candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican party, many hope that the decisive vote of Kavanaugh will be brought to an end by a decision known as Roe versus Wade, which made the U.S. abortion legal in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg documentary Reversing Roe - United States and abortion rights tell us how the current situation has been over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the topic is also current in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (in) has done public work against a safe abortion and has received various support from the majority of representatives of our country.
At the beginning of the powerful document, Gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only abortion doctor in Missouri State for the blackmail of the laws.
The Klinikka armed guard says he's defending US religious freedom.
News videos remind me of the deadly terrorist attacks in clinics.
Let's move to a time when the abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran churchmen’s association guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasons for the interviewed pastor are good, but in fact they are not even needed, the photograph of the woman who died in the abortion itself is enough.
The deaths in the U.S. were about 5,000 years ago.
In particular, the Republican party defended the legalisation of abortions.
Already in 1967, the law on abortion was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later on, in its 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan, a turning point, began to confuse religion with political voters.
His abortions also passed on to his successor George Bush's parents.
And that's what Donald Trump did.
At the heart of the matter, the document is lenient in seeking the basis for the politicalisation of the abortion.
When religious organizations that are in favour of racial discrimination were denied tax freedom, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a stick horse.
Religion has brought exceptional nodes of politics.
In writing this, the U.S. is in a situation where the voice of religious justice, which has been abused by its social harassment, has been chosen by the president who has an abortion, who has chosen the Supreme Court as candidate for Kavanaugh, who is now accused of sexual harassment by several women.
Kavanaugh can gain the power based on a horizontal language station to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israel’s army shot seven Palestinians, including two children at the border with great demonstrations
Approximately 200 Palestinians have died in half a year since Israel has set fire to protesters in the border zone.
The Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border area, says the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children: boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
89 of these were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike in the border zone, when the protestors threw up Israel’s troops with stones and explosives.
The army says that it has begun the use of force that the protestors do not break the border path or try to move to the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza’s demonstrations since March, when the Palestinians started their weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12,000 wounded are vulnerable.
The speakers called for access to the Palestinian families in areas where the Palestinians had to leave when the Israeli State was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one of the Israeli soldiers.
The explosives that were dropped on the Palestinian side with the fields and helium balls have set fire to forest areas and landlands in Israel.
Teemu Santa got a penalty shot. Couldn't get a shot on his own.
Wigan's top couple Chey Dunkley seemed to have cut him down with a tail on the penalty area.
Private Gavin Ward let the game go on.
According to his interpretation, the guarantee was clean.
The theme Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation was left to bother Judge Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty in 85 minutes when Santa was dropped.
Ward showed a penalty, and Mario Vrancic was shaking in 1-0 winning paints.
Santa's made five goals for Norwich in the championship series.
Last Saturday, the last one was born in style against QPR.
I mean, the job tastes like Santa again.
After he lost the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created paint situations, and he was in no need of protection.
Norwich had the fifth fight in two weeks.
The team's going on too far.
There's a five-win tube behind the back.
The pedophile help service was immediately filled with reservations - in Finland about 40,000 will experience interest in children
According to the estimate, two percent of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in pre-aged children.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Up to now, sexual interest in children or young people has been difficult to get help.
The joint SeriE project of the Criminal Service Support Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals to encounter pedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was reported in spring, Sexpo, providing advice and therapy, started to provide e-mail fire and meeting hours very quickly, says Yle.
However, these are promised in the autumn to be released.
Sexual preference for children creates shame for many.
Most of the pedophilic emotions themselves have not been carried out by fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that harass them and make them depressed.
They also hamper normal life, says Yle, a sexual therapist, Patricia Thesleff, who works as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if one child is spared sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Directors of Korea, or Gynaecologist of Congo?
President of the United States as winner of Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may suddenly sound strange, but Trump is one of the most popular winners of the prize.
The background has Trump's role in obtaining North Korea, at least at speaking level, to commit to nuclear pollution.
The largest favorites of peace as Nobel recipients are, on the basis of odds, South Korean President Moon Jae and North Korea's leader Kim Jong, who have met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
Warming between the baskets is significant, as last year the gap was clear.
For years, however, the reward for Kim's nuclear threat and its country with a iron grip would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and on Friday, the peace prize will be the most noticeable.
If the prize is not given to those who have participated in the Korean Peninsula diplomacy, there is one of the top candidate Congolese doctors, Denise Mukwege.
In his hospital, a respected gynecologist has managed thousands of women who were victims of mass rapes in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and have become leading expert in the world.
Mukwege has been working to pay attention to sexual violence, which is a horribing by-product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been seen as a UN refugee organization winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has been told that this year the winner of the prize is 331 candidates.
The names of the candidates are not reported to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if Nobel could.
In May, the journalist asked him in the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself, Trump said he was smiling.
I want to get this done.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued to refer to North Korea's negotiations.
However, there are factors that make Trump Nobel unlikely.
The Nobel Committee of Norway, which decides on the award, has often given recognition to individuals and organisations who represent a liberal democracy and a multifaceted world order - precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen.
In the 21st century, three US politicians have received the prize, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So rewarding Trump would require the Nobel Committee's ideological translation.
Fire notice in the tunnel: Cars behaved like warriors and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic accident in Lohja on 1st of September took place.
Due to the notification, tunnel traffic was cut both in the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that this is a system failure, the fire department is trying to make transport normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the road traffic center said that it could not be opened, because there are drivers in the road with a blind eye and they drive how it hurts, a friend of the firefighter Pasi Keeräinen told the fresh STT at that time.
At that time, the motorway was driven in the wrong direction only after the moment of waiting.
When the first starts to act against the traffic rules, some others often follow after, Tapio Heiskanen, Head of Transport Security, amazes me.
According to traffic rules, motor roads and tunnels must not stop as for urgent reasons.
Traffic safety points out that, in exceptional situations, it is not possible to go to the risk of traffic by distressing solutions.
Alarm vehicles shall always provide the most accessible traffic.
In the opposite direction, driving on the motorway is particularly prohibited, as is the making and withdrawal of the U-turn.
The same prohibitions also apply in tunnels where the headlamps must always be switched on.
It is also prohibited to stop without a compelling reason, as certainly also does parking.
There have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush his snow in his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this action, says Heiskanen on the Road Safety Information.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their party even if the ship was caught on a lake floor.
The Ilves fans carried by the Inland Waterboat M/S Tampere would have wanted to stay on board the boat to continue their victory party, even though the ship had been caught in a lakebed, says Juho Syrja, who was at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, on the way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, took off late Saturday night and got stuck in the base of the old water in Aka.
19 passengers on board and five crew members were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was hurt by friends.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their party on the ship until morning, but it was certainly more reasonable to send them to the port of the firehouse and to the bus home, so Sherjan told the STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the Ilves and HPK match, which ended the 4-3 victory of Ilves.
According to the breeder, a Saturday friend was responsible for the water’s surface in the Oldwater at about half a meter below normal conditions.
The fact that the nearest rivermark was covered in the lumbar waste was also difficult navigation, which is why its reflectors did not normally appear in the dark at faults.
No more collision
The guy took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalme shortly after the ship’s route had been under the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
The greater drama was not linked to the case according to the Syrja, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the event and the impact on the bottom was not due to a more significant impact.
According to the crane, the capture of the bottom has not caused leaks or printings to the ship, and in this vision the cruises of the ship continue normally.
The diver visited the ship on Saturday morning to check the condition before the ship was tow out of the ceiling.
Because of our certainty, we're still on the dock to check that there was no damage, says Sherjan.
Syrja believes that the next cruise to M/S Tampere can be handled in agreement for the next weekend.
The cruise season of the ship goes on to him until the day of independence.
No use for outpatients
The rescue facility received an alarm on Saturday night, after a little bit of 12 months.
The port of Vienna was alerted to take out evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
The friend of the firemaster Matti Willman told me late last night that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to darkness and a pretty heavy wind.
After three Sunday nights, Pirkanmaa rescue facility reported that all persons on board have been evacuated and that passengers have been transferred to Tampere by bus.
In 1957, the cruise iceline was established in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
An accused judge, Trump, who has been accused of thinking and drinking, may be left without the top official.
Brett Kavanaugh, as judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, may well remain without the office he has sought, assesses the programme director, Mika Aaltola, from the Foreign Policy Institute.
To date, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct during their study hours.
According to Aaltola, doubts have brought the Republican Party so much political pressure that President Donald Trump can end up in office with someone else.
In the United States, once in a while, there has been a great deal of conflict with the President’s candidate for the Supreme Court.
In that case, the judge has usually drawn himself, says Aaltola.
This is how the President has been able to keep his face.
A name would rain into a democratic camp.
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the choice of a new judge has become a politically sensitive process.
According to Aaltola, if Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision is likely to rain in the Democratic Party's Lar in the forthcoming elections to Congress.
It would raise the increase in vote among young people and women who would more likely vote on democracy.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge in the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
This is not an opportunity for every President's term, as judges of the Supreme Court in the United States are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired from their own request at about 70 to 80 years of age.
Some of the Republicans have a problem with the name
The U.S. Supreme Court’s case-laws are normally examined in the background, says Aaltola.
Although Trump has ordered the FBI's further investigation for only a week, it can still point out something relevant, according to Aaltola.
Yeah, I think it might.
There's rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that the suitability of Kavanaugh or the inconsistency of the office will still be debated very carefully before the Senate takes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority in the Senate with 51-49 votes, but at least two female Republicanists are thought to be suspicious of Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the name would be put to the vote and the Republicans would lose.
A woman who identified Salisbury as an agent for a military investigation
A Russian woman has informed BBC that she has identified Salisbury as an agent for the Russian military intelligence service of the suspected Russian agent.
On the basis of the photographs, she told me that it was a military intelligence with Anatoli Tshepi, working in GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia told us that they had previously revealed another man suspected of poisoning as Chepiga.
They already said they found evidence that men's current identity is covert personnel.
The BBC group traveled to a village near the border of Russia and China, where Tshepiga grew.
A woman in the village recognized the photos of a young Chepigan Bellingcat.
He identified the same man as the British police, where a man called himself Ruslan Boshiro.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning the former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novithok-hermomyrky in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded, among other things, the honor mark of the hero of Russia in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspect's GRU connection.
The men who suspected of poisoning told the Russian TV interview earlier in September that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Old people throwing bags in the war reform
There is now a living example of what is meant in practice by what is defined by the Sipilä Government to limit the change of the so-called reform.
My birthday Vaala's sote-services are produced by the Oulunkaari municipal community, the former Regional Director of Attendo elected to the Health Service in 2016.
The head of the municipal association is alerting the delegation of power from the limit of change.
If sote expenditure is now rising, the municipality's state aid will be cut in the future.
The centrers of the municipality were stunned, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would put an end to the health centre’s institutional care and to a small unit of memory hospitals.
Home care would be added, which means long distances in Vaala, that elderly people on the outskirts are torn right next to the health centre for "home" treatment.
Attendo trusted the municipality to pay for it clients.
The left was not a bad preparation, but a good public meeting was held, with a great deal of family, close-ups and other parties' councillors.
I have presented the preparations for the military community on how old people are already being treated in the region of Vaala at home most in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
There was also Carina West, from the neighborhood.
The local magazine made a big story about the opportunity, and it once again brought the Oulunkars up on their back legs.
Sote manufacturers do not write any papers about the fact that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting for empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
The trainees only talk about the service set, but do not tell what level of treatment they receive or what type of staff Attendo will take care of the elderly until treatment is taken.
Without a nurse?
Named health centre facilities are closed because there is no doctor’s night care.
Attendo will also come to the doctors of the Vaala Health Centre.
Its example relates how central officials run authorised information into incomplete information and is placed back against the wall with a change limit.
This is how the Central Party emptys the population of Vaala, for who remains safe to live there voluntarily if there is a chance to move away.
Was there one electoral statement in the centre that the whole country is considered inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opened a large-scale musician in Cologne
In Germany, thousands of people in Cologne felt that the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened up a Europe's largest mosque.
Several hundred people had been gathered to the beach of Reinjoki since morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read in the signs of protesters, and fascists were condemned.
A number of demonstrations have been held during the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, and security measures have been tight.
Approximately 10 000 people were expected to protest, among other things, about the human rights situation in Turkey.
Some of Erdogan’s supporters had also been gathered to the close of the large pedestrian.
The police had, however, isolated themselves from the environment of a large musician in the region for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdoga said that her German visit had been successful and assessed the relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel swore on Friday that they would rebuild relations between countries which had deteriorated significantly since the Turkish coup in 2016.
However, Merkel stressed that there were serious differences between countries with regard to, among other things, human rights issues.
Review Around Visiting
Both Henriette Reker and Prime Minister Armin Laschet of the state of Nordrhein-Westfalen withdrew their participation in the opening hours, when the criticism of Erdogan’s visit took place.
30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, told me that he had come to the protest against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice to those who can't go on the streets in Turkey.
They're under arrest, they're killed, and they're under arrest.
For Erdogan, anything that is different from his own thinking is terrorism.
At the last stage of Erdogan's German journey in Nordrhein-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three charges for the murder of a journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the prosecutor told us that three people are accused of murdering Kiciak and this betrothed betrothed betrothed and other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in the investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between politicians and the Italian Mafia.
Police have suspected murders related to Kiciak's investigations.
The case and the article published by Kuciak raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems in the distribution of the Karavian on Sundays in the distribution areas
Due to the flaw of the printing, the Sunday lamb will also have to be mailed as anonymous.
This may be visible in the distribution of the magazine in the distribution of distributions in the distribution of common boxes from external memory.
The situation was the same with regard to the Saturday magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Posting put extra leaf bouquets in the county.
Leaves of other Finnish subscribers are posted separately only on Mondays.
The distribution of these magazines is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut.
Today, editor Arto Nyberg is interviewing Vesa Heilaa directly in her forthcoming discussion programme.
Vesa is in the studio telling us about her coming space trip, which she has already booked in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which was the bank loan needed to pay.
If the original plans were true, Vesa would have gone to space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year by year.
It seems now that after a test flight, which took place in 2014, things are in the hole.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or no later than next year.
Vesa's flight number is 300, which means his journey will be scheduled about one year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and a weightless space is 5 minutes at a height of 100 km, the Finnish astronaut tells us about the future homepage.
At the same address, he also guarantees his desire for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book about space travel, and I saw a Star Trek series on television.
The wars of the stars have been seen, and that's what the idea of...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a harsh master.
Manchester City continued its unlossible journey in the Valoliiga when it fell on Saturday at its home in Brighton for 2-0.
The sixth victory of the governing team in the season is guaranteed by the paint sprays Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to direct the fourth half of the season from his close proximity to an empty goal when Leroy Sanné found him 30 minutes ago on Brighton's goal back.
Agüero raised his own goal portfolio to five when he saw the Brighton defense pieces with Sterling.
The Argentinian was able to place 2-0-loops at the scene of the penalty.
With six wins and one round, City, who started the season, will lead Valoliiga at 19 points.
However, the less played one fight Liverpool is only one point away.
Liverpool meets on Saturday night in his own seventh round match for the three-thirds Chelsea.
Young Societys selected new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Society elected new decision-makers for the next three-year period 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen was elected Chairman of the Committee of the Regions, Mr Petra Mäkeläinen Hämé, and Vice-President of the Committee of the Regions.
The Board was elected to 40 full members and 40 alternate members, the Finnish Youth Society will be informed on Sunday.
The Youth Society meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural hobby to be known for quality and safety.
The Youth Society meeting in Joensuu thus promises three years of action: we keep the doors open for everyone, and we organise equal leisure activities regardless of their place of residence and background, and we support voluntary activities and people on their own path of growth, the Finnish Youth Society tells us in its communication.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikko and amazed Ferrari: "To save a very important driver"
At the Swiss newspaper Blick's interview, Mersu's British player asked if he believed that the release of Kimi Räikkösen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the end of the year.
Hamilton runs Ferrari's second driver, Sebastian Vettel with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari told me that Räikkönen would not continue in the stable next season, while Räikkönen announced that he would move on to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, does not believe that Räikkönen would hit the gloves in the dishes.
I don't think Kimi's gonna change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional, fantastic driver.
He stays one of my favorites and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has told me before that Räikkönen has been one of his superiors.
I don't know if Kim knows this, but when I was young and I dreamt of being number one, I played the F1 game at the PlayStation every day.
I was always Kimi, which is kind of crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian competition.
The race starts at 14 o'clock at the dam at the Mercedes Valteri Bottas.
The newspaper follows the race for a moment.
The A-year-old SM-series Championship of football became a full farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players' strength.
The top serial level of the football boys ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season is played.
Before the turn of 13 a.m., the starting points for the championship were clear: FC Lahti to the Academy is enough for the first time in practice against the point against the Vasa IFK.
To turn around in the last round, the second Ilvesen in the championship must win the PK-35 and the desirable lamb defeat.
However, in practice before the beginning of the week, the Lahtiite Championship was confirmed, since the Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there were one less whales, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
At the break, the Gulfmen led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the pink player's box is that the team has played part in the same players' A-year series, i.e. the P20 series and men's Section C.
The Left IFK has played in second practice against the fall of the whole season.
In the second final round on Saturday, the Vasa IFK will have to win the JBK in a foreign match and hope that Tampere United will lose its own guest match in the Siilijärvi in Toivala.
The car ended up on the roof of Eno, according to the rescue facility, was involved.
The passenger car got out of the way and ended up on Eno in Juttuvarant on Sunday at 9:00 p.m.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were mildly injured, and the rescue facility reports.
Well, good luck with that, it's on the paper.
According to the rescue facility, the road was wet after the rain.
The police force went to the scene of the accident.
Supo is waiting for new ways to find out: Device acquisitions and recruitments already made, planned abroad, will not slow down operations
According to Supo's chief of staff, Antti Pelttar, intelligence has been provided by means of equipment acquisitions and training staff.
At the time of entry into force of the Mediation Act, an increase of approximately EUR 10 million should be permanently added to the budget of the Supo.
The Finnish Defence Police (Supoon) office is already preparing for the full decision on the entry into force of intelligence teams.
Antti Pelttar, head of staff, tells West Media that equipment acquisitions have already been made for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is stunned by a video where she sings in the topless... campaigning for breast cancer awareness.
The superstar Serena Williams of Tennis is going to see you again.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video in his Instagram account where he sings only his hands in front of his breasts, says the news office AFP.
Kappale is the Australian The Divinyls' 1991 hit I Touch Myself.
The video supports the activities of the Australian breast cancer association.
"The Divinyls's global faith reminds women of regular self-controls," Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in a discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the subject touched all women regardless of their skin color everywhere in the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it scares many lives.
Another writer in The Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago when he was 53 years old.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which has been made to honor Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit-and-run song to remind women of her health priority," says Williams.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was released early on Sunday morning.
In the video's comments, Williams is blessed with courage.
Williams left Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
The background is raised in the US's open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams supported the main stage of the match and, among other things, claimed that men would be accepted with a much worse use than female players.
The Chinese restaurant on the mountain path is not suitable for highlanders
In addition to traditional Chinese treats, the restaurant serves great landscapes.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened to the province of Zhejiang China.
It is literally located in a rock language.
You can look down on the forest if you want to.
In the heights of the bright landscape, restaurant visitors will be able to bury their lives in the mountains of Longquan.
Getting to the restaurant requires walking in the middle of the peach trees.
The restaurant opened for passengers on 19.9.2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant's bathroom is located.
It takes a good ground floor for a busy restaurant, and we'll tell you about it.
The basket’s alley race ends today: this is how it ends
Everything will end in time.
Today, that's what happens to the Finnish land drama Korpela's alley race, which has been held quite well.
The third production period has gone like hot stones: last week, the episode viewed the television as a first performance of 722 000 Finns.
The peak figures in themselves no longer have any practical significance, as the Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkkinen series have no follow-up.
In the final period, the relationship between the public and Mirku will be re-enacted, and I think that the mother of the public will guess the first thing to come.
Even between Anssi and Miisa are warm, in light of recent events, directly romantic, but then again Laiho appears.
The police are also on suspicion of a man with a bone.
No one will ever know Laiho's fate in advance.
Anita's gonna get some incredible news on her behalf.
The last will of a long distance comes out, which brings a woman to the brink of tears.
After a week in Sundays, the latest episode of Sorjonen will continue.
I'm going to have a potion on TV1 today at 21.05 p.m.
You think tomorrow we should go to work in a little flu?
Here are the facts for and against
Flu season's hot.
A lot of scars stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether it is appropriate to go to infection, for the disease may be contagious even if its symptoms are minor.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly hit, sometimes they appear on the hip.
In the latter option, you may already be infected by others, even if your symptoms are small, says Prevention.
So you want to stay home?
Prevention indicates that flu is infectious even if the person has no symptoms.
The virus will be infected during the day before the symptoms begin and from five to a week.
Children may be more infected by the disease.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when you have a cough and there's no more fever, says medical professor Gregory Poland.
It is also worth avoiding training.
It's too fast to return to the gym to slow recovery.
In addition, wash your hands, fill your hand with your hand, and throw your trash paper in the trash.
You're sick, though?
If you have to leave your home as a sick person, consider using a protective mask.
The mask doesn't control the viruses, but it keeps the user aware of the head area.
You don't have to put your fingers in your nose or your mouth, Poland says.
Also, the abrasions are limited to the mask.
How, then, can we avoid infection?
The best way to wash your hands is to avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States average human touch their eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland repeats the missionary tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
The hockey player and misses are often connected together.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, on the 23rd floor.
Alina Voronkova, from Pertunmaa, has received the 2018 crown of Miss Suomen.
She lives in Lahti, where she moved when she was 15.
Alina's mother is an Inkerinian and Dad's Russian.
From his father's Russian, Voronkova was persecuted at school.
Mom and Dad moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was persecuted because of my Russianism.
I had no friends in Pertunmaa. Alina tells me about Miss Finland's semi-finalists.
After the upper secondary school, Alina decided to start off a clean table and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the mischief found new friends, and the coffin went to roll with hope.
Then at age 15, he thinks he's an adult, but after that, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Jonah Hurrin, who has been familiar with Pelicans.
After a career with an SM, the hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Championships.
During the early days of the meeting, a couple lived in a long - term relationship almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get to the winner's three, and with that, I would have a career, and I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, we do well in confidence and in a distance the good side is that it will remain at the top of the full - time course, Alina virnistically in May.
From constant growth to joy, death to experience
Almost everyone is concerned about the Earth's sustainability.
Still, there's nothing you don't want to give up.
Sustainable alternatives to continued growth are being sought, but even the theory of a fair economy also runs into major problems.
The continuous growth of the economy has brought to ordinary people during a few generations, especially in the northern half of the ball, a standard of living that could be used for dreams.
However, the long-standing overcapacity of the earth and climate change are a threat to the threat of this market economy's stone foot.
Two men were stabbed against Sunday night in Kannelmus at Sittor at 4:00 a.m.
The man born in 1986 was seriously injured by the stabilization, and the second one, born in 1968 more lightly.
The older men have already gotten out of the hospital.
The police have captured one person whose possible contribution to the stabilization is investigated.
The police are also looking for another suspect related to events.
These events are investigated as a murder attempt and a serious assault.

The home team's head coach, John Allen, said the game was under control, but the goal was to bring pain again.
One defense mistake took a full score from us, Allen was upset.

Restaurant M/S Tampere came to the herd in St.A. - "Absolutely catch up with a rock"
Inland Waterboat M/S Tampere drove to the cattle late on Friday night at the Akakala Saint Lake.
The rescue facility received an alarm about the water traffic accident on Friday night after midnight.
The 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has gone to the truck, and is firmly attached to its bow with a rock, described by the high-end firefighter Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers on board and five crew members.
According to the rescue facility, personal injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are being transferred by bus to Tampere, told by a friend of mine to Chief Jari Nieminen STT at 1:00 p.m. at night.
The port of Vienna was alerted to take out evacuations of passengers.
The ship from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had for some reason drifted off its route to the west of the narrow Jumusensalme.
The police will find out what happened.
A friend of firemaster Matti Willman told me earlier this evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult due to darkness and a pretty heavy wind.
According to the rescue facility, the ship's fate is unclear.
Apparently, the ship's not leaking.
After the evacuation operation, the divers will begin to check the situation on the ground.
M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is currently an inland vessel operating as a restaurant ship with a maximum authorised passenger volume of 180 persons.
There is also a meeting room for private use on board.
According to the ship’s websites, the cruiser has been established in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-maggers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
Robert Helenius's fight against Erkan Teper is a boxer.
Today, Ms. Jaakko Helminen and Deputy Judge Jussi Kokila announced a challenge that Helenius would charge a total of over EUR 80,000 unpaid manager fees with late interest.
According to the application, Helminen and Kokila worked for Helena on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've been trying to settle, but there's no other way.
There has been a clear assignment here, and much work has been done, Kokila says to Ilta-Sanom.
Helen's current manager, Markus Sundman, sent a reply to the Éltlehti, explaining what happened to the boxer's vision.
Helenius denies that he is required to pay the sum required.
According to his response, Kokkola and Helminen had provided their services economically in a difficult situation and promised to be able to organise matches and sponsorships for him.
It was technically agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay the commissions only for a percentage of its matches.
To be honest, Helenius did not have to pay for anything but to receive the income they provided.
This is also a normal and only practice for professional athletes’ manager activities.
The work on wages has never been agreed and would also have been absurd in the situation of Helenus, Sundman will find out in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to his response, Helenius would have wanted to agree the income distribution in writing from the beginning, but Kokkkila and Sundman were not in the form until the end of 2014.
He stated that the proposal itself was a poor one and cut off cooperation with Kokkkila and Helmis.
Helenius didn't spend time with Kokila and Helmi.
A year after the end of the co-operation, Helenus had been assigned a "independent but massive" decline from the manager's work.
This year, the action has been brought on the same claims.
Helenius considers Helminen and Kokkkila to be a poorer function, in exchange.
Helenius is meeting today at Erkan Teper Stuttgart on the seventh edition of IBF's heavy list of interviewers.
Hearty man and good reporter
The entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vaino felt the late radio driver and journalist Erkki Sun for decades.
The long-line radio driver and journalist Erkki Star died of unhealed liver cancer when he was 83 years old.
The declaration of death of the host was published in the Helsinki Word of Sunday.
The report reports the dead of the Sun on 3 September.
The clock told us about a serious illness on its Facebook website in March 2018.
At that time, the publication also saw Ile Vainio, the knowledge of a familiar fate.
He left some goodbyes on Facebook as early as he said, Ile Vainio.
Vainio considers the Erkki Sun to be a multistakeholder who became a great journalist.
He recalls that the Day was a man who had high-speed hotshots and funny things.
I learned to know Erkin when I was a little boy when I was 12 years old, and I started there as a warehouse man.
That's when Erk and I met each other.
He was then reporting the Finnboard and in various tasks, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I went to make albums as a music producer, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was a regular supplier of all the stories about artists at the party.
He was always expert, and I saw the great fire he had on entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got right to the skin of his interviewers.
He was a hearty man and a good reporter.
For many, he became known as Yle's radio driver, but he also wrote brilliant press articles.
Erkki interviewed me several times.
He was good at talking.
Over the decades, Pälli worked as a supplier in Fazer's record company.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's album.
However, the greatest passion for the sun was radio work, where he had a unique style.
He did radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar with numerous audiences in the Yle ether.
The ball retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Federation announced on Saturday that the financial year ended in May showed about 450 000 euros of profit.
The Association describes the 'full translation' experienced in its economic situation, although the economy is, of course, under the burden of 'high debt'.
Managing Director Mika Kulmala encourages rapid response and tight economic discipline.
We reacted as soon as possible last autumn to take adaptation measures.
Careful planning and economic management of the operation has been hit through our entire organization, Kulmala explains in the brochure.
We have also managed well in partner procurement and, moreover, in the past period, the world's profits were maximum.
However, in the future, cost management must also be precise and, at the same time, we must constantly look for new funding models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then I got quiet.
Ten thousand bodies lying in the back yard of the hospital Please, in the city of Indonesia, on the Sulawes island.
Only one building separates them from the area which has been assembled for the purpose of assessing the need for surviving injuries and treatment.
Patients should also be treated outside due to post-surgical episodes.
One of those who moved in the hospital was 52 years old, a returner of Baharaddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he only uses one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
Last time I talked to him when he was going to school, Baharadd told AFP.
In the military hospital’s yard district in Palus, Dwi Haris lay, who has been injured by his back and arm.
He was at a local hotel with his wife and daughter when he started the quake.
The family was invited to Palu's wedding party.
I was probably under a wall that collapsed into the bites.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then I got quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe, and Haris told the AP that they're using British meth.
You're looting small stores.
Please, at the evacuation center, 35-year-old baby's mother, Risa Kusum, tried to calm down her hot baby.
He described the feelings in the city as passions.
Clean water is scarce.
Small stores are being robbed everywhere, and Kusum told me.
Many citizens Please have slept outside or in temporary bambuds.
Even if the house was so well standing, possible extremisms could destroy it permanently and bury the inhabitants in the ground.
According to the news office AP, more than half of the prisoners in prison ran away after the prison walls collapsed.
The prisoners were known to be about 560, so there may be about 300 fugitives.
Also, the prisoners of Donggala prison have escaped, says The Jakarta Post.
According to the magazine, the prisoners were furious and set the prison on fire after the guards had refused to leave to seek out their relatives who were suffering from the earthquake and the tsunami.
The airport has been reopened mainly for aid flights.
Among the first ones, the army's C-130 transporter landed on the field, bringing relief supplies.
Commercial flights Please only be allowed limited to the field.
The pilots are forced to land on the field without the air traffic control help, as the air traffic control tower was damaged by a severe earthquake.
Rain wipes over Finland at night
The whole country is spread across the country in the same night as Sunday into a long area of rain from the direction of the West, reports the Institute of Air Sciences.
The rain will be mainly water, but it is expected that the Central and North Lap will have to travel or snow.
The previous night’s chips are not repeated because temperatures below cloud cover remain higher.
More cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures pretty effectively in control.
Right in the west, you can go to the side of the pack, said your friend, the meteorologist, Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain area will be drawn eastward in the morning.
South and west have some pebbles or half-pillars.
In the afternoon, temperatures are always moving up to Oulu's altitude at 10-13 degrees.
The first week looks similar to the south and mid-west of the country on behalf of thermal facilities, but the weather is becoming more unstable.
There are wind and wave warnings in maritime areas.
There are no real storms of guilt expected for the next few days, but otherwise there is a typical autumn change in weather.
It's not like the fall, it's really starting to kiss on it, but Ilkka said it.
Miss Finland is not seen on TV
IL-TV allows you to follow Miss Finland's red carpet glamour and sparkle.

We were hoping he could go to college before he left for the Massives.
The Russian Dimitri father and the Inkerian Svetlana mother believed in their daughter's success in Miss Finland.
New Miss Alina Voronkova's parents, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, were proud to follow her daughter's next few moments.
They snuck into the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the final.
It's a wonderful feeling!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before it came out, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Inkerian and Dimitri's Russian.
Alina speaks of a smooth Russian, even though she has lived in Finland as a whole.
Svetlana says that Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than Miss's career.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, she should be a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio walker.
Only later, Alina got excited about the beauty contest.
The parents wanted Alina to attend the university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
That's what happened, and eventually Alina wanted to make her degree before the Massors.
We asked him why he wasn't involved last year, but he wanted to finish the cover.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she has a healthy example for young people and adults.
He's brave and eating healthy.
And Alina likes to be on display, you see.
Alina's boyfriend, Jonah Hurri, is playing hockey in Japan, and she couldn't get to Finland to encourage me to love in the final.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship between young people lasts for a decade.
Yes, that's what it's meant to be!
My parents wanted my daughter to come by soon.
It's been such a long break for the missionaries to visit.
I'm sorry, but there's been some kind of messages.
A young man died in a drive-by in Lahti. The police took three people.
According to the police, three people have been arrested for the event.
The Hämeen Police did not comment on the course of events on Saturday, nor on the possibility of overdoing intent, calling for an in-depth examination.
Nor did the police comment on whether or not the captured persons and the dead man were aware of each other’s past.
Further information on the case is available at the earliest at the beginning of next week.
Sari Pippo left his career in Brussels and became his home mother in Finland - the idea of a cartoon in mind: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
At one time, my husband left for an ex-Sari Pippo, where he proposed to be a person in the story I developed, says the upstairs cartoon blogger, home mother and former EU translator.
According to Sari Pippo, in Brussels, he was an EU translator in economic and legal matters until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I've had a real good time at home.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to my mind that what you would do when the little kid was already big.
And then, in 2014, there was a comic book.
It tells us that he had never dreamed of making a cartoon, even though he had read Aku Ankka, Tintti, and Asterix.
Last time I was a child, I had drawn, but when these manuscripts were started, the situation changed.
At first I did some dozens of manuscripts in the tablebox.
My daughter Vivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a good artist, but I did not get her attracted until summer 2016, when I donated the delay with the help of the drawing plate.
His zeal lasted a dozen stripes, and then it had to start trying to laugh at Pippo, which tells him that he was a great incentive.
The drawing plate is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw the paper, so Pippo tells me about his relationship, which he usually does at night.
I keep thinking of manuscripts, but I usually don't prepare at once.
One of the three square stripes takes up to several hours.
I might do a screen at a time and play with the color.
Starting a drawing is always the hardest, because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Pippo tells us that he appreciates modern series of newspapers including Scott Adams Dilbert.
The human beings are the mother of a carrot-faced raccoon who has a salad-haired softness.
Other people are Man, Pissis and Twoos.
In the human world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from their own lives and social media.
A series of Pippo does not want to preach or offer an obsessive bull, even if there is a point between the animal body and the animal body.
The hideout tells us that he reads his series with his husband and children.
I mean, it's such a great feeling when you look at the comic book you're drawing, and you're saying that I've done this today.
And there's plenty of challenges for your mother!

The earthquake in Indonesia: The flight manager sacrificed himself... did not leave a cracking tower until hundreds of passengers were safe.
Anthonius Gunawa Agang, a 21-year-old flight manager, has emerged as a hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agang was left alone in the air traffic control tower until he was able to transport hundreds of passengers safely from the island that was being hit by the earthquake.
The young man was on the turn of the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in town, where the earthquake struck on Friday.
As the rest fled from the air traffic control tower, Agang refused to leave his place before being directed from the runway of Batik Air's passenger plane to the air.
Thus he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Air Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport Saturday after the earthquake.
The flight control tower was waving and cutting.
Finally, Agang tried to save himself by jumping out of the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke and he was seriously injured.
Agang was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was supposed to be transporting helicopters better to the equipment facility, but he died 20 minutes before the arrival of the helicopter, the aviation administration representative told The Jakarta Post.
The excitement was further increased after the flight got into the air, and its intensity was finally measured at 7.5 magnetites.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian aviation administration has respected Agang's heroism in social media.
Mr Reh's reflection on the end of Europe's trade war: "We need to look at the following receipts"
The war between the US and China is reflected in the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated all over Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic performance.
President Olli Rehn said at Ylen's first reading that although the tightening tension does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which is reflected in company investment decisions.
The situation also applies to exports of Finnish companies.
Mr Rehn said that Europe is a good man for now.
It has been able to build a peace of mind with the United States, and it has also calmed the situation with China and Japan.
Europe does not seem to be cooling down the feet of the trade war.
We have to look at the next receipt and then evaluate it.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in Washington's mouth, but he said at Yle's interview.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of these is the third largest national economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most debt countries in the euro area and in the western world.
Yesterday, the market reacted brutally on Thursday night by the Italian government to show clearly the deficit budget.
Next year's deficit is more than 2.4 per cent of national production.
Mr Rehn regards the situation in Italy as worrying.
Five per cent of the country's loan is problem credit and there are more than 10 per cent of unorganised credit.
Moreover, its public finances are weak and the country seems to be once again overcoming its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting new crises yet, Rehn replied when he was asked whether Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another thing that is trying for Europe is the British gap between the EU and the EU.
Rehn was hoping it was in the line.
The difference would have a much more negative impact.
Rehn began as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, the President of the European Central Bank (ECB) will withdraw from his role in a fair year's time.
His successor's conversation has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen's name have been advocating speech.
It's probably okay if Finnish names are involved, Rehn said and added that he's not going to comment on it further.
HS super popular Black box performances continue next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black box performances organised by Helsinki Words continue to start again in the week.
Other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on 2, 8 and 11 October.
October 23, Black box will visit the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets to the National Theatre for sale.
The Tampere performance is complete.
Tickets are sold by Flag.fi.
During the evening, suppliers and photographers on the stage will tell a story they have long prepared, which has not previously been published in any HS tool.
There's another thing that nobody's ever heard before.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report on the other side of the earth, and a story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet HS suppliers and photographers and to continue the discussion.
Helsinki Words have arranged the nights of living journalism for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often finished.
More than 15,000 people have already seen this view.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier Gala as a year's journalistic act.
The awarders thanked the new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
Spring 2019 Black box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The performance will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The performance we will see at that time has a different content than in this synthesizing evenings.
The missing sensitizer was found thanks to the "exposureless experiment"
Finnish police Drone is the world's peak: "We're being asked about training."
According to the Head of Police College, the police may use drones in addition to the search for missing persons, for example, in crime investigation and intelligence.
On Tuesday, Oulu's police managed to find a drone from a missing in Raahe only in a few minutes.
Director Kimmo Himberg of Police College of Applied Sciences referred to the case and mentioned, among other things, that "through an unprejudiced experiment and effective training, we are also at the top of the world".
Drone is quite a new one, and even more recent in police work.
There is no record of the Finnish police being the champion of the use of drones.
Himberg says there's a strong feeling that this is the case.
For example, this has been resolved when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported at international events.
There's a lot of interest in it somewhere else, says Himberg.
There would be a lot of visitors looking at the Finnish police's drones.
They're asking us for training.
More and more
Himberg points out that finding a lost person in winter conditions in Finland is very important as soon as possible.
As noted, in Raahe's case, the lost were found with drone only in a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone planes.
Himberg says there's more to be trained.
Already, the drone is used a lot in police tasks, and its use will become more frequent and will increase in the future.
I'd dare say this, Himberg tells me.
In addition to looking for missing persons, the police may, according to Himberg, use drones for example in an accident or crime scene investigation and in certain types of intelligence.
For example, there is a need to look at some area a little further, where it is possible to fear that violence will be faced there.
Drone can be used for prior investigation.
Karjalan Rugby rose to the 1st divar
Karjalan Rugby party in Kuopio on Saturday, 2nd division victory.
The Joensuuns were still in the middle of the match with 7-12 hits for Helsinki Rugby Club, but they found a line in the second phase and whispered the South guests from 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew about the historic rise of Karjala Rugby to his 1-division.
In the past, the association has played in the first, but at that time the Finnish rugby serial activity had been divided into two levels, the SM series and its multi-page 1-division.
The Society is going to take out the serial site, but next winter, it knows quite a bit of work.
The current racer of less than twenty players must be raised to 25.
The 1-division also knows how to increase the number of games and the longer to play trips, so it must also be consistent with that.
Kotkaniemi to start the season in Montreal, to strengthen the head coach
In the hockey NHL, the head coach of Montreal Canadiens, Claude Julien, confirmed with the Twitter account that the Finnish eater Jesper Kotkaniemi, will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super-licence at the Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round of three summer bookings.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength from the end of the season and has provided strong grips in September's training matches.
Kotkaniemi was able to score immediately in her first practice match.
The major coach Julien said that he had taken a big development scene in Finland after arriving at the office.
The NHL regular series begins next week against Thursday night in Finland.
Montreal meets Toronto Maple Leafs on the opening round.
What is a good leader?
This week much has been said about leadership in Finland.
In the interview with HS, the Government of Nokia, Risto Siilasmaa, the president of the Government, reported that Paranod was an optimist in which he enlightened the philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of Jorma Ollla, his predecessor.
Mr Olila was very critical of the accusations, but even earlier, the Nokia reports have mentioned the inability of leaders to act as a team; fear and inefficiencies that caused the collapse of mobile business.
The company's rise in risk-taking capacity and agility disappeared.
At the week in Helsinki, a giant business event was held in Nordic Business Forum, which pulled the cream of Finnish business life to the Exhibition Centre.
In addition to Barack Obama, the stage rose 12 business stars.
That's enough talking about good management.
The legend of leadership, Gary Hamel, said that a good leader must dare take the company to the future, even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most spiritually tied to past decisions.
John Mackey, the founder of a wide range of famous Helle Foods trading chain, said that the manager should be able to communicate to the entire staff the purpose of the company.
And that can't just be the purpose of making profit to the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about the success book's introverties, told me that the most successful leaders are well founded.
They act calmly, silently and determinedly.
Often they're introverts.
Professor Aswath Damodara pointed out that the characteristics of a good leader must be met with the company's life-cycle phase.
At the beginning of the company, the director must be able to tell the story on which the company's future is based.
A company that grew into a mature phase needs a leader who knows the numbers.
In Nordic Business Forum, 7 500 visitors listened mainly to Finnish leaders.
As a risk, they had an information shock.
A lot is required from a good leader.
That is why management is so often wrong, including at the highest level.
There were Sillasmaa and Ollla.
They talked to each other in the bowls, so to speak.
However, they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy for an outsider to judge.
Sara Chafak came to a great red carpet directly from Los Angeles to spend most of his years abroad.
The model Sara Chafak arrived in the mistinent black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland-like dress also had a long-lasting wave.
A little bit of jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles.
Long ago, I spend most of my time there, and Chafak tells me what I'm talking about.
Chafak tells me he's going to L.A. in the auditions.
He's been doing advertising, amongst other things.
In the United States, he describes his work as interesting, as well as similar to that of Finland.
Although he says that work must be done harder, the model can always be easily replaced.
You have to kiss harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreography for Sony Lindfors €30 000 live art award in Kuopio
The artist Sonya Lindfors won a 30 000 euro cultural prize on Saturday in Kuopio.
Lindfors, awarded by the International Prize for Live Art, is working on choreography, social activation and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors art is vital to its immediate environment.
His work allows others to work and create spaces for dialogue with the environments they have previously lacked, the track described the winner.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, the award candidates were a number of international artists.
The award shall be awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group operating on the field of live art.
The Danish police found a major operation on Volvo: "We can't tell you where."
The large-scale searches of the Danish police have produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, the traffic was closed on the bridges of the Jutetram and the Iso-Belt.
All land and ferry transport from the island of Själlän was closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere to Denmark.
Police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS has reached the Head of Media Centre of Copenhagen.
We've found the car we've been looking for.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet. Henrik Storm from the Copenhagen police report tells Ilta-Sanom.
According to Storm, the black Volvo we've been looking for has no direct contact with the police.
He says the greatest danger is over.
The Danish extra Bladet told me about the police's Saturday information meeting.
Detective Jørgen Bergen Skov was the most silent operation.
He didn't want to tell you what criminal name they were investigating.
However, Skov told me that this is a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people's lives.
We've been looking for three people.
The police won't tell me if they're already caught.
According to the paper, restrictions on ferry transport have been withdrawn.
The Copenhagen police also followed events on their Twitter account.
However, the STT tells us that the general public no longer has any cause for concern, as the threat was directed at certain people.
The name of Macedonia has caused decades to waste - now the people will vote on it in the contested elections.
In Macedonia in the Balkans, the proposal is currently being put to the vote as a new name for the country.
According to the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek Governments, the Republic of North Macedonia would become a name.
Greece has so far prevented Macedonia from becoming a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonian belongs to its northern province.
On the issue of the referendum, there is no new name, but let us ask whether the voter is in favour of the EU and NATO membership of Macedonia by adopting an agreement.
The vote began online at least at the school in the centre of Skopje, the capital city.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, hoped for support from the agreement.
A referendum means a change if it opens doors to Europe and NATO.
That means change especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, independent Macedonia has been designated by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in official contacts.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the adoption of the Agreement.
The national right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has again called for a referendum.
In addition to the result, it is exciting to see whether there will be more than 50% vote.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of yes or no votes would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
The amendment of the Constitution is required by a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
The Greek Parliament must also accept the agreement.
The polling stations will be closed from the 8th to the Finnish time.
That's a great victory!
Robert Helenius knocked Erkan Teperin
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper late on Saturday night in a heavy professional box in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finnishist measured his 36-year-old German opponent in the Waldenbuchi corner of Stuttgart.
Last night's main point was the heavy Intercontinental title match of the IBF union.
Its winner can open up the opportunity to gain access to more difficult tasks that are seen on Saturday, whose economic importance is significant.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth round, when he smote Teper with his hard left hand.
Teper couldn't get out of the floor anymore.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent already in the third round, when the German nose started bleeding.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They had to fight already in December 2015.
Then Teper appealed to the injury and withdrew from the fight.
Then it turned out that the German had cut twice in the doping test.
Helenius has taken his name from his professional career matches 28 matches and suffered two losses.
Teper, who went to the game as a clear favourite, won 19 professional matches and lost three times.
With Hamilton's stable order to win, the difference was 50 points already.
The Formula One Championship approached its confirmation again, as Mercedes Lewis Hamilton won Russia's gp and pulled his MM line to Ferrari Sebastian Vetelt 50 points (306-256).
There are five more races left.
I'm going to race Valteri Battas from the stakeout. He was driving the second time.
Last year in Sotsh, Bottas, who took his career in the opening victory, held a leading position for the midways of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to let him pass Hamilton.
Vettel drove third, Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bullin's Max Verstappen was the fifth to launch the last base line.
The two assaulted a Jew man in Joensuu... caught a block away.
Two men were assaulted and kicked from a 31-year-old Jew in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6 p.m.
According to the police, men also had the victim's phone.
The police reached out to the suspects, or a 35-year-old man and a 39-year-old man in a joy suit shortly after the event.
They were captured by a suspected robbery, the police say.
The victim was injured, which did not require medical attention.
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, is leaving his role as Chairman of the Board of the Company.
Musk has agreed with the U.S. authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined for $20 million in his suites to make sure that he had made a financial contribution to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange.
The U.S. Securities Commission, SEC, has accused Muskie of fraud in securities.
Musk will continue to be CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay fines of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is laid down in law.
Canada is fighting against time to reach agreement with the United States on Nafta
In the middle of the negotiations between the United States and Canada, the free trade agreement with NATO threatens to end.
The United States has set the threshold for Sunday, and national negotiators have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's chief adviser, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to be able to focus fully on trade negotiations.
On President Donald Trump's demand, the United States, Canada and Mexico started negotiations about a year ago on the reform of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
At the end of the August, Mexico and the United States reached agreement, but the agreement with Canada has not yet been established.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before the Mexican presidential elections won by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador take office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that it is not necessary to involve Canada in the agreement.
He has previously informed Congress that the plans have to sign the agreement at the end of November - whether Canada was involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the US and Canada should be ready on Sunday so that the US Congress can have sufficient time to evaluate it.
The neighbor thought the candles' spell was a fire in the Cocoa. The fire department was alarmed.
The candles burned in the flat house in Oulu Kaakuri caused a fire alarm on Sunday night.
A dozen rescue units were alerted to the ground due to a possible burn.
It was found that candles burned in the sauna of the flat had appeared to the opposite house from the fire, and therefore had been notified to the emergency center.
There was no fire at the scene.
Police picked up 11 people after the Honka-HJK match... looting at the field and the metro station.
The police captured eleven people on Saturday after the Honka-HJK match with the men played in Espoo, the police chief of the Western Uusimaa Police Department, Teemu Värrinen, confirmed the STT.
It was based on the protection of crime and interference.
The ones I took were released after the situation was calmed, Värtinen said.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Game over, 0-0.
After the final review, a large number of viewers rushed into the field from the watch provided to the HJK supporters.
The situation led to plucking and fist fights between team supporters.
They needed horsemen, for example, to stop the situation.
In addition to the field, looting took place in the area of a nearby metro station, where part of the captures also took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw in the pictures was an unpleasant situation, Värtinen referred to the ruins that took place on the field.
According to the dye, no criminal record has been made as a result of the events.
The table was agitated by the butterfly’s SE time in the World Cup, Laukkunen’s swim to the final.
Jenna Lakkanen and Riku Tablestone have moved to the finals on the final day of World Cup 3/7 competitions in the Netherlands.
I'm gonna swim in Eindhoven on a short track.
The board of HSS was ashamed of Finland’s record of 50 meters of butterfly, where he was the second in the early days of 22.82.
Previously, in September, Tablevivi was swimming in Helsinki at the age of 22,77.
Ari-Pekka Liukonen, representing Espoo, was a butterfly of 24s during the 24th time.
The Swimming Club Vuukatin Laukkunen was 50 metres in the beginning of the sixth time in 30.48 and moved to the final.
In the beginning of the two hundred metres of confusion Laukkunen was 15 in time 2.14,25.
Students act as a rare treat: ancient tragedy - affronted Oresteia influences its visual appearance
The ancient tragedy is rare in Finnish scenery.
For example, the National Theatre has recently seen ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktes, in 1988.
Now, the Theatre School brought an ancient entire playtrilogy, Aiskhylos Oresteia, to the tour beginning of the National Theatre.
In the projects that started in 2015 the Lava is open! The actors at the Theatre University are working with the professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
The international first night of Oresteia was awarded in April in Berlin.
Reconciliation of Roihan from Orestia will sum up the report on the end of the blood collection of the destroyed Atreus family and the origin of the rule of law to 20 minutes, in particular by means of an increase in chorus shares.
The work succeeds in being very loyal to the spirit of the Simon great Finnish (2003).
The revelation that reveals the dramatic lights and the theatre’s pages highlight the purely and bright scenery idea.
Its centre has alternately the dynamics between the performances of the chorus, the protagonists of the nominal roles, and the choir.
The presentation uses both double and triple seats for nominal roles.
The actors do not leave the scene at all, so, for example, the murders of the Agamemnon returning from Troija war and of this island of war Kassandra are shown on the stage, unlike the ancient drama.
Of course, the presentation does not point out that he is loyal to the ancient presentation strategy.
Rather, a modern, loyal interpretation of the text, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots, is created before the viewer’s eyes.
Roiha has succeeded in raising the rhythms of a large group of actors in the field as a single organism.
Especially in chorus parts for very expressive, ostrich-like group formations, the actors who tend to get their rights naked, only by decorating the white front row, on the stage.
That's impressive.
The Orestean performance tour continues to be held in Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen shell
The future will begin to be seen in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyinda and the Swiss H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published in the Hannover IAA vehicle exhibition, Hyundai will deliver a thousand car lots of novelty models for the use of the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing on the market a fuel-fired truck, Hyundai continues Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models by referring to the road as a vehicle manufacturer.
This is the quality of the world's first project we are taking the fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the fuel grid, the Vice President of Hyundai Motor, In Cheol Lee, said the contract in the public domain.
The fists were on several occasions in Kajaan.
A little over thirty men assaulted three men at a restaurant in central Kajaan and on Saturday nights.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, which led to his removal from the restaurant.
On the outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and, in the absence of a third man, the assaulter also hit him.
The police caught the assault officer.
At the police station, a man was still aggressive and kicked another cop in the leg.
He also threatened the police by assaulting and killing.
The man was taken to calm down.
The matter is investigated as three abuses and a violent opposition to an official.
In the middle of Kajaan, there was another case of assault on Saturday night.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
At first, about 20-year-old Kajaan man hit the victim.
A little later, another man took him down, and the man who hit him earlier still kicked the victim.
The outsiders pulled the assaulters away from the victim and they called the police.
But before the police arrived, the killers were already able to leave.
Police are asking witnesses to contact the Kajaan police by telephone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail to investigate.kainuu@polisi.fi.
Long line radio driver Erkki The Sun is dead
As a long-term editor, Erkki Sun, known as the editor, died of cancer at 83.
Radio pilot Erkki, 83, is dead.
He died of unhealed liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
It's all over now.
Even the doctor has said that, I live one day at a time, she commented on her situation in the evening newspaper a month ago.
The security of trade aunts and uncles must be guaranteed.
For the first time in 1984, I received a newspaper deal.
When a case gets astounded in these annual rings, it's usually about the big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the security of retail workers, I was astonished and, at times, a little angry.
I also spoke about the issue of the Trade Union of Services (PAM) working environment expert Erika Kääärä.
He says the crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, claim otherwise.
The police report only clearly serious cases and many of the real violent situations are not reported.
"It is, of course, for companies to have a duty to statistics on their situation in the near future on the basis of the Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and not to collect their data anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries don't end in the statistics.
In situations of violence, the problem has always been that they do not always become physical injuries.
Still, psychiatric traumas can be far more serious than bruises and wounds.
It is difficult to draw the gap between the violent situation and the threatening violent situation, when even a certain level of aggressive threats must be considered violence - even if there is no access.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, even though the actual work does not happen.
Some areas of residence are restless.
The store has acquired guards.
When the opening hours of the shops were released, the media also had a high degree of suffocation on its effects on the security of the sellers.
"Then a lot of employers arranged security services for at least night-time feelings and to prevent work alone", says Hähärä.
If nothing happens, the wrong conclusion will be drawn.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this will produce a new negative trend.
As a result of security, when the disturbances remained well in possession, the image was that security would be unnecessary.
Now, many places are being tried to find solutions to remove expensive security services.
Mild assault is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that the victim who has become victimized does not want to request an investigation of a criminal who usually lives in close proximity to trade.
However, the same, according to the law provided for in 2011, will become subject to the prosecution if it occurs at the workplace.
I think we're going to need a few preliminary cases now.
Next time you trade aunt or uncles are being assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should charge you.
When the court put a few assaulters in jail, and the sentence from the hard end of the penalty scale, customs would be fined.
A society where the food trade must be open to small-time municipalities almost overnight must guarantee the safety of trade workers.
Heidi Sohlberg signed up for Miss before the start of the direct transmission - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
Missi's crown is not seen in traditional ways on TV this year, it's a broadcast that shows the Viafree site.
The mission is run by Miss Heidi Sohlberg and the host of the Viaplay NHL and KHL studios Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet as a plotter are Janni Huss.
Before the direct broadcast, three of the pilots told the callers who arrived and the media representatives about the cost of the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the public to give Harjumaa a handfuls.
Now all women scream!
Now look at this man-in-law of ours, Sohlberg cheered his colleague in the audience.
Many previous years are followed by Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to them and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro's married then!
Sohlberg was soaking towards Saroko.
The more I think Sohlberg referred to the newly divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, although at first seemed confused.
For the first time in the evening newspaper of the Sanamis, the Siepper spoke of his divorce.
Missikaunotar told me that he did not want to open up the reasons for this distinction in public, because it is a matter between him and Roope Salmis.
He said he wasn't in a hurry for a new relationship, he was going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own stuff, and especially I start living my life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula’s marriage status appeared at a later stage when Sohlberg accidentally called Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula as a wig.
The runner's three laughed at you.
Ioro was married or how did it go?
Janni Huss gave me a receipt.
The Northman tortured his tied-up side by cutting, burning and feeding a strong sauce.
The North Rider Court has condemned the 34-year-old man in Kokkola for three years from the numerous crimes committed by his common partner to prison.
Among other things, crime was a belt, cable, and nipples.
The court condemned these items as lost to the State.
The criminal charges against the suspect were serious rape.
However, this prosecution was rejected.
There were four assaults, gross assaults, coercion, illegal threats, crimes of liberty, serious crimes of liberty, and two damage.
Crimes occurred between 26 March and 24 May.
At the end of the last act, a man was captured and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday, last week, the court of High Court of the North of the North gave its judgment and ordered a 34 - year - old to continue to be held in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34 - year - olds were also accused of two serious crimes of freedom and the gross rape of May 22st.
However, these accusations were rejected as unseen.
The case was dealt with in court behind closed doors.
However, the judgment was published by the Judge-Rapporteur.
According to the Judge General, the accused had committed violence, threats, and coercion to his spouse in situations where he had been bound.
The accused cut his victims with a knife, burned them with tobacco, fed a strong sauce, and poured water and coffee on it.
In his judgment, the court ordered the state to have lost the means of crime: the belt and the cable, the tie, the belt, the knife and the vessel.
Four Witnesses
According to the judgment of the Court of Justice, the parties continued their life together.
The resolution reads that a large part of the most serious acts took place at the end of the criminal period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were consulted in court.
The victim's 34-year-old must pay compensation for pain, suffering, suffering, and temporary harm, for a total amount of EUR 5800.
He hardly has the money, because the convicted already have debts on the inheritance.
The prison sentence isn't the man's first.
The newspaper does not mention the name condemned to protect the victim's privacy.
This is not the case when writing a law-abiding sentence.
Europe, under the leadership of four points in the Ryder Cup solution
On Saturday, European golf professionals imprisoned their leader in a traditional hole game against the United States.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup point 10-6, which will be played at Paris's mildest game, while there will still be twelve double games to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three out of four football games that started on Saturday, and the four games of the afternoon the payouts were equal to two or two.
The leaders of Europe were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches he played on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, none of the European partners had been caught up in this respect.
On Sunday, the twin seeks more history.
No European player has won five points together in Ryder Cup, and no American player has made it like three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns its supporters' brutal harassment in Honka's match: "The power is not part of football"
On Sunday, HJK's football fishing team published a press release condemning the interference of its supporters in the Saturday FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We apologize for events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the communication states.
At the end of the match, some 50 HJK supporters rushed into the field and some seemed to try to challenge Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organisers were not able to calm the situation but needed police and horsemen as well.
HJK reports that the team's players and staff are shocked about what happened.
After the game, the events are not in line with the values of our 111-year-old company.
"We insist strongly on any action that jeopardises the safety of the fight cases", the communication states.
The HRC promises to assist authorities and event organisers in identifying safety threats and removing mild phenomena.
The sponsor culture is part of football and HJK's important business.
In every way we support positive, happy and encouraging activities in football cameras.
"The power is not part of it," the press says.
The Philippines inventor flys with a drone truck - this way to avoid traffic congestion
Mendola is a Philippines inventor, hip-hop dancer, and some kind of Peloton.
He's now part of a growing group of people in the world who swears to have invented a flying car, or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, for example, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendola does not believe in the mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, a man has used a large part of his property to build his dream.
He started developing his car six years ago.
Now he calls the developmental version a drone car.
Recently, he says he did the first successful test flight... he flagged his device at a height of more than seven metres.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope that the device will cause positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendila said it was after the British Daily Mail.
JHL Predicts: Work fighting activities will begin tomorrow in children's day care and in social and health services
In the public and well-being sectors, the bans on working and exchange start tomorrow will be seen, in particular in social and health care services and children's day care, by the President of JHL, Sunivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be wide, and they will certainly be visible in such a way that there are not enough staff present.
Everyone has to think about how to get their children.
It is now up to the employer to ensure that services are played and that no spirit is threatened, says Niemi-Laine to the STT.
According to Niemi-Lame, workers' cancer was also seen at the beginning of the year when JHL members were in an over-work and exchange ban due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through the flexibility, that the staff has not been hired, that workers have been overworked or changed.
This isn't a work fight yet.
In terms of health and safety at work, it is a good standard that regular working hours are taken care of and done only for each worker.
The JHL opposes the Government's intention to reduce the protection of the dismissal of small enterprises.
Markku Jalonen, head of the labour market for municipal workers, does not prejudge the impact of the bans on overtime and exchange.
However, he does not believe that they are very deformable, even though services may deteriorate.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have prepared what can be done.
The area is so vast, social and health care activities and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impact can vary very much by industry, region and employers, Jalonen said to the STT.
Mr Jalonen says that, last week, an experience has already been gained from similar activities of the Association of Close-Seniors and Fundamentals, such as those of the Super and Social and Health Trade Union, which last three days.
Their effects were relatively limited.
The JHL's ban on overtime and exchange applies inter alia to municipal, church, state and private social and health workers.
For example, family day care is restricted.
At this stage, the fight concerns almost 100 000 JHL members.
According to Niemi Laine, JHL's activities may last for a long time.
The Union has also been prepared for other labour struggles if preparations for the Discharge Act continue.
The government should now admit that this is where I run into the wall and hard.
Jalose believes that both the Ay movement and the government must come back.
It's special here that the hard ones are already in the pipe, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalone is updating.
The Great Corallirism is born in the gymnastics of children and adults.
In the other places - the Collateral Great Corallirism received its first night last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kannelház.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Corallirism is a work that is built from the beginning to the end together with the public.
However, this time there will also be a clearer presentation, which will refresh and evaporate the findings of the exercises.
The theatre dress also has a lot of rainy magic for children's participants.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparation of the work.
However, the great Corallirity is not a children's performance, but a presentation that adults and children do in co-operation.
It provides adults with information and observations on the children’s way to receive information and to make art.
The ability of children to throw into practice and joint games also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
The Great Korallirity is a somewhat liketubate, gymnastics, and nature-related information attacks, but it is finally set up in different, non-human conditions around visits.
The Great Corallirity begins with the entry of corals and coral reefs of living organisms and fish.
In six different gymnastics, children learn the lifes of the poor and the sea horse, among others.
Finally, a performance of less than one hour will be made, where music, lights, and shiny paints and costumes will help to get to know the life of the coral reef.
There are both divers in the Great Korallirite who observe the lives of the coral rivet and the corals that are being examined.
In addition, there are coral-exploring organisms.
The looks and observations shown in several directions make the performance a dense and life-giving.
Whether it is a natural landscape, a landscape that looks at it, as well as another organism or landscape that looks at it, and everything at the same time.
It doesn't seem like anything to kids.
In other places, the group is working on the limits of thinking and action to which it is to be caught when it is made up of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more important.
After working hours, Sittor will have a silent demonstration of the threatened corals.
The destruction of man’s understanding over man’s understanding should not be allowed to harden, even though it might be difficult to understand the importance of exercising his own compassion before the prospects of destruction.
In other places, its work has been built in such a way that it respects the diversity of life with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species, and future generations of which it is to be astounded and cut.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad I didn't have smartphones when I was a kid.
Children and young people today are more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking when they are younger and younger.
I think children should be children all the time because of their childhood, and they should not mess up their lives because of drugs and sex, because others say they do that.
I was embarrassed when my friend told me I had to pick up her sister in fifth grade for her "son friend" weekend.
When he came to pick up his drunk sister, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
I couldn't imagine my own sister in the same situation because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that the drugs should not be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today's children will be able to live a decent childhood and that they will not have to grow up because of the group pressure created by fellows too early.
I keep seeing younger and younger girls in Instagram, who are wearing makeup on their face and expose their clothes on their heads.
Snapchat is used to take and send images that reveal the nights.
It's even more difficult to guess what age they are.
Today’s 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood was made up of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't have smart phones when I was a kid.
I had to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what others were thinking of me.
Yle: The authorities have told the government that the Airisto Helmi case is not related to national safety
According to the Ilkka Kanerva surveyed above, the Defence Police and Defence Forces came to inform defence and foreign affairs committees earlier this week.
The Finnish Head of State has been informed that the Airisto Helme investigation is not currently linked to national security, but to organised crime, newsing Yle.
Ilkka Kanerva (Kok) was confirmed by the President of the Defence Committee.
According to Kanerva, the defence forces and defence police took part this week in an ongoing investigation at the Defence and External Affairs Committee.
This is considered to be a primary economic crime.
They were quite strict that no speculating that there would be anything else here, Kanerva commented on Ylen's interview.
According to the above data, there has been no evidence of a link to national safety, but the investigation is only under way.
There's no way of knowing what can be revealed from there, one of Yle's interviewers says.
A week ago, extensive search for home in the island and mainland of Turku has raised the question of whether the investigation concerns purely economic crime or the threat to Finland's internal security.
Earlier this week, the newspaper produced a case that is going through allegations both in favour and against.
Video: The dream painting saved Liverpool's lost series
Liverpool’s 100 percent Valoliiga’s start came to an end, but it was still more satisfied with the team’s 1-1 game at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, the year has passed since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran to the 1-0 guest victory.
Then Pep Guardiola's combination sent the entire Valoliigaiga signal that City was real now.
Everybody remembers how the last season ended.
And I'm sure the Liverpool manager, Jûrgen Klopp, arrived at the same idea as West London.
The Reds had begun with the Valoliiga with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool began stronger, and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to rule alone after his own field end.
Chelsea, in turn, had a nice league guest victory under Wednesday by Anfield Road.
Then Eden Paard rose from the change bench to solve the match with a great individual.
Now, of course, homerd was in on the first few minutes.
In 25 minutes he first played in a small space with the three-tone Mateo Kovacic and Jorge.
Finally, the Croat saw her rushing forward and sent this completely weighted passover.
Homeward went a little down the line of punishment, but he bombed a perfectly left leg on the back corner of the bead.
Half of the Brassard Alison was a little slow in his fight, and he didn't get his finger on the ball.
It must have felt the defeat position to be mildly unfair, as almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger put a goal line for Mo Salah’s direction.
In the second episode, also the Chelsea veskar Kepa was able to get real.
The Basque guard reacted quickly to Sadio Manén's bet and pushed the ball from the top to the corner.
On the other hand, Alison zeroed her throw through the homerd.
The best place for guests came to be 72 minutes after James Milner found his focus on Bobby Firmino.
However, David Luiz, a country forcemate who saved the host’s leadership, was heading toward the statue.
Even after Daniel Sturridge was able to fire at 25 meters, it could no longer last for 89 minutes.
Sturridge played on his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it on the top of an unresponsible bet.
Liverpool's 100 percent overdose ended with a 1-1 game, but it's still in the league with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the championship with two points behind the tip.
At the time of the transmission, the parameters are deep
I remember one decade ago, when a newspaper asked different Finnish players, which divides the Finnish people.
The answer to Jupiter Lisksen was the only thing left to remember: Nen-end.
Some names have n-ends and some don't.
The Jakoline Rivers can be born anywhere, and here was one tray.
In the EU, Finland has made it possible to abandon the annual clock shift.
Very many agree that the shift of clocks twice a year has been a work of fools and has caused many problems.
Finally, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest step in the solution to Finland, although it has not been easy.
The hardest thing now is to decide what time it is to finally end up in: the current summer or winter season, or any other time zone.
This also makes it possible for the people to say their opinion on the sample.fi website.
The interview has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open on Friday 12 October.
The debate is being debated with the coffee table and social media, and everyone has a word to say.
Winter defenders justify their position by the impact of morning light on the well-being of people and on summertime by the influence of nightlight on people's outdoors and thus on the well-being of people.
Both positions have strong supporters and good arguments.
Even research shows that morning light beats people's day and gives them a soft spot.
On the other hand, if not particularly suffering from awakening in the dark, there is more light on the movement of people outside and better gives opportunities, for example, to autumn yards.
The number of additional lights after normal working day has already been calculated for an hour.
I'd love to take both of them, but the bad thing is, we can't do anything in the northeast of the earth.
The winters are too dark and summers for many too bright anyway.
The debate on this issue is that its own view is being driven and the second view is very strongly opposed.
The argument of the counterparty is not exactly listening, since the most important thing is how it feels about itself.
Because almost everyone has an opinion on it, it is somewhat unnecessary to try to turn their other head around.
It's gonna burn out the square.
The subject is very easy to debate, because it does not require a great deal of action and there is enough mutation.
In general, similar matters are more severe and equally infertility.
Well, it's a shame if the wrong option gets elected, but I don't think it's appropriate.
And it always offers a proper scapegoat if life feels like a head.
Joba fought for a visitive victory.
The first guest game in Salibandy Divar produced three serial points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went home from Seinäjoki with a win of 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1).
Nurmo was still in the finish line at the beginning of the third batch, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50.47 the brothers Evetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted for six to five prizes.
Both teams' ices played crucial minutes on a flat-rate basis.
The most effective thing was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was fiery anyway, when Teemu Tuhken (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettun (1+0) also hit.
Michael Kosonen too (1+0) played his goal in the second chain at the time he was born.
Josba has six points after three rounds.
The next one will be the O2-Jyväskylä guest in two weeks' time.
Enon Church Sunday, 200th anniversary
The 200-year anniversary of Eno’s church will be celebrated on Sundays in some very sad atmospheres.
A week ago, the destruction of the danger church was shocking.
Even Eno's church was guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today's still a party place.
Even if no one would like that, Enon Church is now the oldest church of the Joensuu Congregation Society.
The church in the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the municipalities and other associations of the world.
The family fair starts at Eno's church today at 10:00.
After that, we move to the congregation house near the cattle table.
The program has all kinds of things in and out all day long.
For example, you can learn from the guidance of Ari Räsäsinen, who has retired for 37 years.
The church’s birthday also means the end of one era.
Already removed, a church house built in 1982 keeps its doors open for the last time today.
Now we're in the background room at the former municipal building, says the capper Markku Koistinen.
The church house was destroyed by problems with indoor air, but the church has been standing well for the last 200 years.
Elon Musk has been dismissed from the position of the Tesla government leader for 40 million dollars of fraud charges.
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car manufacturer Tesla and CEO of the company, has settled its case with the US Securities Regulatory Authority SEC.
The SEC suspected that Musk had committed a security fraud, and Musk was in danger of being put aside as a result of the company he founded.
However, the Musk can continue as CEO of Tesla.
On the other hand, Musk has to withdraw from the President of Tesla for three years.
The company will have to hire the President of the Foreign Government.
Musk is also subject to more stringent supervision.
According to the agreement, Tesla has to hire two independent directors and monitor more closely Musk's communication.
In addition, Tesla and Musk pay 20 million dollars (approximately EUR 17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market failures and the disadvantages of Tesla shareholders," says Steven Peiki of the SEC.
The case started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding has been secured.
The suite just picked up Tesla's stock exchange rate.
SEC suspected Muskin was guilty of a security fraud.
According to the Agency, the television was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with other management or potential donors of the company.
In practice, the agency accused Muski of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that he would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC stated that she insisted that Musk be sentenced to fines and refused to act under the leadership of the stock companies.
The SEC challenge was stunned by investors, and Tesla's stock went into a strong fall.
More than 800 people died in Indonesia and tsunamis
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and its subsequent tsunamis has risen to at least 832, says the Earth disaster agency according to the AFP.
The number of deaths is believed to be increasing, as there is an ongoing investigation of the damage.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may rise to thousands.
The Friday earthquake brought up a tsunami that attacked the city on the island of Sulawes.
A warning was given immediately after the earthquake, which was, however, quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known dead are from Palus at least until now.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the region of Donggaala located near the centre of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Even now, a number of people are known to be dead.
Iron Aid Requests
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers look for victims.
President Joko Widododo called on the soldiers to continue their rescue efforts without passing through the days and night.
One of the centers of the rescue services is the hotel in Palu, which is believed to be still 50-60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of rescue work, said that one of the ruins of Roa-Roa Hotel, popular by business travelers, was made alive at night.
We also heard people's requests for help, he told us.
Syaug says that we could quickly dig up heavy cleaning equipment in the extremities and tsunamis.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their loved ones in the lost.
Help me, you're in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family is still missing, one writer appealed to the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into alarms' hands in Britain
Many British politicians became subject to harassment when their contact information was leaked out because of the shortcomings in the application's secrecy.
Among other things, the abusers had access to the ministers' telephone numbers.
It was an application used by the British Conservative Party in the Government.
For example, the Minister of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Michael Gove, and former Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson, became victims of harassment.
A number of representatives of the people were in distress.
Due to the lack of confidentiality of the application, the public was able to access the policy profiles that were at the annual meeting of the Conservative Party.
The audience was able to access profiles by using the politicians' email address which was easily available online.
The profile log was used to view and edit the data stored in the profile.
Someone managed to turn Boris Johnson into a profile picture of porn and titled insult.
Michael Goven's profile photo was replaced by a media Mould Rupert Murdoch's photo.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows entry into the profiles of other people with these email addresses.
Then you can view the contact information of the profiler and, for example, send messages in this name.
The meeting application was made public by every supplier, politician and participant in the phone number, Foster criticised.
The conservative reporter asked me to apologize for the data leak.
He said that technical problems have been solved and the application is now safe.
ICO is supported by the British Information Authority.
The application was made by the Australian Crown Comms company.
The working party in the opposition criticises that the conservative party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Finland visit to the public every week has a large number of vulnerable Poles
Watched viewers paid attention to the studio public reactions of the Wall Finland visitation program.
The United States form that was rapidly spread around the world The Wall landed on the Finnish version of Nelos last Saturday.
Heikki Paasose's host game show is described in the same studio in Poland where other international productions of the form are made.
In the Polish studio, the opportunity to describe was exceptional, since space was required in the form of a large 12-metre game wall.
During the start-up period, the social media highlighted the studio audience of the programme, which was considered Polish.
On Twitter, a debate was held on whether the Polish people in the studio might understand anything about the game to be played in Finnish.
The head of Nelos' domestic programmes, Unne Sormunen, will illuminating the evening paper.
He tells us that the studio audience has close players, other Finns, foreigners living in Poland and just Polish viewers.
The audience is made up of international wallpapers in Finnish production, just like the audiences of the “The Wall” series described in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland too, there are such carrots, so-called professional audiences, who visit the different programmes, to state the finger.
He recalls that following the game in itself is not so difficult to understand, even if he does not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to separate.
However, there are interpretations for the foreign language studios that carry out translation work.
There are two interpreters that interpret events at the studio controller as a simultanite seal.
And the studio director then directs the audience and tells us what kind of laptop there is, for example, thrown there, and what's going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff and David had been present in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was involved a few years ago in Talent's Finnish descriptions in Finland.
He always had a simultanite seal in his ear, and he knew everything that was spoken in the descriptions in Finnish, the sum of the Ring.
In the southern part of Japan, the mollusc is moving towards the main island - the authorities warn about land zones and floods.
The authorities also warn against potential land zones and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Tram, but the authorities say that major injuries have not been avoided and that there is so far no information on death victims.
In the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so hard that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK General Radio Company, people have been evacuated into shelters, and electricity has cut off over 300 000 households.
Over a thousand flights have been cancelled, and the pilot trains are in place at a stop because of the storm.
The storm is expected to hit near Osaka during the half day of Finland's time.
The capital of Tokyo is not directly on the path of the storm, but there are also heavy winds and rains.
The train's been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to weather scientists, Trami is tortureing Japan until Monday.
♪ The sky of the hearts is still in my dark ♪
It's been a bad start.
The sky was almost longer when the team disappeared on Saturday at its home for Vasa Sport, reading 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
Carrots now have five consecutive losses and two points for six rounds are in total.
None of the Ace defenders or two lower chain players have yet to score.
The shirts are also growing all the time.
Against the sport, the audience will have a hug at a time when the game was almost half the rest.
Six games are only being played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, we have to be careful, because that's how weak we played.
In particular, the second part of the performance was astoundingly bad, the power of the Ace 1+2 made by Jarno Kärki.
Of course, the victory for sport was good.
The team had a game down from Friday, so it would have been seen in making it.
Maybe it did, but the Ace didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors of the bread day continued to increase
The bread day's mother Pirko Häirinen wonders the audience of the event at the big hall's view.
In some ways, it was thought that maybe not so many people this year would come, Hyvinine will think in the morning.
At the same time as the bread date in autumn 2017 Tractorikynön’s marker competitions were held, so perhaps the expectations would be that the audience could even calculate the previous year.
However, the corridors were already bloated by the ten, the sellers told us that the product was finished, the news was sold more than 500 doses, and the number of cars heard Hyirinen rising.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6,000, and Hyvinen will tell you later this afternoon.
In the morning and afternoon at five hours there was a special amount of programme for families with children, which, I think, attracted them to the record collection.
In addition, Hyirinen estimates that the event will go further.
The sellers also take Liper from a larger area every year.
This year, producers of performers, crafts, pastry and harvest products had arrived at almost one hundred.
The bread day's mother, Pirkko Hyväirinen, inspired the crowd from the hall's view.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In a series of children, the beautiful bread of Teija Kiviniemi won the public vote.
11 different types of bread came to the children’s bread contest.
Marjata Vepsäläinen, the winner of the Ruisler Competition, spent the day in the pie bar of the marches.
7 x most beautiful light - this is how you recognize a good lamp
Wake up the state of life, create the right atmosphere for decoration and read the book without being tired.
It's worth a hundred bucks for good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons to bet on the lighting.
Vinkit gave Innolux a sales and marketing director, Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do a favor to your eyes
The importance of lighting increases, the more years of age are behind it.
A sufficient light can help to cope with problems that many will experience with age when the accuracy of the vision is reduced and more and more suffers from confusion.
Parents also have a growing need for light.
Sixty-six needs light three times as much as 20.
It is therefore worth raining on health reasons for the effects of light and the characteristics of the lamp.
A good light gives you enough light, but no dazzling, Jokiniemi's tip.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior only comes out with the right lighting solutions.
The designer of this moment can afford to choose.
A japandi-style blending of elegance, scandalousness and Japaneseism is provided.
On the other hand, the 70s inspired the modern and playable retrotyl, with its strong colors, metal tones, or ice cream colors, has gone up to boom.
The authenticity is fascinating in the same way as in other decorations of the home.
The materials now appear in wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Showing Your personality
On the other hand, the home is now being put more than before, and it has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, they want their own home to be customized, even a bold lamp with a story to tell.
People are clearly applying for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So we're very design-conscious, says Jokiniemi.
The most recent trendy light in the home is not necessarily purchased, but a timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain ageless, corrugated and elegant classics keep their surface from year to year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you, and good-bye.
KoKoo showed the door to the Canadian worker after three games
The Kokoon and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell's roads are being repressed.
Three league matches without power points were played in the orange patterns, Kokoo says in his announcement.
O'Donnell moved to Koohoo in August with a one-year contract, which included a test period until the end of September.
During the last season, 26-year-old attackers played KHL in the KHL in the Klund Red Star lines and at the KHL farm in KHL in Heilongjiang.
There's no information about O'Donnell's new company yet.
The player wants to set an example in recycling - the goods go to the world in recycling boxes, the plastic changed into paper.
The game’s special business Game Man is currently recycling packaging materials in addition to the games.
Products from stone-legged customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in recycled paper bags.
Products ordered from online trade are packaged, for example, in packages coming from importers.
All the packages that come to us go for re-use.
We may use the boxes ten times, as long as the package is in order to be able to use it, says Ville Purula of Oulu's Pelimieh.
As soft materials, the company uses newspapers and other similar recycling materials as a rule.
The double plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are going to move in the envelope to the recycling material.
The movement wants to set an example for others, too.
According to Purula, recycling is not an extra effort.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
It will also generate economic savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is used again.
The recycling is suitable for the activities of the Game Man, since, alongside the new products, the main product range includes games and equipment used, among other things.
Each fashionful acquisition: One and the same shirt works in every dwelling
Classical clothes work from time to time in the other costume than in the costume.
They create the basis of a good garderobic multi-use, since it is easy to bring together different inhabitants at the expense of high-quality classics.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high quality needles.
This category also includes the black pool.
Black needle made of natural materials on semi-precious stones may not have a mistake.
It can be combined with both straight pants, slippers and jeans, and it can be used to create both a restrained housing and a dirty style.
Half-one is suitable for both a young modern dresser and a classic sophisticated style artist.
This is how you create a style.
The autumn trending box is made of gold brown and wide-coloured blind-sleeves, black-sleeves and grey ankles.
The classic half-one together with the other classics, the blue-haired scepter and the wine-red licenses, makes a womanly and sophisticated housing.
Brings to the black semi-creep by connecting it to the trendy clothing of the straits: jeans skirt, high boots and thick stockings.
Young and stylish!
Russian intelligence services have a long tradition of sabotage
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's external investigation of SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialise in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian-speaking group of diversionno-razvvevíves: the Sabotase and Intelligence Group.
The agents of the USSR's security service in the Western KGB prepared detailed plans for important sabotage destinations, reports the archive manager Vasili Mitrohin (1922-2004).
His data was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil pipelines, and gas pipelines.
In Germany, KGB has acquired uniform forms and accessories for Bundeswehr, railways, hardware guards and certain elements for cover-up operations.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they were dressed in the local Ukrainian police police's nipples, set up inspection stations from the peninsula to Ukraine leading to you and isolated Krim's mother country.
During the Cold War, agents hid supplies of mines, explosives, lighters, and communication equipment for sabotage groups.
In 1998, the KGB’s secret was found in Switzerland, which was blown up by the authorities by waterfalls.
Police reached four rides in the county at night.
The police caught four rides across North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, 18-year-old conthiolahti man blew 1.57 promilles.
He drove two passengers at night at the beginning of Kajaanintie.
On the knees of the lake Kuorevaaraland, the car went off at four nights, and the 19-year-old man in the car, who was only 19 years old, blew up 1.54 prommel according to the police.
He didn't get serious injuries in the drive-out.

The truth story on TV today: The climber was left to die twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on man's own experience.
Tonight's film is based on it.
Everest now gets his first night on the Finnish TV.
In May 1996, the devastating snowstorm surprised the climbers of Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur’s 2015 guide tells about the survival attempt that has been dealt with in cereals.
Tragedia has been made with movies and documents... before.
True events are also being conducted in this case.
22 years ago, the world’s highest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It's exactly Hall that worked as Weathers' guide.
The lives of Weathers could have been saved before they left Nepal for an eye surgery.
As a result of that pressure and air pressure, he lost sight, and therefore the peak conquest had to be cut off.
Rob Hall continued his journey and never came back.
However, the struggle between Weathers and life and death had only begun.
As the storm rose, he was lost and found no more return to the camp.
When a man came to find him, he was found in such bad shape that he was not believed to survive.
Weathers were left to die.
However, as a miracle of trade, he still got on his feet and found others.
The worst-off Weathers thought they were still dying, and once again, he was left behind in his own happiness.
Clearly, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even fellow believers began to believe in the possibility that he was given help.
The movie Beck Weathers plays Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today we've celebrated the 200-year-old Eno Church
Enon's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today.
The Church was married on October 4, 1818, and a family celebration was prepared for the celebration of the celebration year.
The parties began at Eno’s church hall at 10 a.m., after which the cattle’s table was held at Eno’s church house.
The church was full.
517 people attended the family fair.
Enon’s minister, Armi Rautavuori, was glad that people had come to church so much.
It is a great joy for a long time and gives strength to the work, says Rautavuori.
The fire of the Revolutionary Church has touched many, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of Eno’s congregation.
The Enon Church is now the oldest church of the evangelist Lutheran congregations in Joensuu after the destruction of the Church of Kiihäsvaara in a fire.
The agitated tree church was completed in 1770.
In the morning of the exorcism, a Charter was held in which the church that was destroyed in the fire was silenced and remembered.
Pictures and videos: My medical flashed in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
On Saturday, a powerful Hurricane - type crippling storm came from southwest to Greece.
The Mediterranean Hurricane, or Median, is named Zorbaks.
The Greek Aviation Institute has given red weather warning to the regions of Attica, Peloponnesus, Ionian islands, Kyclads and Crete.
The images taken from the region show a great deal of floods around Greece.
The Twitter video shows how between houses in the city of Kiato in the city of Corinth suddenly appeared instead of in the street because of floods.
The second video shows how the car has been driven by flood water.
In the southern part of Peloponnesian peninsula, hard wind caused strong seafaring.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens directs people on Facebook to prepare themselves for the storm in Greece.
The mission calls for the follow-up of weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
The Mediterranean Hurricane, or Median, brings with it heavy rainfalls and even a flood risk.
CNN stated that only once or twice a year, according to a survey published in 2011, medians appear in the whole world, typically in the autumn-October routes, when the temperature of the sea is still high.
The current blow storm left floods in Tunisia and Libya before it continued to travel northward and towards Europe.
In Greece, refugee camps in islands, such as Lesboks, have also been the cause of concern.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to decent protection.
In the summer, the areas destroyed by landtops in Athens are also under the storm.
In Greece, medical medical was also in November.
We don't have to go to the sea right now, but our flights are still on schedule with thousands of Finns on the islands of Greece threatened by the storm.
The trips to the sea are cancelled and even when walking, it is worth taking care not to fly on the storm or other bulk.
These guides have been distributed to just 3 500 Greeks via sun trip to a holiday Finnish weekend.
The instructions come as needed, for even the Zorbas storm, which is in fear, has been predicted to beat the Greek islands this weekend.
In the vicinity of the island of Crete, for example, the wind speed may rise up in the woodwork for up to 45 meters per second.
The greenness of the weather is increasing the heavy rains.
According to tour operators, all persons travelling from Finland to Greece through the Sun and Tui, who have reported their phone number, have been warned of hard winds by SMS.
In the air, the sun and heat
According to the solar travel communication expert Inka Ikosen, on Saturday nights, the worst has been avoided in resorts.
For example, flights have landed and rose according to normal schedule.
Of course, we're watching the situation all the time.
Security ahead.
Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have been on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff on the subject.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me about the early night on Saturday.
There are currently a total of 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular islands in Greece, namely Rodoksa and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on vacation in smaller places.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos will be reached on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rodods had mocked the sun and the temperature fell to 27 degrees, says Iconen of the Sun.
Zorbasen has been estimated to become the next pair of Turkish people, but slightly reduced.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and for example, we have checked the number of Finns flying in Antalya Tuilla, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvisa and Janni Huss have completely identical evening suits in the mischief... so they react to the situation.
The media personality and fitness-cooker Janni Hussi arrived at Miss Finland's final on Saturday in an open-minded evening suit.
Hussi tells me he's got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust professionals who found me a wonderful suit tonight, Hussi smiling.
The exact same silver evening suit had also been chosen by the planner Shirly Karvinen.
The twin himself also noticed similar outfits and reacted to the situation laughing.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanom that he had come in a hurry to prepare, and he had to get on the plane.
The Hussi works as a backstage and red boxer, and she talks about the most important stars coming up.
The Huss has a fresh move behind, because he moved from Kamp to Jőkesaari on Friday.
I'm going to stay there for now. Let's see what happens.
The fact is, there's a private office in the new apartment, Hussi.
Before he moved to Greece, Hussi was alone on vacation.
That was wonderful. I was only at a hotel in a week's time without going anywhere.
When Stress broke out, I got a flu, but otherwise, vacation was really successful, Hussi tells me.
Shirly Karvisen's behavior on the plane attracted a great deal of attention - collected curious views from pensioners
In 2016 Miss Shirly Karvinen and Miss Shirly Karvinen told Miss Finland on a red carpet that she had enough to do with radio trains and Love Island Finnish photos.
The rush has even been sufficient to allow Karvinen to arrive at the finals directly from the Finnair flight.
I made a dress and put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
Night change at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen tells us that he has drawn up his makeup in the midst of pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow travelers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
At least it was fun to make me dress.
The hairy fly to Spain once a week.
He spends about a few days at a time in Marble.
Karvinen tells us that he has enjoyed his laundry as a Finnish plotner for Love Island.
He describes his experience so far as to be stopped.
Karvinen tells me that he's been doing a show on Friday night with the singles.
It's kind of really raw.
They are people's real feelings, Karvinen describes the unique feelings of the program.
How am I gonna put up your knee boots?
Three perfect examples
Classical clothing are garments that work in another costume from time to time than in the costume.
Often classics are decades old, but sometimes even the most modern individuals can be found.
A few years ago, the overcrowd boots in the autumn and winter season have not gone anywhere.
According to their name, the boots above the knee are repeated elegantly from year to year and from season to season.
The visible boots share the opinions of the users, but a bold model is worth testing, no - boldness.
For example, overcrowd boots are actually suitable for any kind of housing.
Well, it's about dick, lace, tying, or trico, the simplest leather or artificial leather of boots works.
Long boots look good in the holidays as well as in the arctic costumes.
The black overcrowd boots are suitable for very weak housing.
They adequately balance the femaleity of a pink, flowery plyeric and hemorrhoid, smooth needles.
It's a fresh, but autumn-style everyday dress for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retrohencous housing comes from a long copper - brown saw, overcrowded boots, visible earrings, and a lace bag.
Even though the overcrowd boots have a certain fineness, they are also perfectly suitable for the renovation of the arcade together with the t-shirt, the long shorts and the trendy box.
It's so easy, and yet it's so elegant!
Two robotic cars start operating in Espoo
They are operating for the rest of the year and taking passengers on board, the City of Espoo reports.
Otaniemi’s robotic cars operate in the role of bus simulators, as next spring in the region is intended to launch traffic on robot buss.
The project develops and pilots all year round robotic vehicle traffic and tests the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
We'll find out how robotic cars can handle the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robotic bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, Transport Manager.
For the first time, robotic cars are fully connected with other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of an auxiliary passenger sitting on the ride.
Vehicles sense their environment on several different sensors all the time and assess whether the vehicle is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether or not an obstacle has been detected to the vehicle, bicycle or, for example, snowboard, says Harri Santamala, CEO of the development of robotic traffic.
The robotic cars travel throughout the autumn three days a week: Tuesday 13-15:30 p.m., Wednesday 10-15 p.m. and Thursday 10-15 p.m.
The robotic cars stop by six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
The stops of the robot cars are identified by the stop markings.
More likely, you can take your ride from the stop at Otakari, number 1.
The Mokoma Group bassist fell off the stage in the middle of the gig and injured
The Mokoma Association will inform you about the surprising situation on its Facebook website on the Tampere Package Room concert.
The Mokoma Group's gig at the Tampere Package Room got a dramatic turn on Saturday, when the band bassist Santtu Hämäläläinen fell from stage to stage during the performance.
It happened when the band was pulling the last song tonight.
The spider's wrist broke.
The band will inform you on its Facebook website.
"We're in the ring!"
Santtu tripped last night in the packing room on stage at the last party and broke his wrist.
Let's hope for a quick recovery for the metal brother!
The rest of the tours are taken care of by backup, and the pages say.
Mokoman fans are concerned about the photo update in which basist-Sattu lies a spark in his hand on the bed.
This news has been expected, it was pretty much a bit of a worry that it was bad.
It's a great relief. Bone's getting better in time.
A quick and quick recovery for Santu and a good tour for the rest of the band plus the tourer!
And thanks for last night, it was a great job, but you promise to leave this strong drama behind?
Police are monitoring hunting in North Karelia and Savo.
The police department in Eastern Finland carried out hunting checks on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Law Center in North Karelia and Upper Savo, police officers told social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the surveillance was on the legality and reliability of hunting.
Each hunter was checked with a hunting card and a warrant for hunting by state countries.
In addition, the inspection of the holding permits for hunting weapons and the permitted quantities of cartridge for channelling weapons were carried out.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the inspection and only one hunter was met during the inspection for which there was no required hunting permit.
The hunter was ordered to fish for 12 days from unauthorised fishing.
In addition, the police blew up 133 vehicle drivers and two of them are suspected of driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in fines, once in a while with the police.
In conclusion, hunters are very well following the promise of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter said that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years, and this was the first time someone's checking the permits."
The police department in Eastern Finland will continue hunting in autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Motten leaves to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of Interior Kai Mkänen (kok.) will travel to Turkey in the coming days to follow the choice of future quota refugees in Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps this year.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, involving representatives of the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already in Turkey for interviews.
The United Nations Refugee Organisation UNHCR first selects vulnerable people.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly intimidating situation in refugee camps, such as single families, disabled people and sick, women and children.
More people are selected for the future Finnish group than there are in the quota, as virtually some of them do not arrive for different reasons.
Motten is also on his way to non-governmental organisations operating at the borders of the Turkish Minister of Interior, Süleyman Soylu and Syria.
Ilkka Salmi, Prime Minister of the Ministry of Interior, is also present.
Talked about raising the quota
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years, the quota was 1 050 a year, but the government had no agreement since to raise it.
The assembly has supported the increase in the quota, but the project has last fallen against the blue.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) recently presented a gradual increase in quota to 1 500 to 2 000 people per year.
In this period, a silent visit will be the first to be made by the Minister for Internal Affairs to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
Former Minister of Interior Petter Orpo (kok.) and Paula Risik (kok.) were able to move to new tasks before the visits were organised.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now we're going to the search... no longer know, cry or laugh.
Last Saturday, the Karjai reported on the bill to change the Act on Animal Protection.
The article took the view that the draft legislation essentially prohibits the keeping of all animals which are not specifically authorised under the regulations of ministries in respect of production animals, pets or other business activities.
In other words, everything else is essentially prohibited except the animals referred to separately in the Regulation.
If the bill goes to law, it would mean that we are rejecting, in Western democracies, the general principle is that the law prohibits, separately, action that endangers the security of society or a good way.
It is now basically a provision for banning all activities to which the law or regulation does not grant a separate authorisation.
This change results in the fact that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business operations and does nothing else until the law or regulation adopted.
The government’s activities in the preparation of law have usually been weak.
If we are now on the road to Finland that, on the basis of origin, everything is prohibited, which is not allowed separately, no longer knows, cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Protection Act would require an update.
But this is not a democratic project.
Unfortunately, I do not feel very well about the Constitution, but it may well accept such a 'all' procedure that is prohibited by law or regulation separately'.
I hope there is a reasonable minister who will stop such a project from moving forward.

Alexia baby, 3 months, sweetly muffled in the arms of Jere
In the Karalahti family photo, attention will be paid at midnight by a sweet three-month baby Alexia.
Nanna Karalahti tells us about the Aito day care set up for Kerava.

Turkey calls for mobile phones to be downloaded in case of storm
The Zorba storm in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, Meteorologists warned in particular seafarers, fishermen and farmers from the storm in Greece, writing CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reported to be moving from south to north in the days of the day.
On Saturday, the disaster and emergency authorities asked citizens to download their mobile phones before the storm and ensure the functioning of the Internet so that people can get current updates, says Anadolu Ajansi, local news office.
People have been urged to stay home and away from windows and to move garden furniture away from the wind for example.
Turkey is expected to have hard rain and wind is expected to blow at 28-33 meters per second.
In Greece, red warning
On Saturday, the Greek air science service provided red weather protection for the regions of Attika, Peloponnesus, Ionian islands, Kyclads and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Greek travel agencies alerted the Finnish Zorba storm in Greece.
The Athens Embassy in Finland also published a storm warning.
Travelers were invited to follow the weather reports and local authorities’ instructions.
A little while ago, when I got in touch, there was a lot of wind and it rained.
People were very calm, the communications chief Laura Aaltonen of the Tui travel agency told the STT on Saturday.
Aaltone described the situation as similar still Saturday night.
By the end of the year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received messages from Finns in distress.
In Greece, in several ports, ships did not operate on Saturday, the local news office Amna told us.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, from the travel agencies to the STT.
According to the Athens Embassy in Finland, temporary disruptions were expected for air and shipping.
Finnair was told on Saturday that the weather is being monitored actively.
Kimi Räikkönen crystalline the reason for Mercedes' better than Ferrari
Ferrar's Kimi Räikkönen admitted that the worst competitor in Mercedes was too hard on Russian gp's time.
However, there is no reason to go down in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver's assessment.
They were just faster than we were, but nothing huge is going on.
Our car was in time for the best weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth driven, and his stable partner Sebastian Vettel said clearly that Räikkönen had missed the Mercedes speed.
Ferrari had a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
They asked where the one-off drop was due to Mercedes' rides.
They seem to be going faster than we are - as simple as that.
If I knew why, we'd probably go as fast as they did.
But I don't know anything more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time, rare treats with respect to Sauber in Räikkönen’s future stable were seen.
Charles Leclerc, who replaces him next season in Ferrari, was the seventh, and the last time ajossion also reached Marcus Ericsson.
The tenth departure point for the Swedish driver is best for more than three years.
And even though five drivers were not fully driven in the second race, the outcome was still tasteful for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging to Räikkös on future thoughts?
Yes, if you compare them to where they were from the early age, the step forward has been great.
Next year, there's a different story, so let's see.
It was there - Robert Helenius knocked Erkan Teperin: "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper's match in Stuttgart's night moved on to a level playing game.
The Germans were the more original party in the ring, but he didn't get a good hit.
Clearly, Helenius controls the match with his hard series, who found it well.
The Finnish was also clearly in a better physical condition than Teper.
Finally, the solution came in the eighth column when Helenius swept the Teper on the left.
It was so hard that a con man in front of his home audience didn't even try to get up from the carpet.
After confirmation of victory, Helenius was very moderately windy.
During his interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere and his opponent created by the public.
And then for a moment, he changed into a Finnish.
Thank you to all the viewers and Finnish inducers.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius was happy right after the fight.
It was a very big victory for Helena's career.
It might be possible to get even into the World Cup, Helenius commenting on the Night magazine before the fight.
Instead, the kill could have decided the whole boxing career.
Of course it's been in mind.
There won't be any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper scene.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster can be multiplied
According to The Guardian magazine, the Vice President of the country is calling for a clear increase in the victim's number.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims can rise to thousands.
Severe circumstances
The Saviors are looking for the remaining ones, as well as the dead from the worst affected areas on the island of Sulawes: I am asking the port city and its neighboring Donggala.
To date, all victims are in Palu, the situation in Dongga is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are lost and about 540 have been hurt badly.
There are still people in the sorting buildings that rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, Roa Roa Hotel in Palu has failed.
Saviors say that they have heard the screams of those who have been trapped in the ruins, but the lack of a defrost has delayed the beginning of the rescue.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widododo, has assigned an army to rescue and wi-fi.
There is a need for the military and its equipment, as electricity and telecommunications links in the disaster zone are in many places.
The fuel reserves are on the way too.
Miss Finland's unaccustomed response and long reflection caused laughter.
The Billnäs Ruuk is currently choosing a new Miss Finland.
In the interview round, a question was asked to every mischiefist.
The finalists pulled the question of the glass bowl on the stage.
Especially finalized the number of six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, the unpleasant response received during the public presence at the time of sweet, but good-looking laughters.
The question raised to the Anttikos had been coming through Facebook.
The user, Pirko-Ella, wanted to know what is the latest book that the misfit has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer to a good one before he began to hesitate.
Thank you for the question, Pirko-Ela.
The last book I've read... Anttikoski said thinking.
In the public, the time was given by laughter until Anttikoski continued his response:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I've read is someone in economics, Anttikoski answered.
After his reply, Anttikoski received fresh applause from the audience with a laugh.
Earlier in the missionary tour, Anttikoski attracted attention, for he did not want to hang in underwear because of his principle.
In 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 21.00, when the crown is abandoned last year by Miss Suomi Michaela Söderholm.
The sike omena pear cake takes the tongue by the end of the day
This recipe is for you who have good, acid apples behind your own, because the domestic apple is at the store at shocking prices.
Maybe we have to buy a pear, though I think it's time for a lot of people to grow that pear tree.
This cake can only be made out of apples if the pear does not want to buy.
The taste, of course, is more diverse if the cake rains its pear too.
The peel of apples and pear and remove the seeds.
A slice.
You can close it in the ceiling.
Take the eggs and sugar into the foam, then add the corn flour to the foam and melt the butter.
Combine maize starch, whether or not sweet and bread powder, and add to butter.
Add sweets and wheat flour, mix well.
Wheat breadberg with breadpaper, stretch two cane sugars to the bottom of the goat and spread pear slices on sugar.
Locked half of the magic over the pear slices and the apple blocks over the magic.
The end of the lock is a magic spell over the apple blocks.
In the oven at 180 degrees about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Just let it cool in the bed and then cancel it for the waiters.
Just cut the cake really cool.
The cake is brittle in structure and it's much more noticeable because of the fact that there are mantle and corn flours that do not have gluteens.
An international crime literature event will be held in Ruka in January
Kuusamo Ruka will be held in January for the first time in an international literature festival focusing on Nordic crime literature.

The star Jens Lapidus and Erik Axel Sund are seen as a literary visit to Festival.
Besides the Swedish names, visitors are also seen from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
The Finnish writers are represented by Max Seeck.
According to festival organisers, the northern location, nature, dark season and Kuusamo's unique environment provide a framework for unique written experience.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts of popularity
What makes a person a popular, charismatic, or admirable?
Researchers at Sydney University have outlined two types of "coolidality", which consisted of a small number of different features: generally attractive coolness and, in that respect, the opposite convent-coliency.
According to the researchers’ description, the cool people had many socially wanted features: they were outward, friendly, friendly and qualified.
For the dissidents, there was a typical distance, independence, rebellion, and grass.
They were thirsty for experiences, and they were just a little bit concerned with external assessments.
Both types combined good self-esteem and stable emotional life.
The role of hardness on is no longer cool: a high status in teen age may not lead to success later in life.
This is how the US study published in 2014 in the Child Development magazine.
Young people who were dating early had a growing risk of using drugs and thinking about crimes when they were young.
In their relationships, they were less capable than ever of having unnoticed mates.
The high-synthetic lock trucks, brand boxes or bells that send a high-level status don't make people cool or, at least, genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in the Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the majority of people were more ready to make friends with their normal stamp shirt than with those wearing their shirts, despite the fact that most of them chose a brand shirt when they were introduced.
If you're on the Greek holiday island, watch out!
It's hitting a storm, the weather warning's screaming red.
During the weekend, in southern Greece, rain can be as much water as in Finland on average over six months.
The storm of Zorbas will strike Greece during the weekend.
Take precautions if you are in Peloponnesus, Ionian islands, Kyclats, or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens reports it on its Facebook website.
According to the embassy, the Greek air science service has given regions a red weather warning.
The approaching storm is also reported as the weather service in Forecan's blog.
According to it, the worst trees in the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
As a result of the comparison, from the beginning of the week Finland was beaten by the Assma storm, it was most difficult to blow a fair 31 meters per second.
According to Blog, however, the biggest concern of the Zorbas storm is not wind, but heavy rains.
A weekend in southern Greece may have more than 300 millimetres of water.
It accounts for about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
The Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has shared the video of the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused floods in Tunisia and Libya this week.

Plays with confusing Youtube videos
Few people know that the beautiful Anku, dead by several men in Love Island Finland, is also present on strange videos of Youtube published in 2010.
With video, Anku advises accursors, amongst other things, to prepare the blackberry from an old economic paper roll.
Anku also shows his sympathetic style as to how the stockings can be with an askarre, with the right peaks growing.
Now let's make Easter meals grow, but let's do it a little surprisingly, Anku's hinting and presenting sawdust, stockings, and wheat seeds from which he makes the silk.
You can watch videos from the Underground or Anku Youtube Channel from here.
Sergeant Battas was shaking and biting out the adrenaline in Sotsh. Is he going to be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Officer Bottis was shaking a little more tens of minutes after Russia's gp pick-up drive when he was in front of the media.
The great tour left the first star of Mercedes Lewis Hamilton and was certainly of spiritual importance for the Finnish time gathered this season.
Nice round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the solution round.
I feel good, I'm still shaking, Bottas figured it out.
I've only been on the stake once this year in Austria (in the middle), so time has gone quite the way.
This track has been good for me before, and I've got good rounds again.
It is not easy to miss the Soth track, so the departure is in a particularly large role.
And of course, Bottas was able to answer the question of whether he's going tomorrow for victory, or whether he's going to the MM title for the coming Hamilton Jeesing.
My starting point for the race is definitely trying to win.
When he left the stake, there can be no other goal, Bottas baalt.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis's lead on Sebastian Vettet is pretty big and the difference between me and I'm very big, so you have to keep it in mind.
Well, let's see what's going on, but Bottas is complete.
After the drive, Hamilton was truly happy about Bottak's success, and the Mercedee's stable boxer Toto Wolff had a taste.
Lewis had a plan to win the Valter, but he couldn't make it in the lockout.
The warden knows he's gonna have to tear everything out of himself to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline broke out of his ears, Wolff glowed.
The question is whether the stable will allow Bottak and Hamilton to drive responsibly, Wolff replied.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kitekeinen Erno Kinnunen reached the Finnish championship of the Rally
The SG series ended on rare occasions.
Barely before, brothers have become Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done in a final rallium driven by Turku and Salo, the Tusalians Eerik and Henrik Peternen, because Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
Erno Kinnunen, Kiteelainen, made sure that his career was best achieved when the third place of the final race was sealed for him in the two-wheel drive SM4 class of the Finnish championship.
In Honda Civic, Kinnunen, a competitionist and a manor reader, Ville Mäkelä, started the Turku competition at the expense of the competition, since the starting points were clear: the investment in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the dark of Friday night, the twin had to give a level when some of the extra lights failed another special test.
It's got to be a little shocked by the third short.
In a situation like this, it doesn't fit in.
On Saturday only a second watch was held at the speed of the Jussi Tepo in the series, Kinnunen told us.
Syria requires the United States, France and Turkey to take out their troops
The Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
At the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallam said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and he said that the war against terrorists is almost over.
In his UN speech Muallam also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
But there is no end to the seven years of war.
More than 360 000 people have died in the war.
The Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday in Germany that in October, a Syrian meeting would be planned to take part in his addition to the French, Russian and Turkish presidents.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court Judgeship on TV
The Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasay Ford, who was accused of being persecuted, received an exceptionally large number of people on the screens.
In the United States, the appointment drama of the Supreme Court Judge was at least 20 million people on Thursday night.
At that time, Donald Trump appointed Kavanaugh and Professor Blasay Ford, who was accused of being persecuted, were in front of the Senate Court Committee, telling his story.
According to the preliminary findings, six main channels, ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC followed the consultations with a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to their online consultation, millions more followed.
NBC reported that there were 6.8 million people following livesm and CNN reported that they had done their annual record with 8.2 million live broadcasts.
CNN's figure will rise to over 10 million when you count your transmission through Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital was also able to launch 8.0 million.
Digital launches are channel, TV viewers are from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final readings on Monday, but they are, in any case, a feat.
It's rare to reach 20 million.
More than 20 million viewers in the United States usually have sports matches and large Oscars and Grammy galas in the entertainment world, as well as random political events such as Presidents' speeches and presidential protests in 2016.
There is, of course, a trip to Super Bowl, the most annual American football league in the US.
This year, Super Bowl gathered around 103 million people on the NBC channel.
According to Nielsen, last year Trump's first speech to Congress, there were about 48 million people and 30 million people who were in office.
That's a great thing.
The Supreme Court’s term of office is an extremely important case in the United States, as the posts are life-long.
Trump was already able to appoint a new judge when Antonin Scali passed away from early 2016 and the Republicans managed to stop President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced this year that he would retire.
Kennedy was appointed as the Republican President, Ronald Reagan, but he was in a number of questions in the so-called ‘synthetic’ language, which the vote might have resolved the judgment of the Court of Justice.
He was a promoter of abortion law and sexual minorities' rights and, for example, resolved in 2015 with a voice that same sexes had acquired marriage law throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative than his cans.
His choice of Supreme Court may be to lock the law over the decades of conservative sovereignty.
Children have the right to receive information to parents
Parents of children under 10 years of age only see the health information of their children from Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's strange.
The situation of the Kanta service, of course, was even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health information or recipes of the small-sized people.
This situation was temporarily characterised by a correction in autumn 2016 for persons under 10 years of age.
Since then, the practice has been promised to be corrected, but it has been amazing for a long time.
Now the repair is under promise - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than an auction.
After that, the painting understanding is about the button printing: when the Bible is closed, it will be opened.
Of course, a child can show his information to his parents if he has bank IDs or an official ID card.
But how many ten-year-olds do you have?
The personal ID card is paid, and ten-year-olds are not even available.
Therefore, in practice, information from the undergraduate fourth grade cannot be seen unless requested as printed.
It's not as much about parents' rights as about children's rights.
It is extremely important that parents can be involved in the treatment of children.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
Even minors can have family situations where not all things can be freely spoken.
They are often related to sexual health, where free care is deeply relevant to human rights.
In the United States, the FBI has begun to fuck up the charges of harassment against Kavanaugh.
According to the U.S. press, the FBI will investigate at least two of the female harassment charges.
One of the women was heard earlier this week by the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs.
Kavanaugh has challenged the accusations of alleged sexual harassment during his study days.
President of the United States Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The investigation shall not take more than one week.
Washington Post says it's a criminal investigation of a more limited investigation, and it doesn't necessarily become public.
He threatened to kill cops at the police station in Kajaan.
The attached detonator continued to pullicate even on the chamber.
The police say they put a man in a police prison to "cuff him."
The police were threatened by a suspected assaulter on Saturday night in Kajaan.
The authorities report a case that started when a fair 30-year-old man challenged a brutal dispute at the central restaurant.
The man was first assaulted by another client inside the nutrition store.
This led to the removal of the restaurant.
On the outside, a fighter attacked another man by pouring him into the ground.
When the third party tried to do it, the man hit him too.
Contraception led to a call from the police.
The squad caught him and took Kajaan to the police station, and the police say.
The suspect was still aggressive at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
The police say they've sent a man to a police prisoner "to make a deal".
A man is suspected of three abuses and a violent opposition to an official.
Aid organisations are preparing to start work at the Indonesian Sulawes - "The water is the most urgent one"
The UN Children's Organization Unicef and other international aid organisations are ready to help the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, says Kirsi Haru, Finnish Head of Information of Unicef.
Local authorities are leading rescue efforts, but the need for further assistance is obvious at this stage.
Unicef works in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
Besides normal operation, Unicef always has full emergency preparedness, says Haru.
The first task is now to find people in ruins, both survivors and dead.
Please, in the city of Sulawes, rescue measures are under way, but in the region of Donggala, the situation is a little clearer.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Aid is difficult, because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
The buildings are often light structures in Sulawes, so the damage caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need protection first, for example, tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
For the first time, people are most likely to be able to provide water-cleaning tablets, which are also stored in Unicef.
Water systems are designed to be corrected as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is transported at first sight, for example, by trucks.
In times of crisis, many children get rid of their parents.
The search for family members and the pooling of families are part of the Unicef mission.
The World Food Programme (WFP) is the World Food Programme, among other things, providing food assistance.
In the initial phase, the funds previously collected will be used for emergency aid.
Among other things, Unicef has already started a money collection to help the victims of Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami.
Billion Elon Musk, president of Tesla's government, will close the fines of $20 million in Twiite.
Elon Musk, founder of space rockets and electric cars, avoid fraud charges with the US Securities Commission.
Billion Elon Musk will cease his mission as chairman of Tesla's board of electric cars and will agree to a fine of $20 million.
Musk claims to be part of the task of a contract which he concluded with the US Securities Market Supervisory Authority.
Completing Musk to avoid fraud charges.
The U.S. Securities Commission, SEC, threatened Muski for security fraud in August due to the receipts he sent.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing the electric car company to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange, which brought the company’s stock exchange to a rapid increase.
According to the agreement, Musk must not be chaired by the Tesla Government for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new 'dependent member' to its government and take two 'independent leaders' of its management.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor the communication of Muskin.
Musk is still allowed to continue as CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Muskin's personal 20 million fines, the Tesla company also has to pay 20 million equivalent fines to the financial supervisor.
The Twiits led investors wrong.
According to the SEC, Musk's Twiits led investors and Tesla shareholders to be misled.
Musk claimed that he would have ensured the financing that Tesla would buy back from the stock exchange into a private limited company.
According to the billions of receipts, the company would have been bought out of the stock exchange for $420.
The stock exchange rate of Tesla rose by more than 10 per cent per day after the receipts, but decreased later.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims did not have any basis.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the financing he claimed.
Nor did he discuss the withdrawal from the stock exchange with any other board or company board.
On Friday this week, the course fell by 14 per cent when SEC reported fraud.
The new agreement is expected to reinvent the company's course.
The last sentence is not a reason
Of course, the bells of judgment do not sound when the wise men do not move.
It's a technical flaw.
The tower clock of the Helsinki Court of Judgment has stopped.
The knives show at 12:00.
It's like the middle-time horror scene: even though the church's crypts were a manna and the guerrillas would go to themselves.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for technical reasons: it has been broken.
It's been seen by a repairer, but some of it's broken and it's expected to be a new part, so suunto Eveliina Jamsen tells.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned by the Twitter account in Kirko Helsinki.
In fact, it is mentioned that the final judgment is not a reason for stopping the clock.
Jamsen says the church bells don't ring because of the fault.
