The victory of right-wing populace in Austria, with a total of 29%
The decline in the two parties to the large coalition so far has been felt, and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties has been made according to the first preliminary results, according to the future parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the current president, Wilhelm Moltererer, was seriously hit, has suffered particularly severe losses.
On the other hand, the President of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Karinia Province, Jörg Haider, is preparing to return to national politics.
On the basis of the preliminary results, the country's strongest party to the Socialist Democratic Party (SPÖ) will remain 29.8% of the votes, but it lost 5.5% of the votes compared to the last 2006 elections.
The ÖVP was even worse, which loses nearly nine percent of the votes by 25.6%.
These are the worst results achieved by both great parties in the post-war history of Austria and, in particular, by the People's Party, the result is catalyst.
At the beginning of July, on leaving the ÖVP coalition, the people's party had a significant advantage before SPÖ according to the public opinion polls.
However, the electors were clearly punished for letting the government fail.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations have been made on the possible termination of the parties and the present beginner.
The observers believe that this can be done at the extraordinary plenary session on Monday.
This development would probably make it easier to get out of the election result, i.e. to renew the big coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) had reached 18 percent of votes in advance and the BZÖ obtained eleven percent of votes - but the Social Democrats, at the same time, expressed their fear of repeating the 1999 year, when the people had agreed with the populists (the FPÖ was still united at that time, they had turned away from the BZÖ in 2005), which even led to sanctions on behalf of the European Union.
Hadier, who has already said that he was willing to cooperate with any party, and I assume that he can return to Vienna in national politics, is obviously the solution.
The Green Party was also in Parliament, which, however, fell back from its somewhat lost popularity, and between the Austrian political parties, fell back from third place to fifth.
None of the other parties crossed the limit of four hundred and did not enter the Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations can cool
If we fail to solve the problems of Czech scientists who have been reported for the illegal collection of bugs, Karel Schwarzenberg, Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that there might be some fragility in Czech-India relations.
This is what the minister published in New York after his meeting with Pranab Mukhherji, his partner in India today.
"If this were not to be resolved, yes, there would be a certain lapse," she found after the meeting, which was inspired by Czechism.
Mukhherji, after the trial, said that enforcement power could be difficult to intervene in court cases.
However, he pointed out that in the case of Petr Švacha, dismissed and punished from charges, the central government may negotiate with the local leadership of Darjeeling, whose law is the subject of the case.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
According to Mukherji, it would be best for Emil Kučera to appeal to the Supreme Court for three years.
Then you could apply for bail and wait for judgment, explain.
Schwarzenberg has demonstrated that his partner has expressed himself in a similar way during the trial.
"He offered an appeal to the Supreme Court, so it would be possible to rescue him," said the Czech diplomat's boss.
The only way to intervene in the whole case is by the Czech party, to provide the defendant with "compensated legal aid", the Indian minister mentioned.
At the same time, he told me that the Indian party already gave them such help.
"Our main interest in maintaining the best relations with India with many years of history.
This is acknowledged by the Indians," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told the TSI, his partner stressed that the Czech Republic was of great importance to the problem of Czech Enemologists.
"We find it a serious mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
For the question of whether the Indian party has been promised to deal with the case, the Minister has missed the answer.
"I've already had a lot of promises," she noted.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed
It enters the wall electronic map on which Australia and neighbouring sea areas are visible.
However, he does not care about the continent, but is an excellent point in the blues of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and the surrounding seabed.
During the area as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosso, who belongs to the thirty-member working group on UN divisional and maritime law issues.
Chief Mikulka, Czech lawyer, head of Division, monitors the explanation, which sometimes complements.
It's a workout and enthusiasm that prevails here.
The seabed has a rich, barely known world in natural resources.
Oil, ore and other mineral substances can be found here, but also living organisms that are not yet known, such as cancer, may be the key to the development of a drug.
Seabeds other than dry land
Coastal states are currently in intensively applying for new sub-sea areas.
According to the United Nations Convention, their rights have been exercised, which was agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
First of all, we are talking about the area of the so-called continental base, which is often about a few hundred kilometres from the coasts of that country.
Such a country shall have exclusive rights under the Convention to all sources of the mandate.
"Simplified, we hold the part and the bottom layer of the continental base, which is the natural continuation of the underground continent.
It goes beyond the coasts of the coastal sea, often 200 miles [2100 km], but only across the borders of the economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country to the Committee setting out the external borders of the Continents shall be accompanied by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of cost-effective research and measurement.
This is the result of many annual preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is legal and technical assistance to the Committee.
The Committee has so far negotiated five applications, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three countries mentioned have succeeded," says Mikulka.
The success of Australia in the world has recently led to a echo, which has first significantly expanded its underground country.
But New Zealand also won - the area of seabed, which the Committee considers, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is six times larger in the country.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits resulting from the future use of the seabed will be inestimable according to their hopes.
Other countries are continuing to submit applications.
They can do so within ten years of the date of ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
The area of the ocean floor declared by the Convention as "the common heritage of humanity" will begin where the mandate will be terminated.
There's no one here who has an exclusive situation.
The right of production in this area shall be granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The bottom of the sea, however, is not Klondike," says overrun Director Mikulka, saying that "the same areas are legally clearly surrounded and the regime is laid down in a contract".
Czech Republic on the Pacific Ocean
Some of the seabeds now belong to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries in this former Eastern bloc within the framework of the Joint "Interceanmet" organisation.
In 1991, like investors from some other countries, this organisation received the status of the so-called "responsible investor" status under the Convention.
He was entitled to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean.
The area examined by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom of the sea is a copy of the Tatra under the sea.
"This can be produced in a total of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich location of nickel, rheze, cobalt and manganese polymethical coin," refers to another lawyer, the Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a member of the division Macedón, is presenting another example of concrecia.
He reminds me of a parchment with a potato or a little fantasy on the parchment with the magic words Golemet.
Some special forces were present at hostage liberation
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help to resolve the hostage - and experts came.
When the situation became operational, the special units were ready, but their deployment did not take place.
There are more and more details about the release of eleven European tourists taken in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, special German forces were involved in the rescue operation.
In addition to the German Federal Army experts, GSG 9, the German Federal Police Airport, and the Federal Criminal Office’s staff, as well as the logistics experts of the German Technical Service, were at the scene of the release.
However, according to the news of the ministers on Monday evenings, the German forces were not required, as hostages let their prisoners run and then fled when they recognized the signs of violent hostages.
The Egyptian Government accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as a support force on the ground.
"It was not luckful," said the spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of Home Affairs.
The attackers kidnapped a group of tourists from five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts in Egypt on 19 September in the southern part of Egypt.
Following the kidnapping in the desert territory of South Egypt, hostages were dragged into the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The presence of hostages has remained unsolved until now, as are details of the release of hostages or possible ransom payments.
The escaped people arrived safely in Cairo in the meantime.
Steinmeier said that the released hostages are under protection of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, they did not provide any information on when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five tourists and special forces arrive in Germany on Tuesdays on the German Air Force Airbus.
The U.S. Council rejects the rescue package.
The U.S. Congress has failed a $700 billion rescue package proposed for the financial markets by a small majority.
Dow Jones fell deep.
The US Representative's House 227 did not vote 206 in favour of the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite the calls made by President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both parties, the programme was not intended to contain chaos on the financial markets.
Supporters were desperately tempted to convince critics of the need for a $700 billion package in a dramatic action.
Barney Frank called on Members to support one of the party's negotiating leaders, even if the plan is very unpopular.
"Nezez's political support to avoid something that hasn't even come to pass" has been recognised.
Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent during the vote and fell 600 points.
The investors were concerned that the state rescue package could fail.
The index rose briefly before the vote was completed, and then it fell again after failure was made public.
Experts are counting on additional serious market developments in international financial markets.
To the entry into force of the programme, both the Assembly and the Senate are required to approve it.
The directors are recording more and more reservations.
It's a good winter promise for German travel operators.
According to a study, the traffic of the next months' travels increased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 per cent for the winter season.
Despite the weak conjunctural prospects, the Germans did not choose to travel according to the study.
In the winter season reservations, travel agencies recorded 31 percent increase compared to the previous year - on Monday, Berlin, Germany’s Travel Association (DRV).
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of reservations for autumn months is higher.
The traffic of travel agencies in October was 11 per cent higher than in October 2007, and DRV reported.
These results are based on GfK data, which assesses the monthly bookings of 1200 German travel agents and then extrapolates the entire market.
The Institute took into account the travels booked by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar price, particularly travel to the US, DDR reported.
Here, the size of the reservations increased by one third in the round.
In addition, the Germans' particularly popular destinations are Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic landscapes.
Mostly the organized roads were looking for, said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
Due to rising energy and food costs, the costs of organised roads can be estimated "at the right time for passengers as well as for individually organised journeys".
Passengers, among other things, can save money with booking discounts or all inclusive offers - added Laepple.
The summer months' booking rate was also very good, so again, compared to the previous year, it will be possible to record traffic growth - although another study shows that less German tourists than the previous year have been travelling.
My first Oktober painting
Prominents of Ballermann Slavs, literal harlots and fashionable dirndlits, repeated without a break.
Debut on Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I are not really much like each other.
He's a blonde, TV programmer, and he's wearing a size-defined dirnd.
My hair's dark, I'm a student girl, and I bought my clothes in the van.
One thing, however, connects us: We've been in Wiesnen for almost three minutes, we've already been rushed by photographers and filled with their memory cards - very flattering, and this is all on my first visit to Wiesnen.
That's how we can make friends.
Looks like the cheap dirndli will do its job.
As a Wiesn tourist on the north of the white sausage, my comfort zone is still limited.
But when you arrive at Theresienwies, it's not that bad anymore.
Almost everyone wears drendel or leather jackets; no one looks gloomy or awkward - everything's fine.
It's a strange look at my chocolate banana stand. It's just my lord's tie.
A woman in Munich calls my attention to the misconception of a tie: "You're free bound to be, you're a virgin in the middle, you're gone right, you're widow in the back."
I secretly tied the mask to the left from behind.
"That's good," you say and laugh.
Others make less sense around fine flirts and wear a simple filter base with "I'm too drunk to dress up" sign, and they don't hesitate to show their naked butts.
The young man who displayed exhibitionist traits is called Bob, and he also visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
What you find very fantastic is stretching the "aaaaaaaaaaaa" long.
He tells me all of this after he got rid of the contents of his past drink.
Right next to one of the firefighters everyone sees as a garbage dumpster.
So Bob's one of the famous "tunners".
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Eight o'clock at night, the ambulances go through the scene and take care of the poor couple.
Patient nurses always appear on a team - four at the same time carry a bed covered from tent to tent.
This works as for most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, leaving is double-blocked.
You can't see who's lying in the liquor company under the pony.
"These are the ones who are fully ready" - called me one of the sanitizers for my question and then in the revolution.
Police have named the victim of the accident
The police named the 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
There was an accident on Shenfield Road in the city on Friday afternoon with the resident from Chelsea Road, Carole Paulson.
She was taken to a hospital called Queen's Hospital in Romania, but later she died.
After the accident, an 51-year-old was arrested under suspicion of reckless driving.
He's been released for bail since then.
Turkey's supporting diplomatic horizon
Quite before Turkey was determined to join the European Union, European powers had been burned by the desire to enter Turkey deeply into the background.
On the eastern side of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, consists of one of the greatest relics of the failed empire.
The Hydepasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what travel books write.
The building is surrounded by the end of the perons, a tower around each front corner, and it looks like some kind of German rural town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little full.
However, it is clear from the inside of the store's ticket office what a large-scale enterprise had the western front gate.
The station was opened by the German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the 'until the future of the conquests', through this Damascus Baghdad, intended to achieve its ambitions to book the Middle East through today's railway to Saudi Arabia.
The German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
His railway lines were attacked by Arab Lawrence and Arab partisans.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The British colonial army is out of Egypt, and it squeezed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The Hyderpasha station wasn't even better.
In 1917, an ammo train blew up and destroyed the building's well-developed top.
According to Turkish sources, there was a sabotage operation.
It's been a long time since, and history's overrun.
At the same time today, as the gate to Anastasia and the entire Eastern region - at least in symbolic terms - is served as a diplomatic horizon for Turkey.
The Party of Justice and Development in the government - the ACP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
A new policy is marked by commitment.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government is working on good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Hamas and Fatah Palestinian groups, with Iraq, Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I took up to the Turkish capital, Ankara's night train to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish parliamentary representative, Suat Kinikolt.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of mutilation, which at that time gave me the famous documentary on the old world, the rhythm of the "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is intended for the symbol of the new world state, which turns its back on the past.
However, an AKP paradigma with well-known Islamic roots represents a change in the Turkish consensus.
This has made some suspicions in the west, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP Cathedral, an ultra-modern, stone and steel building, specifically designed for this purpose, which is located in a developing suburbs district, in a semi-prepared shopping area and coffee houses.
Suat Kinicloglu would have joined a better-centred politician in any other European country.
She was killed, wearing a tie, and I'm sure she had another Blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is to help Turkey re-integrate into its immediate environment.
The Cold War has broken the order," he said.
Turkey is isolated from its country of origin.
He had to turn east and west at the same time today.
He couldn't choose between two.
He had to open both directions.
"But is it possible that you might be forced to choose sooner or later?" I asked.
"Treaty never wanted to come forward."
He then stressed what almost everyone I have spoken to here, and then almost repeated mechanically: Turkey, not only in the Middle East, but also in its relations with the Caucasus and the Black Sea, will benefit Europe and the United States as well as Turkey itself.
It is as if the message were to be transmitted - in a transparent way - with Turkey as a whole, all Europe can get to Asia and the Middle East on those eastern railway lines.
When I was back at the Hydepasha station, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura after another night, the two German gentlemen who saw the reconstruction of this beautiful building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have wondered if they found out that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as soon as I waited at the port for the ferry to take me back to Bosporusso, I remembered that at that time Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
At the time, it was not at least questionable which part of the land would need this exciting country.
Remembering Lifeways: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, as the music director of Guildford, Vernon "Tod" Handley ( negrologg, sept. 11) led Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus.
According to the music plans for the part of the city, he established his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
In fact, only under 21 years of age could have belonged to the singing arm, but when Proteus sang his song in 1979, many of us were already at the end of our 20s, we simply refused to deal with the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mitological transformer) was consistent with the determination and ability of the choir to cope with any kind of dots they present - be the Madrigal or a part of the Messiah; without escort or with the help of the great orchestra.
The diversity of music in such a young chorus was often amazing and always exciting, and we were due to the man whose inspiration for music has remained unchanged over the years.
How often Tod told us to "let's let the music speak by itself."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
Everything's in the bag.
So sing it."
The conductor's technique was always perfectly understandable and accurate, but never diametrical or extremist.
Whatever the music standard was, he'd always raise it.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If he's ever lived as a commanding officer who was supposed to be a knight, that was Vernon Handley.
I was well acquainted with the two decades during which he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
I've written criticism of over 100 concerts in the past 40 years, but never one of them has disappointed me, and often he's agitated me.
Tod Handley was together with the size and modesty, which is very rare.
He hated those bracelets who, living with his words, simply "a well-known battle of battles all over the world."
Many of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett says:
According to your necrologue of William Woodruff (September 25), he continued his economic history studies in Oxford in 1964 and became an scholarship to Houblon-Norman's research institute in 1950... while his initial diploma, master's diploma and PhD's title were constantly drawn up."
This is from the author's notes of Woodruff's work "Beyond Nab End", but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, the economic history of the Nottingham University, and in the meantime under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers, he completed his Ph.D. demonstration on the British rubber industry, which was then issued in 1958 by the British rubber industry.
In 1950-51, he was indeed in the United States with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities in Iinois, New York and Harvard.
He finally left Nottingham and moved to Bellinois in 1953.
It can't be known why Woodruff decorated his career this time.
J.Vente Resino on the Boar
"J. Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life" exhibition is recommended because the photographs of black and white documentary style are impressive.
The simplicity and strength that cost them, as well as respect for the people in the photographs, have drawn my attention to them.
This exhibition is carried over by emotions.
Resino's been able to inherit the magical moments."
Second sales record at Honda
In November Honda starts marketing second-generation Jazz.
It is true that his predecessor was already quite a big one, but the development of a new model in the internal field is even more spacious.
All this is combined with sophisticated mechanics, which makes driving more comfortable and increases fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolation.
That's how the second generation Honda Jazz looks.
Although it is very similar to that of the new Jazz, many internal changes have been made.
These include, for example, innovative design, new bodywork, larger sizes and new mechanics.
But before we switch to a detailed description of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz has appeared six years after the first generation was placed on the market.
So first, we can conclude that Honda has been able to renew this model in a shorter time than other producers.
In Europe, Jazz is less known, but sales records are decided on other markets.
Such a market, for example, is Japan, where Jazz was the most sought car brand in 2002 and then in 2008.
In Japan, for example, nearly a million copies of Jazz have been sold since they were placed on the market.
The second market was the Old Continent, with almost half a million sold examples over six years.
However, Honda and the new Jazz want to further increase traffic in the region.
That is, while in 2007, the Japanese company sold 83.000 Jazz, the estimates target the sale of 100,000 cars by 2009. This would lead to an increase of 17% on the European market.
In the Spanish market since 2002, Honda sold 8000 Jazz, which represents 6,7 % of Honda's total turnover in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the leaders of the Spanish subsidiary calculate with a 2000-year-old example.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly alleviate the decline in the turnover of Honda in Spain.
The company's representatives predict that 22,000 copies sold will be sold until the end of this year, which represents a 16% reduction in the 2007 data.
Despite the sales terms, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which rose to 1.8% last year compared to 1.6%.
By 2010, I would also like to increase this rate to 2%.
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model.
This would be the Insight, a five - door and compact - 4370 mm long hybrid, of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 pieces a year in the world.
According to the Japanese producer, 50% of the market distribution of Insight would be carried out by the United States, while the remaining proportion would be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight's commercial introduction is due in the first months of the year after the official valence presentation scheduled for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in all respects.
The length has increased by 3900 mm (five centimeters longer), a width of 1690 mm (two centimeters wider) and a radius of five centimeters, i.e. 2500 mm.
The height is unchanged 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger compartment has become more spacious.
The larger internal space, on the one hand, is guaranteed by the new carcase and the fuel tank in the middle - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the so - called double floor - trunk for the entire rocket, currently 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres above the capacity of the first generation.
Although it adds that these dimensions relate to type 1,4 equipped with engine, since Honda Jazz's trunk is 379 litres.
Some external amendments can also be found, such as rear-side lamps or the optional panoramic glass roof, as well as the easier access to rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, compared to the first Jazz 67-degree opening angle.
The engines of the second generation Jazz are new.
At the start of the rotation, this small model can be ordered with two 1.2 and 1.4 litres of engine.
Thanks to the i-VTEC technology, the consumption of both resources is more favourable than the previous model, as well as less CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical harmonisation, while the engine provides high performance in all respects.
The power of 1.2 litres of resources is 90 watts at 60 and the maximum torque is 114 Nm at 4900.
This engine, which was 78 L in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 L and 125 grams of CO2.
The other engine, which produced 83 horses in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horses.
The 100-caliber 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 litres and its emissions are 128-gram CO2.
The conflicting "mechanical"
To develop accident prevention technologies, Nissan is a new invention of nature, exactly from the bees' world.
The Japanese company was planning a robot that was going to avoid the accidents after the bees were robbed.
The bio-memitic Car Robot Drive or BR23C might be the first step towards the development of impact prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Development Centre built this little robot in Japan, in collaboration with the research centre of the research and technology of the University of Tokyo.
Kazuhhiro Doi, Director-General for Technology PR and Research and Development, has defined that BR23C constitutes an additional extension of Nissan's four-level safety guard.
The robot makes the company’s product’s ability to impact.
During flight, each bee will develop its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to Nissan's safety guard.
However, its role is far more important than that of the complex eyes of the uterus, which, in every direction, sees more than 300 degrees of angle. Consequently, it is uninterrupted in the personal space of the bee.
To copy the function of the complex eye, engineers designed a so-called laser remote (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument shall identify the obstacles within a range of up to 2 metres from the BR23C, calculate their distance and send a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which shall immediately turn into an operation to prevent impact.
"As it happens to detect the obstacle, a small robot immediately changes direction by moving wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid impact.
The system is mostly distinguished from the instruments currently available, so that in this case the avoidable manifest will be completely automatic.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles" – explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
The avoidable manoeuvre shall not be directed upwards or downwards, nor shall it be moved in two dimensions only, and shall not be in an infinite direction or manner, in the case of bees.
That is why Nissan used a rotation function not only in the robot to speed up and slow down the impact.
"This structure only needs to process data every few seconds and respond to them.
There is no need to store the data, nor to have an intuitative logic based on previous manipulators, so it can operate without interruption with only a few dozen KB memories.
It may sound surprising, but it's not gigabyte, but we're not even talking about memory of megabyte size.
This is the first step towards developing the immediate impact prevention technology, which, according to Nissan's estimates, could involve serial cars within 10 years.
The robot operates with lithium polymer batteries that are easier and more durable than lithium-ion.
In the future, the integration of the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system may be further possible in order to reach the end by avoiding obstacles to the road.
Fear of the mortgage
We have to admit that the US Treasury Department has a lot of cash that can be invested, and there's no reason for it.
Since the crisis is on their necks, and that Americans do not question the drivers of credit banks who can be questioned, they created an entertaining and informative online game of "Bad Credit Hotel".
It's "The Hotel of Rosz's Loans"... or "Galibs."
The accommodation and especially the receptional búskomor picture suggest that we consider it once more, twice, in fact three times, whether the time has come for the credit.
And above all, where to demand a loan, because this is probably the point.
Information on the website is really useful, but little detail.
It's more like a bunch of guys than the public.
But what would happen if we complete the game?
For example, the hotel would show up in our dreams room.
Actually, that's something, because we don't even want to dream about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens up capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that it would provide equity to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay $9 billion for its company's capital 21% after Morgan Stanley's stock exchange fell much on the stock market.
One week after the preliminary agreement was announced, the two banks said that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s stock shares at a unit price of $25.25, which is a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price shall remain at more than 19% of the value of the securities in the book of 31 August.
MUFG invests another $6 billion in the purchase of transferable securities, which provide a 10% return rate and a conversion rate of $31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, the average rate of the global transaction is €29, which is 28% higher than the current rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock price decreased by around 17.79% on average and closed at 23.07 dollars.
"This strategic union offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to speed up the transformation of bank holding into a company" explains John Mack, CEO of the American corporate group.
Morgan Stanley approved this new status last week, which will allow you to diversify your activities, while also under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even greater caution from corporate crises recorded on Wall Street.
According to the conditions announced on Monday, the agreement has been amended in the last few days: last Monday, Morgan reported only enough to sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about 8,5 billion dollars.
"A week ago, we thought that the share would be made entirely of stock shares" - explained Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
"But because of the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and avoid possible risks."
For the weighted average price, MUFG pays more than 7% of the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return on a share is reduced by approximately 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG may convert half of its preference shares into stock shares if the latter’s trading rate over a specified period exceeds 50% of the conversion rate, i.e. to around 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that funds from MUFG can make use of its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquid resources.
However, the speaker of the group did not want to provide precise information on the two new alliance strategic plans.
After MUFG's merger, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase the solvency rate of Tier I by about 15%, one of which will be the best in its own sector.
Morgan declared that his balance was "limitedly improved" since the end of August.
For the past few weeks, a great deal has been put in place for the group, as the exchange rate of its shares fell half, while the cost of covering the non-payment risk has run into the sky.
This cost was reduced on Monday, but remained high at around 12%.
One of the large investors of the banks remained the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers after the bankruptcy and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. This Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that it reached $15 billion: part of this is from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's company group.
Raphael Correa Monday declaration, Quito
The reconstruction of the Republic in the spirit of socialism of the 21st century.
This joint plan is for the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales, and Correa of Rafael in Bolivia.
Following the pattern of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa explained his ideas about the new creation on Sunday.
His mission was successful because 64% of the voters voted in favour of the referendum by yes according to official results, which accounted for 80% of the votes.
This means that 28% of the population voted by gender, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% were given by voters.
50% + 1 votes were needed to adopt the draft Constitution.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the exit of the electoral offices and both the counting carried out by a civil society organisation proved to be a huge addition of 'yes' votes by 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa, by the way, spoke about the victory of his draft Constitution on Monday night.
"The Constitution has won an overwhelming victory," said Quito, and said thanks to the Spaniards at the office of the governor in Guayaquil, southwest of Guayaquil.
As you know, Mr Correa Cahávez, Mr Morales, President of Chile, congratulated Michelle Bachelet.
According to the report of the Watch Mission of the United States of America (OAS), the vote took place in a calm atmosphere, the main topic being a 444 exact text, which incorporated the principles of "new socialism" protected by the President.
The proposed Constitution is a state authority in the service of the economy, maintaining the State's right to 'designate development' for a country that is essentially based on oil production by foreign companies and the currency sent by migrants.
The draft Constitution of Correa, which was elected in 2006, strengthens the powers of the Heads of State, who can obtain a mandate for a maximum period of two consecutive periods and is entitled to disintegrate the assembly.
Correa has already announced that she would like to live with this opportunity and will again compete for the Prime Minister's mandate in February 2009.
The President has already started to introduce this in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, and half of the population is living below the standard of living.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of a parine facility that is based on US anti-drug measures.
Released in the 19 hostages in Chad
Egypt's commando hit on the kidnappers who took ten days to hostage eleven tourists and their eight escorts.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were held in the desert for ten days, from which they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released in Chad during the morning by a Egyptian commando.
Apparently in good condition, around 4:30 p.m. an aircraft arrived at the Al-Maza military base directly linked to the international airport in Cairo.
The hostages were forbidden to declare themselves to the press and immediately transferred to a hospital in the outskirts of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and the kidnappers were "no ransom fees", said Zoheir Garanna Egyptian tourist minister at the airport.
On September 19, the hostages were taken captive on the foot of Mount Ouana in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where safarin took part.
In the group there were 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and a Romanian woman) and eight Egyptians: two tour drivers, four drivers, one border guard and a safari organiser, the director of the Ayptian travel agency.
According to information from a Egyptian security manager, a 30-member special commando arrived on two helicopters at the scene where the hostages were impacted directly before the flood.
"There was a fire fight between the troops, half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled," said the chief who requested his name to be heard.
He also said that a total of 150 special teams were sent from the Egyptian Villam Brigade to Sudan, where German and Italian commandos were added.
The Italian diplomatic leader in Belgrade, Franco Frattini, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We must recognise that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and efficient intervention of our secret service men and action groups," said the following further details.
He also denied that they would pay a ransom for the hostages.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army announced that during the patrol they had arrested a highwayman on which the kidnappers traveled. Six of them were killed (including the warlord) and two were arrested.
According to the army, the hostages were in contact with a rebel organization in Darfur, the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U) that was immediately deported by the relevant organisation.
Lettres - "the quiet majority" of the culture
The debate on the financing of culture is currently at the heart of the news news news and the election campaign that is currently taking place.
That's all we can do.
But a piece of our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who will raise his word to illustrate the ridiculous amounts of the small museums, archives, archeological dignitaries and national historical monuments on the edge of hunger?
Which political sea reminds the federal government that he does not care about the monuments and the buildings that form part of the cultural heritage?
Or that neither Quebec nor Canada do there exist laws that really guarantee the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only turned three and a half million euros for the restoration of the Castle of Chinon in the Valley of Loire?
The Constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage must be harmonised for all citizens, all elected representatives and all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Federation of the Québec Historical Associations (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec), more than 40 000 volunteers of the company on cultural heritage, archives and genetics are involved in the research of history, as well as in the preservation of a large number of private archives and archeological records, with a minimum budget.
Often, these organizations protect our heritage with teeth and protest with the last power of the suffocator when real estate developers and decision-makers direct their bulldozers to our old buildings and forgotten funerals.
When will anyone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Publicization of part of Fortis Bank of Benelux
By partial nationalisation, Benelux countries are helping the US credit market crisis as a first European problem, in Belgium, fortison: the three countries are supporting the financial and insurance institution with Hungarian interests.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have agreed at the highest level on the matter at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s competition responsibility.
The Bank of Fortis in the euro area is the first major crisis in waves in the context of a crisis in the international money market for more than a year, so decisions in the case of the Bank can therefore be considered to be of some importance.
According to the decision born on Sunday night, nearly half of all three states (49%) purchase the bank's existing ownership there.
The bank will certainly sell part of its interests, including, above all, the insurance activities purchased from the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares in Fortis started falling steep last week, and in the second half of the week there have already been major crises at the Institute.
However, many agree that the bank is too large to allow it to go bankrupt with 85 000 employees.
The company's papers only fell to around 12 percent on Friday, 14 years old.
Since January, the value of the shares decreased by more than two thirds.
In terms of current stock prices, the total market share of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to corporate managers, this is not realistic.
The management of the company has, by the way, caused uncertainty in the overseas market regarding the adoption of the USD 700 billion package plan for the loss of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have risen slightly.
On Friday, a new CEO was appointed in charge of the bank by Philip Dierckx.
The financial institution has also been looking for private buyers, but no one has applied for a substantial offer so far.
The Belgian Government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry about losing their money.
There have been no panic among the bank's clients so far, the accounts have not been hacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has an independent account and has purchased leasing companies.
Rats in a henhouse
In America, life insurance and health insurance companies often refuse to conclude insurance contracts with the applicant on the basis of human drug purchase data.
Data protection professionals fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme which, in all cases, binds the use of the pharmacopoeia data to the consent of the person concerned.
It must be independent of its hands, otherwise we will trust the fox with the hemp", says Richard Dick, the developer of the drug prescriptions for the Washington Post.
The insurance companies depend on the health of the client concerned and the amount to be incurred in the event of damage, and if they consider the risk to be too high, they do not commit any insurance with them.
The person was sent for medical examination and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the outcome of the examination.
Dick found a much cheaper procedure for ten years: by using the customer's identification number, it easily obtains what medicines he bought in the last year and a half, and the program itself concludes in what kind of disease he suffers from and what his health is.
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol, it suggests that your blood fat levels are virtually high, which is immediately listed as a higher risk category.
Several versions of the programme are on the market, some of which also define a risk factor, so the insurer has little to do, even though small difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include the use of some medicines for several purposes, such as certain compounds for migraines or heat waves, but also for depression.
The latter is considered to be a significant risk-enhancing factor for business insurers, not the former.
There were separate companies to request and process the data, and before they obtained the necessary information from the pharmacy, they asked for the patient's consent.
They are now required by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their failure to do so.
Some companies are further processing the results of laboratory tests and also linking it to drug consumption data so they can provide even more accurate pictures of the health status of patients.
There are increasing numbers of companies with access to data, and monitoring of use will be more and more difficult.
There is a separate health data protection law, but the scope applies only to health care providers and insurers.
Before the convention, there is a bill that gives the authorities control over firms specialising in the provision of data.
Dick Richard sees that this is not enough: he has therefore developed his programme, which would make the transmission of the data to the express consent of the person concerned.
The other question is that the person concerned may not deny the contribution, otherwise the insurers will not conclude a contract with him.
So all the hens, however, are referring to the welfare of the fox.
Global Marseille menu
Double trade between the European Union and India
As the mutually leading trading partners of the European Union and India, the agenda of the 9th Summit has also been dominated by this issue, along with the other, mostly global, problem.
There will also be a French-India summit today, where nuclear cooperation will be mainly.
The European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given greater involvement in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet managed to reach a common denominator, to support the permanent membership of Newdelhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not therefore violated at the 9th Summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President of the Union and President of the Commission Manuel Barroso and High Representative of Javier Solana, welcomed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in India, with whom they agreed that they would double in five years, i.e. a large hundred billion euro.
Considering that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an ambitious objective.
In this respect, in a legal sense, the twenty-two bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been summed up, i.e. air traffic may continue in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the settlement.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU is India's first trading partner, New York is only the ninth place in the line of EU partners.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
The recent situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism on both sides, was condemned in every form and called for a UN conference.
The closing of the Doha trade round was also threatened, although both of them have a large part of their success so far.
The EU has confirmed that it maintains its energy and climate programme, i.e. it wants to reduce its emissions by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed to conclude a global agreement at the climate conference scheduled for the future and to reduce the production of greenhouse gases by 50 per cent by 2050.
I would also like to prevent the rise in food prices and to support an international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is going to the French capital today, where he is planning to conduct a business on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at the bilateral meeting.
In Paris, they trust that French companies will receive 20 billion euros in order to build nuclear reactors in India.
The agreement would take 15 years, according to the information provided by the News Agency.
More than three hundred Italian book publishers in Frankfurt
Italian publishers represent themselves with a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishing houses will be present at the most important international copyright meeting at the 60th Buchmesse Fair.
This year, there are 7 000 exhibitors from 101 countries to the Frankfurt International Book Fair, 171.790 square meters, where more than 403,000 books are presented. The guest of honor will be Turkey.
At the opening ceremony of Italian Pavlon, the Italian Government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, State Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Javas and Activities: Italy, by setting up a single Italian Pont, will include 264 square metres exhibition area.
The solemn opening will be followed by a press conference at the Buchmasse 5.0 Pavilon Hall "Room Struktur", where information, trends and prospects will also be presented on the situation of Italian book publishing.
According to data, the proportion of foreign authors on the Italian publishing market continues to decrease, especially in the field of adult and youth publications.
They found the billionaire Steve Fossett plane that disappeared a year ago.
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett's plane, who disappeared on 3 September 2007 from the Nevad desert.
The wrecks have been found on a 3,000-metre high ceiling near Mammoth Lakes, which is located on the coast of California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, County sheriff of Madera, has broken up every existing doubt: "After establishing the position of the plane, we have sent out a team, and we can now be sure that this is about the plane where Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared" - said at a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Transport (NTSB) reported that a few hours after the wreck was discovered, an investigation committee was asked to identify the plane and to establish that it was really about the Bellanica 8kcab, which disappeared on 3 September 2007, on the day Fossett started a three-hour flight from Yerington, U.S.A.
Yesterday too, not far from the border of Nevada, a couple found Fossett's personal belongings near Mammoth Lakes' home.
Two IDs for Fosset, issued by the Federal Aviation Inspectorate of Illinois, some cash and a sweater.
His search for Fossett was given one month after he disappeared.
The billionaire has set up a number of peaks to put himself in history.
In 2002, the sixth attempt, he was first able to fly around with a balloon: two weeks alone.
Three years later, he was able to avoid the land without landing.
There are several records of flight over the Andes at 15.445 feet [15.45 m] that he performed with a second pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
An unusual, but also original and firm-world hobby with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few words, this is the latest "competition" of Mercedes-Benz, which the German car manufacturer has tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
This is why SUV GLK's introduction campaign from 17 October will be surprising and unusual due to its traditional content.
Because the advertising campaign accompanying the introduction of the new vehicle is a media communication tool that is not yet known, including by means of utopitic 3D posters that have not yet been used in Italy.
The giant plakat action, consisting of three stages, will dominate the central shopping street of Milan by 15 November, Corso Como.
The first phase of this new type of media communication begins with the car-to-side presentation, in which the new SUV will be seen with special glasses distributed around Corso Como, almost real bikes and in three-dimensional form.
The image viewer will feel like the car's coming out of the poster.
After that, the innovative Elumina8 technology, each detail of the new GLK, will be seen with each detail of the new GLK, and then come together in a uniform way.
There is no doubt that Mercedes, with this promotion, is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype advertising world of the automotive industry.
Is it possible to raise the interest of prospective customers?
Let's show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
They're probably out of orbits.
But who is this 150-200 boy and girl who is now ashamed of Italy? Members of the group called "Ultras Italia", which has been following the chosen one for years, and which, in fact, has not, so far, caused too much trouble.
I've never been caught by the opponents.
The core of the group is on the right.
The chief organisers come from Trivento.
And also from Verona, Padov, Triest and Udin.
They have been joined by smaller groups of scattered groups from Campania and Puglia (in fact only a few units).
Italian flags were drawn on which the hometown of the Surgeons had been marked: these were taken off on Saturday so that they could not be identified.
They're following the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they were faced with a real Nazi cheerleading team with the Drunkers of Levski.
The Italian football society has 144 tickets for Italian athletes, and they have tickets for these names, making it easier to check out the cheerleading team.
The Ministry of Home Affairs has also checked everyone: there was no one in Sofia who was in the process, no one who would have been banned from the stadium visit.
Four Italian cheerleaders with a record of football are denied ticket and departure.
At the moment, the Ministry of Interior is waiting for protocols from the Sofia Police and then takes the necessary measures: those who have been arrested or identified during the riots may be banned by five years.
This is an international ban, which applies not only to visits to Italy but to all the stadiums in Europe.
So our football hooligans can't put their feet on any football field.
Fortunately.
However, we must also fear that the Huligans will be found in followers, namely, that only one hundred and fifty people will join.
"But this fire must be suffocated, it must not be excused for anyone who behaves like this," said the Ministry of Home Affairs.
So it's better to keep our eyes open, especially since it's getting close to Wednesday's match day, in Lecca.
In Puglia, there is a small cell that supports Italian ultrates.
Tomorrow, the Monitoring Service will be held and on Tuesday, the Security of Sports Events Committee, which may count on one of the departments of the Home Security Service, will be responsible for secret services dealing with the promotional behaviour.
"Duce-Duce's scanning and flying arm under the Italian hymn, no crime in Bulgaria..."
He expressed this idea, in a rather unfortunate way, by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago to the head of the Office of the Interior's observer (the post was taken by Francesco Taglite, and before Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was the chief chief of police of Triest, the city where he has been working since 2002 with a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group.
What Mazzili claims true is not allowed to live Ducé in Bulgaria, but the behavior of the 150-200 promoters was shameful.
I'm not a sociologist, I'm the first person in the surveillance service, but the crimes must be judged in the country where the crime was committed.
Until now, this group has not caused any trouble, we need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to continue.
But let's talk a little bit about the hymnosis in Italy: it's not a crime, but, if I can say that, it's not a matter of being well-being."
