European inflation has slipped on food
Accelerated inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The price increase in November was higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro zone, with annual inflation of 3.1 per cent after 2.6 per cent in October - reported by the Union's Statistics Office in Luxemburg.
The official forecast is only 3 percent likely - reported by Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian central bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut the base metal, saying that the reduction would lead to inflation spirals in conjunction with rising commodity prices and unemployment.
The ECB wishes to keep inflation rates close to two per cent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in its twenty-two traps: "you have to talk" about inflation so that you don't have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, inflation in November accounted for 3.3 per cent as twelve years; in Spain, inflation rose from 3.6 to 4.1.
The euro zone inflation has been reduced to high food and energy prices.
The fixed-term wheat quotations rose by 88% and the soya beans have reached the highest price since 1973.
Food and milk products also had to pay significantly more in 2007.
The world market price for oil increased by 52 percent this year, and last month, almost 100 dollars were spent on a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent this year to 1.9 per cent in 2008, but inflation will already fall to 1.9 in 2009.
The 12-month inflation rate is estimated to be around 3 per cent over the next 3-4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to have reduced its interest rate twice during 2008.
You see a government crisis in Gallup
The Fidesz’s support cycle increased significantly after long stagnation by early December, so since 2002 it has now had the largest camp, while Gallup has not yet reached such low socialist support of 13 percent.
In the case of certain parties, the difference would mean more than two thirds (71 percent) of MPSP's one-fifth of its support because of the greater determination of opposition voters.
The MDF and the SZDZ are estimated to be below the parliamentary threshold: their support for the entire population is two per cent.
The supporters of both camps are one percent more among the Commissioners.
The economic public voice further deteriorated to the previous bottom point - it has never been so high, 41 percent of those who considered the country's economic situation to be very bad, while a further 46 percent said it was rather bad.
Families are now more pessimistic about the change in their financial situation after spring and summer prospects.
For the following year, half of the population suffers from further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In December, more than all previous surveys of Gallup, 71 percent of those who asked thought that the Prime Minister was wrong rather than doing his job well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13 percent of the interviewers trust or rely very much, while Viktor Orbán has 38 percent support.
In the Prime Minister, 54 percent do not trust him at all, 27 percent in the President of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political situation is the extent to which society is considered to be part of the idea of managing dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister without changing the government.
While 35 percent of the government and the Prime Minister wanted to remain after the disturbances last October, this ratio is now only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33%) see only the solution in terms of new elections.
The interest in referendums is that 60% of those who have been asked answer the question about the intention to participate is sure to go and another 20 percent say that they would probably go.
As a comparison, "this Sunday's parliamentary election" would only be 55 percent sure, and another 15 percent would consider it likely that the result of the referendum would not be questionable on the basis of the intentions of today.
The students' fees are 74, 79, and 84 percent of the hospital's daily fee would say no.
If we look at the same proportions as those who promise to participate in the referendum alone, 81, 84 and 89% of voters would remove the introduction of fees, fees and daily hospital fees.
The most expensive Auchan, the Tesco, raised almost the fifth.
In Budapest's trade triangle, hypermarkets held an average increase of 16 percent last year, with the difference that the VAT did not rise this year.
Daily Economy Article
This year, on average, the daily Christmas basket increased by 16 percent this year in Budapest's trade triangle, but in each hypermarket there was an increase of over a thousand HUF in value.
Since the prices were already 'out of December' in the food supply shops, as a percentage of the former high base had not shown any dramatic dwindling.
Obviously, however, it is scary for consumers to see that what they had received last year under 9 000 HUF is not yet available for tens of thousands.
The Napi basket crossed the ten thousand forints with the least 91 forints in the examined hypermarket.
The highest basket value was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003 the basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The prices of Unicum and the living fish are almost at last year's level, but they're very expensive with turkey juices, nuts and coyotes.
KSH's records were followed by flour and bread in stores, even though we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
Competition did not suppress the price of the product under 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this business that the price of the two-litre replacement bottle Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so that only 257 forints were requested for the product, together with the deposit fee.
However, this year, Auchan showed the most expensive in the sun’s basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, compared to Christmas prices last year, Cora 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased prices by about 18-18 percent in the Napi basket.
Compared to last year's most expensive basket value, the difference was 12 per cent, while last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive growth is 21 per cent.
In Forint, the average growth was 1480.
Last year, the average price increase was 1206 forints, with last Christmas having had an effect on prices of VAT rises.
It is precisely that this process has been pooled into trade, and apparently it has not been possible to decide what pricers are using for a product, because they have been unable to calculate the impact on consumption.
(If the trader plans a product's rotational speed wrong, it may be of great benefit to the price adjusted for traffic intensity.)
As a result of the VAT, last year the price increase of the Napi basket was so extreme that the price difference was more than 1720 forints than in 2006, while the lowest price was just 844 forints.
This year, this extremism has not been shown, since the most expensive 1630 forints were more than last year, and the cheapest was 1284 forints.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, disastrous price increases have been shown, over a period of less than 30 percent in less than 20 months, the daily consumer goods in hypermarkets have increased by more than 30 percent.
(This is not necessarily evidenced by KSH data: the statistical office will increase by more than 30 per cent over a period of 12 months for some basic food.
For example, along with flour at the egg.)
According to the daily basket, this seems almost impossible, since the price level of a rather expensive product was almost 10 percent higher than the base in the worst case than last year.
The suppliers of flour appear to be in a stronger position than the eggs, a dramatic price increase has been overcome on the multi-stakeholder.
In the golden triangle of trade, hypers are not complaining, they are constantly reporting for a good year.
According to our experience, in the three shops visited, the prices no longer interest the customers.
They buy a lot of food from everything, and they take the durable food from the posters.
On Wednesday morning, in all three stores, there were serious trends in front of the money prices, because the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, we know that traffic is increasing in the countryside, many of us complain to research firms that even their plans will be out of income, not only for food, but also for durable consumer products.
In many places, they can save the disinfectants
This year over 1,000 infections have been registered in hospitals, mainly due to inadequate use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the hardness of beds, the overload of staff do not favour the stopping of infections, states the head of the head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
They save money in many places on disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection has been diagnosed in the Traumatology Department of John's Hospital.
A man who was exposed to antibiotics after a serious accident showed bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was separated.
Similar infections occurred at the beginning of the year.
A major car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly later, MRSA had to return and no major surgery had been carried out because of the bacteria in its body since then.
This year, 1094 multi-resisted disease-induced hospital infections have been reported in the National Nonocomial Survey System by the head of the National Epidemiological Center, Böröcz Karolina.
This means that so many infections caused by multiresist disease have certainly been registered in hospitals, others are not known.
Approximately two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. Methicillin-oxocillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria are carried by one third of people in their nose without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. torheuitis, mandulaitis, skin infections, infection) respond well to antibiotics, can be well cured.
However, if antibiotics are used too much or inadequately, a highly resistant bacteria from bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop quickly.
In patients with reduced body, elderly or low body weight, the immune system may lead to severe hospital infections such as infection or blood poisoning.
According to the doctoral director of the John Hospital, there is nothing unusual about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be mixed with the patrol, MRSA is not only there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the disease is not investigated.
Resistance to antibiotics
"We separate these patients, treat the patient in rubber mittens and mask, and have the appropriate antibiotics for their treatment" said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients entering the hospital will first be examined whether MRSA is present in their body, but no infection can always be avoided.
No fashion sampling
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current domestic hospital conditions and circumstances are not favourable to preventing the development and spread of multi-resist agents, says Böröcz Karolina.
Since this infection is typically occurring in hospitals, elderly homes, hospitals should check out the incoming patients and patients carrying MRSA should be separated immediately.
However, in Hungarian hospitals there is no microbiological sampling in fashion.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these studies.
In most cases, this is how the patient becomes exposed to MRSA, said the head of the epidemiological centre's head of class.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are domestic guidelines for the treatment of certain infections, pathogens.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies should be carried out to prevent resistance to medicinal products, but not at all.
Microbiological sampling is even more rare in the supply and supply of walking disease and basics, Böröcz Karolina reported.
Slurry on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA spreads most often from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
This is why handwash, gloves, masks, has a very large role to play, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA spreads with contagion, contact, but under domestic hospital conditions it is not always possible to separate the infected patient.
In fact, the disease rooms are often crowded, often very close to each other by beds, where, from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 metres apart.
Unfortunately, it is also seen that Böröcz Karolina noted that in hospitals in an unfavorable financial situation, they are saving on disinfectants, few nurses, many patients, and thus even more likely to develop infections.
According to Böröcz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are being taken, there may be less evidence of such an infection, or a further spread of the pathogen may be stopped.
Governing Board against MRSA
The management of MRSA infection causes huge expenditure on health insurance companies, and therefore they fight everywhere.
In England, for example, the Government Programme included a reduction in the prevention and occurrence of MRSA.
It appears that the programme is a successful, reported data indicate a decreasing trend in MRSA infections in England.
The priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) include the prevention of multi-resistent pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by such diseases.
There was no drunk police chief responsible for the death accident.
The official expert opinion on the fatal accident caused by police station XXII has been completed.
It can be excluded that you would have led your post in a drunk or bloated state, in the meantime, to a district police captain in XXII, who was on Tuesday to the death of a pedestrian, informed Attila Morvai, spokesperson on Friday after the expert opinion on this issue was completed.
The expert opinion supported the primary test result, which already established that the former police captain had not consumed alcohol before he was placed behind the wheel.
At the time, the head of the XXII district headquarters, with its own passenger car, hit the 55-year-old man who did not want to get to the other side of the road on Tuesday in Kossuth Laus Street in the district of XXII.
(The latter, therefore, that the pedestrian did not pass through the Zebra, the non-reflecting circumstances under the rules of the KRESZ, must also be given priority by the car in the turn.)
The pedestrian lost his life after transport to the hospital.
As a result of what happened, the police chief in the district resigned his post and asked him to remain in custody, according to the police report, because the case was so shaken.
In the case, the Budapest Detective's Attorney's Office is conducting an investigation.
Attila Morvai also stated that the former police chief from the beginning cooperated with the investigating prosecutors.
More EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Three loans for education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy support were signed by János Veres Finance Minister and Vice-President Marta Gajecka of the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Friday in Budapest.
The European Development Bank (EIB) has approved Hungarian budget financing for transport and environmental projects under Cohesion Fund in 2006 a EUR 300 million framework, of which the parties have already concluded a loan agreement of EUR 100 million, the agreement that has just been signed is about using the remaining EUR 200 million.
Education-related projects also provide budget funding for the EUR 150 million loan agreement.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, the use of the remaining EUR 150 million later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million, which is primarily used by the budget for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
The meeting was also held on subway 4.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of metro financing with the EU, they will return to whether and how to change the original contract.
According to John Veres, this can take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The loans cover EURIBOR, with a duration of eight years and without maintenance commission, will be provided by the EIB.
Bulgaria is the EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - all of Europe is looking at a few of the countries mentioned earlier.
What, where and who, the EU is still buying the cheapest, but rapidly expensive market?
Analysing the division of Re/Max Bulgarians.
The most popular property purchase destination in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and coastal houses.
Among the mountains, the most popular is Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and Albena, the "Aranypart", the "Napospart", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebár, but more and more people are looking for real estate in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balcsik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, the central part of the country will be interested in investors - so Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people will also buy in the area of the said cheap Russ.
The capital, Sofia, also boasts attractive opportunities, commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its best path to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, so next to summer and winter seasons it will be a priority destination for the other two seasons.
For this reason, forward investors are already buying large, such as in Bansko.
Analysts say that in Bulgaria, real estate is being bought and their lives are trying to change their way of life.
Most customers come from English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
The Maltese and Cyprus investors are also present, and the Black Sea and ski havens are traditionally a lot of Russian buyers.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Renovated properties are purchased at a price of between 50 and 100 000 euros or settled old houses for 5-15 000 euros and then renovated.
They need good accessibility and communication opportunities, important to them the proximity of a city, shops and a local doctor in general.
The second category is for the holiday buyers (Bulgaria on the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of business investors who buy in the hope of medium or long-term value growth.
The increase in capital real estate continues to increase, as demand is increasing.
In the European Union, real estate prices are lowest in Bulgaria, but have increased by 21 per cent in the last five years.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially above the increase in payments.
Fodor and six Hungarian per cent
Mr Fodor, Minister for the Environment and Water, said that the expert meetings will be completed on Tuesday, and on Wednesday after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers will continue with the international climate regime post-2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Guide, which will have the efforts to reduce emissions by 2012 following the period set out in the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a strong debate on this between developing and developed countries.
The United States also indicated that it does not intend to negotiate precise figures at present, although it tends to reach an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another important issue for the conference is whether developed countries also undertake to provide both financial and technological assistance to those countries that are at risk, while reducing emissions.
There is also agreement on aid to developing countries.
The subsidy fund, which is provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by 16 members of the Management Board, is expected to be available within the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF) in Piac and Profit.
Six percent of Hungary
Mr Fodor, Minister for the Environment and Water, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to preserve the role of flag vessels in global climate efforts and to facilitate the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that by 2020, the EU will undertake to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent compared to 1990, regardless of the success of the ' post-2012 convention' and is ready to take up a reduction of up to 30%, where other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to commit their responsibilities and capabilities.
Mr Fodor referred to the overall reduction of 5.2 per cent in the number of countries joining the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, including 8 per cent in the EU, then another 15 Member States.
In Hungary, the obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the period from 1985 to 1987 will be fulfilled by our country. - recalls the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
The high bet is Balin, because within two years the long-term international climate agreement should be reached, otherwise its entry into force would certainly come into effect after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by another system of international emission reductions, as required by the IPCC, the UN's Nobel Peace Prize, international scientific body for climate change, as demonstrated in its latest report.
This would be a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in the average temperature of the Earth above 2 degrees Celcius, which scientists believe would have very serious and irreversible consequences.
On YouTube, the British army is recruiting.
Records of activities in Iraq and Afghanistan are published on the video division by British military units with which they promote themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) was first given to YouTube: special developments in Afghanistan have been recording videos of their Taliban operations since March 2006 - the BBC.
These miniature cameras, equipped with helmets, are controlled by the Air Force Operation Commander, and then sent to London, where the Hungarians upload them to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
Air force soldiers have already recorded 139 videos on the Internet in this form, and their "channel" has been viewed to over 75 thousand.
The British Ministry of Defence has registered videos of both Iraqi and Afghanistan in spring 2007, while the British Ministry of National Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the Iraqi International Peace Service (NFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Action in Afghanistan
According to the Air Force's original intention, he recorded videos for recruitment purposes, and the Ministry of Defence believes that it is also good for the general public to know the real purpose of the military's foreign presence.
The propaganda that has been published in this form is almost nothing compared to the traditional television recruits, said BBC's defence expert Gordon Mackenzie - but he has an inextricably political message, as it has demonstrated in specific form the existence of military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
In addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, the army is also concerned with the distribution of amateur videos, which, for example, show the death of soldiers: a little hypocrite, a "official" propaganda film, because officers speak the maximum loss, but do not show the bloody side of the fight.
As regards the Iraqi and Afghan military field, many videos have already been released to the Internet, which has been made through sharp attacks, but the British army has just recently received it.
In other ways, Americans are recruiting with a shooting game called America's Army for free, in which the player can hide directly into the skin of soldiers in a more or less life-long simulation.
It's gonna be a fun Christmas for the ministries.
Minister of Labour Lamperth Mónika does not seem to be emotional: instead of having a Christmas party, he will hold an annual work meeting for his colleagues who can owe you pogues and coffee from 2007.
There's a ministry where there's a live music party, and there's a Christmas mood in the hearts of the officials.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and Swedish table - so the power is fun.
State agencies are ready for Christmas.
The biggest state-of-the-art Christmas party is held this year in the defence wallet, but HM is not waiting for the Ministry's employees.
In Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive a gift, guests of the current soldiers in foreign missions will be present at Mission in Mission, but they will also host a press reception.
The wallet's about 25 million on the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) are fired from the rest of the wallets.
The GKM's party is held at the home of the future, with a total of 4 320 000 Forints, and about three hundred guests from six hundred ministries.
They're going to stick to the Christmas mood at the funeral of the wallet, but they're going to have to be performers and destroys.
The National Justice Council (OIT) was held on Wednesday - there were concerts and dinners.
The rent was spent in a million Forints, and over four hundred invited people spent the remainder.
We believe that one of the NGOs' departments is also official for another Christmas celebration: this is organised by a competition management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, from EU funds.
The purpose was to rent the building of the theater.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt because we failed to reach the competent authority.
I don't need a suit.
The OIT building was not only a guest of the NFU, but also of the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held Luca's Day ball instead of Christmas 7 December.
He didn't ask for any money for the use of the OIT halls.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the minister's toast, and he could have danced after dinner.
The question [orgo] was asked: the prom was not mandatory at all for evening dress or suit.
Puritan will host a party in health, work and municipal purses.
The Ministry of Health organises a programme and celebration for 400 000 Forints for employees in its own building.
Mr Lamperth Mónika's Minister for Labour is officially waiting for his staff not for a Christmas party but for a work session at the end of the year.
They expect 100 guests who - the press department - will only get coffee and pogue, so they'll take the party out of 350,000 Forints.
However, the Minister of Government of Bajnai Gordon will simply be coccting with his colleagues in the Honorary Department of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is holding a Christmas event in its own big room, to which 436 workers are waiting.
Each guest wants 2500 forints for the Christmas party - a Swedish reception and a drink.
Ever since John Veres was a minister, the PM's employees have been on Christmas every year.
It will not, however, be a bulldozer, but it will not only be a Ministerial speech but also a date for the afternoon.
On January 20th, the agricultural wallet will give a new year's reception, the Ministry's Christmas will be lost.
The reception is held in Vajdahunyadvár, the City League, and according to the register, 1000 forints per head per hundred guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple permanent reception, for which only foreign diplomas accredited to Hungary will be official.
These bets start with a short minister's toast every year and end with a repressive bite.
There is no Christmas party at all with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture - reported with [origo] on the competent press departments.
The price of the official Christmas of the environmental wallet was not available in the press department.
At any rate, over four hundred people were invited to the party at the Museum of Applied Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are increasing.
On Friday, their strike committee will be formed by the League Trade Organisations and the National Federation of Labour Councils.
On Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act, a large meeting protesting on Saturday will begin.
The action will certainly lead to a significant build-up in transport, as rail transport will almost completely stop, and will strike at the BKV for 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the Liga Trade Organisations presented details of their Monday strike organised jointly with the National Labour Councils Association.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also take place, which will coordinate Monday activities.
There will be a large assembly protesting on Saturday, and organisations joining the strike will cease work for an indefinite period of time if they cannot reach agreement with the government.
This means that it has not been marked - on the day of Parliament's vote on the health insurance law - the date of completion of the strike started.
If the Parliament did not adopt the Health Insurance Act, trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
If the law is voted on, then the strike committees will come together and decide on the continuation.
On the basis of the Monday agenda of the Parliament, it is possible that the health insurance law will be voted only in late nights or nights.
As a result of the attacks launched on Monday, it is possible to expect significant resurrections in transport: the work will be stopped for an unspecified period of time by the railways, and a part of the public transport in Budapest will be stopped at the beginning of the morning, more than half of the Volan companies.
At the same time, there will be half-track roadblocks on many points in the country.
A number of trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the strike call, and their list is constantly updated on Liga's day.
Some organisations have reported strikes for an indefinite period, and others have declared temporary employment sentences.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Free Trade Union of MÁV and Railway Workers (VDSZZZZZ) could not even agree on sufficient service, and more and more people travel on the railways as Christmas holidays are approaching.
According to previous communications, the BKV will strike for 13 hours, between 7 and 9 o’clock in Budapest Airport, with four hours’ strike from the LIGA Electricity and Heat Energy Trade Unions, the Pedagogian Trade Organisation and the Democratic Union of Pedagogics.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes in national, changed times, two-hour alert strike by the Democratic Union of Workers in the SZEF Health and Social Sector (EDDSZ).
The four claims made by Liga are the most important for the government to withdraw the proposal for the reform of health insurance and to call for a new concept for a social debate.
The second claim is to gradually introduce the new pension accounting method due from next year.
The third is to ensure that early retirement already exists before 2010, the possibility of perpetuating the scheme for useful work.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Organisation of Railway Workers (VDSZZZZZ) of Liga Trade Unions does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport on railway lines is waiting for another offer.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard has raised the country's risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded for Better Hungary in August of this year, increased the political risk of Hungary and the region according to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division).
The company's "risk warning" was said: in the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "a violent ethnic conflict between the Gypsies and non-Cigs in Hungary could be created in the short term, even by the poisoning of existing ethnic tensions".
The main reason for this is that the policy strategy of the Hungarian Guard is believed to be aimed at profiling such an act, the research institute added.
As it was written, all this can be attributed to one of the main failures of Hungarian political actors: 'the public debate of Roma affairs has been transferred by public actors to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings, who could build a political strategy against the Gypsy-Hungarian conflict'.
This will deepen the problem, prevent normal dialogue, strengthen extremism and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts - it is believed.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard have resulted in a major deterioration of Hungary's image of Hungary in terms of stability and democratic development.
It is recalled that from the autumn of 2006 onwards, part of the reorganization of radical and far-reaching groups in Hungary has become more and more publicised, that more and more organisations called "national self-defence" have been formed in Hungary since summer 2007.
"The common feature of this concentration is that they define themselves as a civil organisation, while they openly declare the preparation of their members - whether armed - for defence (catastropic, defence, police) functions, and the police, the military, or the state, have added them to them.
It has been noted that all this is done in accordance with the method which, based on the political and prudence of society, seeks to put in a different political effort.
The emphasis on civil society and the form of association are therefore not only intended to avoid the legal losers of court registration in the case of these associations, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, there is a potential threat to the Hungarian Guard in several neighbouring countries, and ultranationalist political actors in certain neighbouring countries are seeking to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
This has an impact on the political stability of the region".
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Europe, so the political risks for the whole region have increased.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union for the Outright Side (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, there are the massive Roma disturbances that occurred in one quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
BNU has decided to use this to make use of the freedom of movement, saying that the purpose of the organization is "national self-defence".
For the past 17 years, they believe that there has been a "ciigányterroror" in Bulgaria, but the state remains unblemished and indifferent - reminds me of the Political Capital.
They added: the initiative launched a lively debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it was written, there is an increase in the risk of ethnic conflicts that some Roma organisations in Bulgaria have announced that resistance is being created on their own.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard has been similar to the operation of the Bulgarian National Guard so far, it cannot be excluded that the Roma in Hungary react to the threat by organising their own self-defence - in the warning of the political capital.
Attila Judász, the director of Political Capital's research, said to the interest of the telepathic office, that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As you said, their risk analysis will be published annually and if they experience any impact on risk change, they will inform the public as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Not everything is red in font for the holiday
In Hungary, the law clearly describes the red-word days, and around the holidays, work-day transfers have become a general practice, which will be less than that of the future.
The holiday in the EU and America is not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and holidays.
The holidays can be mostly linked to church holidays, significial historical events.
We also celebrate the new year: the last and the first day of the season is a break - the last is just to allow them to rest themselves.
By the way, we have a total of eleven red holidays all year long.
The National Festival is 15 March and 23 October, the Memorial Day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, we celebrate the establishment of the state, on May 1st, and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
We also have a two-day holiday for Easter, Püüszd and Christmas.
Since our public, national or even religious holidays are rarely due to fall for the weekend, the shifting of the work day has become practical in cases where we work just one day before or after the red letter holiday.
True, the price of extended weekends is that we do not stay away from work on previous Saturdays.
The fact that the day immediately before or after the holiday should be worked exactly when the Minister of Labour has been governed by a separate regulation for many years.
The legislation covers all employers and their employees, civil servants and civil servants.
However, it does not affect service providers, institutions and entities operating without interruption and in the course of their purpose, even on holidays.
This year, only the end of the year is changing the working order: from December 24 to December, life will stop in the country, as experience shows that the Christmas and the julvester days are "switched" by the majority of people, or use the saved freedom for this purpose.
Next year, we will have more holidays in the middle of the week or the end of the week, so we will have less work day shift than this year.
First, the calendar goes around the holiday of the work, and then the workers can stay at home for four days, interdependently.
The Saturday on 26 April will be a working day to be in exchange for the Friday day of May 2nd.
The second transfer is linked to the 23 October celebration: on Saturday, 18 October, you will have to work instead of 24 Friday.
The end of the year, however, can take a full turn in the celebration, since from 24 December there will be almost every nonstop break even if it falls on the Wednesdays.
Six awful little things to piss off your colleagues.
E-mails that we forget to send, audio mail messages that we never receive are innocent lies that we almost don't notice: these are "colored" every day at work.
Ask yourself if you're going to get the minor inconveniences, or take the gloves, and be conscious of the misunderstandings that make others feel remorse.
Tips.
"Boss, I forgot to tell you they were looking for the marketing department," says one of your colleagues.
That you missed a meeting?
In the best case, you regret and try to make amends, perhaps calling the marketing class to tell you that you forgot to deliver the message (this is a less standard solution).
Most of the time, an apology is handled.
Before it comes to an embarrassing rescue, it is worth considering what it is you can do to get unpleasant moments for your colleagues, and consciously try to avoid this.
Can you borrow something that's not yours?
It's not more annoying when you touch a document, an office or a phone, and it's nowhere.
Do you remember yesterday putting your fire machine on the table, but by morning he had a foot?
Do you perhaps reveal your lost pen on one of your colleagues' desks?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without having a chance, because they'll be justifiably angry at you for horseing their property.
Don't put me in the pocket from office envelopes, post-it, 'cause it might be awkward if you're running out of time, and you need it right away.
Are you gossiping about the private lives of colleagues?
There is no good way to stop the rumors that are already spreading.
Who, who did it to?
Where and why?
Don't put your messages on everyone's noses about your colleagues' personal life.
If one of them shares the best secrets with you, don't live back with his trust.
Bury those who have heard in themselves, and do not negotiate with your colleagues in their absence, even if others know what your colleague has done.
Are you an inextricably patient?
When you call in the office and you report a patient with a sore headache, because you have a bad feeling or feel you'd rather rest that day; think about your work, your undying things, your timeless work, your work, your timeless work, your other kind of work.
Don't fuck me up with your colleagues.
If you know that the next day you're not going to go into the office, or you might have to do something that makes you stay home, you're going to tell your colleagues, and your boss won't face you the next day.
Diving, alarming, phone calls
Did you get involved in the work, but that's how the enemy of the colleagues is coming out of it?
Did you become an unwitting ear teacher for a phone call that you wouldn't have heard?
Don't bother your colleagues with snooping, singing, talking loudly over their heads, walking around with all that shit, all that shit, all that shit, all that noise.
They can all be confusing, even if they do not fall into a project (in writing, planning, organisation).
Are you blaming other people for their mistakes?
If there's no time, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, no other reason for your forgetfulness.
Don't point to any chaos in the office, your eloquent colleagues.
Admit it when you made a mistake, and that's the disadvantage of someone else, and you're gonna get rid of her.
Ask him how you can make your mistake right, replace the default.
Do you feel too good at the office?
Macknobs and slippers: comfortable clothing for home, but not for office!
Don't wear comfortable leisure clothes if you're allowed to work.
Don't be flattered, your colleagues, and respect yourself in ordinary clothes - if your work requires you to go to the office in a nice, elegant way.
If you want to answer it, you're not interesting anymore.
A ride to the car in the usual breakfast den.
There's a special song on the radio, a fiery sound associated with electronic effects.
I'll roll up the sound.
Music has changed pace and the bass comes to the previous sounds, then the female choir is connected as real jewelry.
Zagar Wings of Love speak on Mr. 2.
Home music life has long forced us with high-quality electronic pops.
But now it looks like it's all different when you listen to the new Zagar album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, some of the new and exciting productions coming from the digital underground in Hungary, is slowly changing the overall picture, and even though fashion is again the guitar-scale garage rock, the domestic electropop also proves: there is new under the Sun.
He started off from Pecs Zságer Balázs, and you played in Yonderboi's band until, perhaps, because two grand didn't fall in a chorus - he took his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, which combines jazz, electronic dance music, pop elements, he began to break through when he was asked to co-compensate film soundtracks (e.g.
Ferenc Szezon, Turkish).
The formations at the beginning of the smaller clubs were presented by a wider audience, when their first album in Wan2 in 2002 was classified as the 50 most important domestic albums, and Zagar, in Yonderboi’s company, was exclaimed to the nearly only domestic trenders in the West as marketable.
No doubt, Zagar and the band became "trend", but no one asked if they would like to wear the label.
The orchestra reacted like it had to: made a new, better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead has just published for them to open new paths, although the title itself wishes to create continuity with the early years of the wedding.
This was one of the lines of an old band of Zságer Balázs there.
We would be in position with an aerial reference, but in addition to the airliness of the music, it has now appeared, in line with the spirit of the age, the impact of the louder guitar, rock and roll.
In these songs, the album at the Millennium premiere was presented by the singer, György Ligeti, who is currently working with the Puzzle band in England.
The album also produced a real radio slaver, the Wings of Love recorded in the ears by the six Hungarian singer "Underground Divas", who played popular music from the new morning until the night.
So it's all right (?).
The hág.hu asked Zságer Balázs.
hág.hu: This new slaver now raises the question: how many layers do you have left to play?
Zságer Balázs: The definition of layer music doesn't mean much to me.
I think that there are two kinds of light music casts; not a general and underground, not an alternative and pop, but a comedy and honest.
The so-called alternative underground music can also be flat, non-speakers, and so can only be made for sale, which makes them comerable.
But with a good pop, you can get out of the way for an honest start.
Your receptional attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language and national boundaries.
hág.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to music?
Zs.B.: In foreign countries, mostly west of us, the music of light music has larger traditions.
It's not just the sixteen-year-old class, it's the seniors.
They are more closely following the changing light music around them, because it is also considered part of contemporary culture.
häg.hu: What is the public's role in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
It feels good to have more and more concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
We have music not for purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be seen in concerts, where the impact is already on each other, but only in the moment's impenetrable changes.
Still, I noticed that if you want to answer the audience, you're no longer interesting.
häg.hu: How much do you plan on following Yonderboi's example?
She's on her solo, and she built her career west of us.
Zs.B.: We are not really on his way, no matter how sometimes they try to explain it to our music.
We're more of a team player who trusts and lets us expand in the presence of another music.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work was compared with Yonderboi’s music, since we had come out of his orchestra and left another way.
phg.hu: On the top list of Mr.2 Petőfi, the Wings of Love was placed first.
Many heard the name Zagar first about this number.
Did you deliberately open up the most popular style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't have plans to write a strike and sell the record with it.
This song is more than that.
The album was designed for the finale of the album, which we tried to break up the audio and the harder topics that we had on the album.
hág.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
What was the command?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
That's when it came to the idea that this choir should be made up of the good speakers of our own home music scene.
That's how the six-member choir, Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], Németh Juci, was then baptized by Underground Divas.
hág.hu: Did you plan the song to be like this or have the girls set it up?
Zs.B.: The number has been in an instrumental version for a long time, and then when the record came together, we thought there was something else we needed for this number.
The chorus attracted me to get my voice on it.
That night, I sang the song that the girls later learned.
It's almost the first and it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just... it
I remember that he was very enlightened back then, but of course the Davis needed it.
My voice wouldn't have worked so hard.
hág.hu: Both on the album and at the concert seemed to be in the background of the girls.
There is no solo (except Judy Jay's short voice), they don't have their own role, they sing together, and they don't make any more louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were standing in the back of the stage.
Is that deliberate?
The fact that they were standing in the back was simply a technical problem.
However, it is conscious that we did not want to share words.
It's also about forgetting our ego a little bit where he came from, let's just let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hág.hu: Which one did most work with?
Zs.B.: None of the music creative processes actually had, but they were more difficult pieces than mixing.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I play at a competition piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work for a long time, and then it was slowly everything was in place like a puzzle game.
phg.hu: Which is your favorite number from the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes all the time with concerting and "I've already let" the record.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The traitor's broker's minor sense put billions at risk.
It's insatiable.
The Czech Commercial Bank's owner, Sociéte Générale bankery in France, is the name of his former employee, Jerome Kerviel.
Because of Kerviel's loss of almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that it was more of a big player than his colleagues who wanted to catch him.
Unlike the other banks, he recognized in time the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"No less intellectual," he sounded to the police's reporting superiors.
However, as reported by the French Le Monde, Kerviel's statement shows that at the end of the last year, he obtained EUR 1.6 billion in profits.
Change not only in America
"Only I wanted to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In summer, he was able to look for half a billion euros in the US crisis.
The opportunity was felt at the beginning of the year.
In February there was news that there would be problems with so-called subprime mortgages for clients with low incomes or with past cancellation problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe this and he did a good horse.
The final profit for the year reached EUR 1.6 billion.
"I didn't know how to report the first half billion," admits Kerviel and adds that he didn't keep anything to himself.
In his statement, he admitted that he faked his reports so that it could not be discovered.
He also managed to trick his bosses, even when Eurex stock exchange began to be interested in his transactions.
Profitability of the investment
Were you afraid you'd find out?
I'd rather not.
"I just thought the fact that I was looking for 1.6 billion for the bank would calm them down."
Where did you want to risk that much?
His position was gradually achieved.
He worked at the Société Générale bank since the year 2000 after he graduated from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary moved around $51,000.
Two years later, he was a broker and became an independent broker with a $90,000 salary in 2005.
Yet he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"In 2005, during my first conversation, I knew they were looking at me wrong.
My achievement, including my professional and personal development, said Kerviel to the detectives.
The first great success came shortly after his entry.
He was looking for allianz's shares because, during the bombings in London, he put EUR half a billion into the fall of these shares.
And that started Lavina - he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses were supposed to know about everything, or they were more likely to do it.
"As long as I've been making money, they've lost their eyes."
Except there was a blow at the beginning of the year.
One day he lost a billion euros.
He wanted to bury it in the middle of January one weekend.
When he started working Monday, he stopped working at the bank.
And the bank announced a few days later that it lost five billion euros.
And how did you find out?
He got suspicious about his freedom.
"I only took four days in the last year.
The broker who doesn't have freedom is a broker who doesn't want anyone to look into his reports," he finished Kerviel.
It is possible for the Czech Republic to obtain 365 billion
The Czech Government's ministers and representatives of the European Commission have signed a total of nine operational programmes, of which the Czech Republic can obtain EUR 14 billion in the coming years (approximately EUR 365 billion).
It is about half of the total amount available by the Czech Republic from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
The seven operational programmes for the regions will cost about 125 billion dollars.
Czech companies will earn around 100 billion kroons from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion dollars, is for transport.
The Transport Programme represents the largest operating programme and 22% of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state base for transport infrastructure, which will generate an increase of 9(0.8 billion dollars next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to gain tools for innovation enterprises.
Companies should also have resources to introduce new technologies, industrial research, but more efficient methods of organisation should be used.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful ones in obtaining money from the EU funds in the context of the newly adopted countries.
The Court approved the 20-year sentence of the ex-Chairman of Nicoragui.
On Thursday, the Judiciary Court approved twenty-year prison sentences for Arnold Alemán, the former president of the country, to whom the 100 million dollars were sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud (almost USD 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and under house arrest in his warden near the capital.
The fact that the former leader of this Central American country from 1997 to 2002, will again return to the bars, according to the AP news agency, is not clear.
According to Ileana Perez, the President of the Court of Appeal will depend on the prison's leadership to allow Alemán's punishment to be charged at home or to return to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved Alemán to have regularly referred government funds to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These firm companies and their accounts were in reality relatives and their closest supporters.
He then made some of these funds at the foundation, which was founded on the financing of the 2001 election campaign by Alemán.
We have approved our budget.
That's right.
They accepted the state budget.
Why is this budget special?
This is the budget, without the support of the opposition, drawn up by the first coalition majority drawn up by this government.
This year has been passed with support from the Social Democrats last year, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Socialist Democratic Party have not been allowed to accept it.
Unlike the debate on government mistrust, before the vote, there has been no drama at this time.
The House of Representatives has accepted this generally ignored, even though the most ingenious law.
It's a certain contradiction.
All governance starts and ends in each budget chapter and item, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the powers of the government and the opposition.
This is more appreciated in the press, so you get a lot more attention in the media.
The debates of politicians are much more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The government budgets of the former Social Democrats have been under three deficits, which the 2008 budget is unable to resolve at the same time:
The first of them is the high proportion of the law on compulsory, executive expenditure, which is not only pension but also social benefits, which were approved last year by ČSSD and KSČM's silent "coalation" before the elections.
The second is, as a result of the first deficiencies, the management of the deficits.
The third limit is the deficits of public funding, i.e. the deficits of the budgets of cities and flights.
However, the highest risk is not the deficit of the public budget.
It is public and relatively controlled.
Timed bombs are budget deficits for cities and trips.
In addition to money from taxes, taxes and bank loans, many mayors are able to obtain money for other investments, often undeveloped bonds that have been disproportionately sold by their towns.
In recent years, these debts have been deleted by the massive sale of shares in energy and other distribution networks, which have been received from the State through privatisations.
They don't have that source anymore.
If we rely solely on official and verifiable facts, we shall establish that:
Like the rest of the world, our economy has been going through a growth phase for a few years, with which the Czech Socialist Party continues to boast.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to make public funding available.
Instead, the country was increasingly subject to debt.
The other countries have been given much more rational treatment than Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, with two exceptions.
This is primarily the great shame of previous governments.
We belong to the countries most at risk of poverty in global scale.
Therefore, there is no need for, for example, large social programmes, which, unfortunately, in recent years, have been completely inefficiencies.
Although this year's part of the pointless populist expenditure approved before the elections has been closed, even if it is not going to take place in the near future to set aside retirement and reform of pensions, then any policy will actually end in this country, and whoever manages it, it will be just official training.
A little overlapping is the fact that most of the money paid from government politicians generally becomes pensioners and the social benefits become mechanical distributions.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop it from being cut off by the accounting expenditure of normal expenditure.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be totally unnecessary if the former governments had not value everything that could have been done in the last decade.
If we do not really want to become mere officials from the governing politicians, then we need to be patient and calm to prepare for the further reform laws this is not too strong, knowing the coalition government that the state can only deliver from taxes and taxes.
Only these make it possible to achieve a balanced budget gradually.
Member of the Commission
Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to jointly fight against the crisis in the financial markets.
In this way, money markets cost more than $100 billion through the stock exchange.
On this stock exchange, interest rates are increased on the bank, for which money is ready to be borrowed.
For example, the US Fed puts 40 billion dollars on the stock market and makes another twenty-four available to the European and Swiss central bank.
Following the 11th attacks in September, it is now the first time that the central banks of each country have agreed in a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital, which banks could lend," said Bernard Baumohl, an advisory company at Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated operation of central banks in the United States reduced the likelihood of recession from 65% to around 50 percent," added Baumohl in his report.
In the United States, banks have already lost $60 billion because of unpaid loans.
Predictables expect additional billions of losses.
"The central banks can really be afraid of what could happen if they decided to do so," said Kieran Davies, the general publicist of ABN Amro.
It seems that it really is a bad situation," he added.
The central banks fear that if banks have difficulty in accessing loans, they will lend more money to their customers.
This would reduce the need and put the American economy in recession with possible consequences for the economic growth of the whole world.
Following the decision of the central banks, the so-called LIBOR, the interbanking interest rate used to borrow money on the interbank market in London was not achieved.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of borrowing mutual funds, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain also decreased their interest rates a few times during the autumn.
"This will have a similar effect to the further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaglio of the Reuters news agency from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Banks' move contributes to the crisis, as it does not solve the underlying problem, the fall in the American real estate market.
Klaus: Incredibly debated by ecologists
Global climate change is the biggest threat to developing countries.
President Klaus said again about the global warming problem.
He then criticised the International Conference on Climate Change held by the United Nations.
The book Blue presented in Vienna, not the Green Planet, made it a point of clerical arguments by ecologists.
Klaus believes that not only is the structure of the conference acceptable, which is a special mixture of representatives of governments and civil society organisations, but also a fundamental difference between the reality and the reality that accompany them.
"The debate there is absolutely indispensable for the structure, it is just throwing words, which are the alternatives to solving the current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of the Czech President's book, he stressed that it was very important for him, and that is why he was so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction at the fact that the book also appears in German translation, because, as he said, "I only often meet the caricatures of my opinion".
So now interested parties can read their unscrupulous opinion.
Klaus recalled that although not a climatologist, he considered that he had sufficient grounds to write such a book.
Since he was able to observe and judge professional experience, he also experienced as academics in statistics and economists.
At the end of the book, it stated that climate is constantly changing, i.e. its changes are normal, and that in the context of the global warming, all scientists do not agree that the consequences of the current changes are not too high and serious, so they do not pose a threat and that the efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
In addition, as an experienced person in the field of totalitarianism, it considers it unacceptable to impose unconfirmed opinions on others, perceived as dangerous restrictions on freedom.
He repeatedly explained to those present that "it is not against the reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant enviromentalism, which does not take account of the link between costs and benefits."
Klaus has already talked about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at Hayek Institute.
600 thousands were unable to replace their licences
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and could not change their old license in time, whose validity would expire at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can still apply for the exchange so that the offices can issue a new licence in time by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that, after the new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will start on their way without a valid right.
According to the agencies, the licence was primarily not replaced by those who no longer want to drive.
While the diseases represent a sharp fall in interest in the exchange of licences, the capital offices have been flooded with applications for the exchange of licences for which the interest has increased this week.
The Mayor's Office receives about 2,000 clients a day.
It takes about half an hour to line up.
In Prague, the license was not replaced by some 140,000 drivers.
The launch of a new license lasts 20 days.
However, the new licence may be required by a reduced period of five days.
In such a case, however, the driver must pay an extra 50-threshold.
Drivers who cannot make the mandatory change of registration by the end of the year and who are on their way with an invalid right will be threatened by a penalty from January.
The sinner must pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police may also arrange the cracking process by means of a deal.
In the case of an administrative breach, the penalty shall be 2500 kroons.
According to earlier information from the city hall, you can get a fine for someone who doesn't travel anywhere.
It's supposed to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has previously called upon the agencies to be made aware of the penalties of up to a thousand crowns.
According to Karel Hanzelka, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, but there are tens of thousands of fines that threaten no one.
According to him, the license is a document where people can decide whether or not to.
This is not a personal identity card, which must be valid for everyone.
Those who don't want to drive should cancel the license.
It's enough to take it to the right office or get it to the post office.
By the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers must gradually replace other types of licences.
Those with documents between 1994 and 2000 may be replaced for another three years.
The validity of licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire only in December 2013.
Hanselka says it's about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the fine of the co-founded detectives with Berdyccol.
Joseph Opava and Petr Koňačík, former police officers suspected of being co-ordinate with David Berdych's crime cooperative, were sentenced to thirteen and ten years of imprisonment.
This is the supreme court of Prague with a firm final effect, which thus reduced their punishments to one of them two years ago.
The Parchy Department's detectives were originally threatened by 14- and 12-year-old prisons.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, and the review can only be applied to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdychet is also suspected in the same case, he is only waiting for the first sentence.
In other proceedings, a total of 16 years have already been punished.
You can't have it anymore.
In January, the County Court found that 19 people were guilty of assaults, of which 16 have been discussed today by the Supreme Court.
Most of the defendants rejected the charges from the beginning of the investigation by refusing it to be a speculation case.
According to the Central-Czech Senate, following the agreement with Berdycchel, the police members have been providing information from police sources, covering each robbery attack, and helping the gang avoid criminal prosecution.
So the gang gave 30 percent of the robbery to Opav and Koňałík.
The case file is the crimes of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
First of all, we are talking about robbery victims who have suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of the authority of the civil servant and non-authorised armed forces.
Since police found illegal weapons held during house search, steel-based bullets, laser direction, or machine gun.
The gang is accused of looting ten million dollars.
In this case, the twenty-member gangs have already been declared legally guilty of other robberys by Berdych and many others.
Other members of the Berdych environment before the court even testify in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The first stage of the trial has so far been avoided by Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulej, who are in a preliminary arrest in Ireland, where they are waiting for a final decision on criminal proceedings for the Czech Republic.
Billing for child exchange: 12 million
For children who have been replaced in maternity, the lawyer of damaged families, Igor Veleba, from the hospital in Tâbíč, requires 12 million kroons of pain plus court expenses.
Three million each for mothers, two million for dads and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostal Veleba, essentially disagrees.
"We reject such a claim because it's too much," said Dostal after today's trial.
"We need an opinion on the counter-proposal, the expert opinion developed by the opponent.
We'll find out if there's any value that can be used at all.
But we maintain that it will be measurable in hundreds of thousands of people," Dostal stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns for every month, until he raised his own biological daughter.
Veleba served as a panel of experts on the basis of the compensation negotiations, prepared by the University Hospital of Motol in Prague.
Children’s parents, psychologists and psychiatrist experts, felt that they suffered from various degrees and depths of mental harm and stress.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even though they met with a lot of eye-to-face that they did not prevent the exchange of newborns.
Women are far worse off with the actuality of the trauma they've experienced and what's happening right now, they're putting the contents together with him.
Veronika and Nikolaa were replaced by nurses at the birth of Tâebíč on 9 December.
Last week, children returned to their blood-based parents - Nikola Čermák in Přibyslavic, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava to Trojanov in Jabloňov.
The head of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, at the end of October, gave families 100,000 crowns to replace their expenses, which were caused by the error of the hospital in tâbíčské, which was managed by the procedure.
All hospitals in Czech Republic have compulsory insurance from the provisions of the law.
In case of error, you must extend to the reserve fund, unless otherwise requested by the founder.
The courts so far granted relatively low compensation to the people, the amounts were calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand, exceptionally, of a few million kroon tables.
He lost his kingdom in Vésko.
Bolek Polívka lost his case for the title of the kingdom of Vésko.
According to the Ostrava walk court judge, although he first used the name of King Valchi, the project was developed by a team around Tomáš Harabish, who cooperated with the scenery.
Polvika didn't take part in the trial today.
However, according to the legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is that Mr. Harabish and his team are living in the popularity of Bolek Polívaka," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
He thinks the King of Valach is going to think of everyone as acting-commic.
This opinion is shared by Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Searching money and making up actions," he said.
He thinks the reason for the debate is money.
"In years they realized that the project could be successful and win something.
They want to live with our work," he added.
Future business
According to the court, the king of Valchi was first used in a television show in Polavika.
In 1993 Radoslav Brzobohatý was crowned.
At that time, however, this did not relate to the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing the passports for Valchi.
The original student action has become a business and profitable business activity, followed by Harabiš’s establishment of the society of the Kingdom of Vézasko.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to give its name and signature in passports and even their owners discounts when visiting its farm and theatre performances.
Who takes the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the idea, which Polvaka made available to the public in Manas.
"Boleslav Polívaka's popularity has certainly helped the project of the Kingdom of Valach," said the judge.
However, he added that the project was the spirit of Harabiš and its team.
The cooperation of today's united parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš Polvaka organised an official coronation in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the discussions between Polívka and Harabish have been accumulationd, which have been put to the rescue of King I. Boleslav for all time.
In the kingdom, the leading role of Harabish was taken over by Jarmila Šulakova as Queen of Mothers.
In 2002 he then filed a court action against Polívka Harabish and his associates, which the court refused today.
The battle designed by Harabish could bring light to the debate for the throne and the king's half.
This fight should be a new king.
He didn't want to tell you the details and the time.
"We don't want to catch anything.
This should be something like the Slovakko reign.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr. Polvavik can also come forward," added Harabish.
Tests 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot: Excellent prejudices
To be honest, I never liked Peugeot 206.
There are no special features of the past, no difference in the quality of the change, leadership and production can often be described as averages.
But its already present successor on the market, Peugeot 207 is significantly better.
And the combination called SW goes a little further, so I have no choice but to think more about it.
When I tested the 207 classic hatback of Peugeot, for example, I complained in the back seat to the head.
This time, the complaint is now over, as the combination's carisce means that the two meters of giants are no longer suffering in this regard.
Furgen in the World
In the inner square, I get through quickly so I don't repeat myself many times.
It's a relatively successful design with my only objection to the poor console.
I'd like to appreciate some more designer inventory here, if the car's outside is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained to the short lower seat or arms.
The lateral driving has also improved significantly in relation to the 206 model.
As far as space is concerned, there is also evidence of an increase in the bodywork size.
After the combination, the head disappears.
I'm gonna look in the trunk.
The main part of this vehicle is the parcel.
This is very well available (as well as thanks to the bent rear window) and a spacious blade.
The empty spaces are equipped with trunks, which are ideal compromises.
They're not on their way, they can be pulled apart, and they can handle harder things.
But let's just stay at the volume for a while.
On the basis of these tables, the fund is set at 428 l, which is rather an average value than competition.
However, in Czech Republic it is not the most sought vehicle of this class - the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the product of the new generation of mlada boleslav, then we find that Peugeot remains well behind many 52 litres.
This value is already almost critical when you place a foreign holiday or a baby car.
But if I have to highlight the positives, then I have to mention almost completely straight flooring after the second row backs off or the very low threshold.
120 halves in four rows
The car we tested was fitted with a four-wheel motor with an electric power of 1.6 l, 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is how you should look like the thousand-six hundred who runs the family hatback.
Quiet, small consumption, and pull primarily.
If you compare it to Škoda's fit, which often affects you like you've put a rag in your exhaust, that's all I'm happy about.
The price of the smoke
Car prices are not cheap.
We must remember, however, that we tested a car equipped with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The car leaves for 329 900 Kč with four cylinder alien motors.
The car starts with 410 990 Kč, which is enough.
The tested Premium equipment is to be discarded by another 80,000 Kč.
But even our headbags, automatic climates, automatic window wipers, rear windows, we also had electric remote control...
So the car costs 531 900 Kč.
This is many, but calculates the additional equipment of Fabia and gets a very similar result.
So there's nothing left but a brand-side decision.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is difficult.
In British schools, there is an increasing number of Eastern European children who are concerned about the further development of local school affairs by local people.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is now subject to a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases of violence between the children of immigrants and domestic residents.
The problems related to the integration of children from Eastern Europe show a situation in northern China, where there is an increase in the debate between immigrants and Slovaks.
Fighting between students and bonding are also a feature of parenting.
The situation so far is that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who said a ten-year-old student with a hammer.
The culprit protects him by insulting him with racist secrets.
The police had to act after two twelve-year-old girls attacked Slovakian immigrants.
The girls claimed to be the man with racist comments and threw stones at him.
"When we were on our way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop doing this, he hit us with apples and circulars, then exposed the naked back," said the mother of Slovak students, the new unpleasant case for The Times.
Both sides have complaints.
One local resident declared the debate on Eastern European immigrants as a survival struggle.
The above mentioned cases suggest that in British schools, the atmosphere between locals and immigrants is becoming tense.
In Great Britain, there are 70,000 Slovaks looking for jobs.
About 30,000 Slovak students go to British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean region
For visitors, freedom is indeed an island.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can be fulfilled if you choose correctly.
The gold and white shores, high waves, or sea, are calm as a fish.
Phalm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or amorous cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean, you can find this in full and even more rich lists.
On an island, however, you can find much more, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antillaks.
Under the Spanishs, Cuba was the rosary of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place human eyes have ever seen.
Havana became a treasure store and a transhipment horse, which was kidnapped and transported to Europe by the Spaniards in America.
Then the American era followed.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the bosss of the American Mafia, built because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (most of all), was welcomed in Cuba and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
There were guests, for example,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, towers were built, and on the broad roads, motor vehicles became a symbol of the culture of the past 50 years.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and he had his own yacht in Cojímar.
The Bodeguita del Medio walls are decorated with the signatures of the American show business stars and politicians.
What about today?
You can supply the wall of the Bodeguita in Havana with your handkerchief.
The expensive Nacional Hotel bar has a cocktail for you.
And the cars of the 50's cult travel to Havana until today, because the once exported gangl and the boys in these salty and wet airs have long since perished.
Although the oldest part of Havana is significantly leprosy, there is no such beautiful colonial monument anywhere else around the area as there is.
Other places are more beautiful than Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides the necessary money, its development received a green road.
New hotels were built not only in Havana in the last fifteen years, but also in Varader, on the coast of the Province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers a unique taste in the world, which is appreciated primarily by train fans.
From their expanded plantations, sugar cane was delivered to sugar plants by steam and motor trains.
Their motor park has not been renewed for decades, so the machines there are visible, which are now only visible in museums.
Where do we go?
Most of the best known places to visit Cuba are not avoided.
So we don't have to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should remind you that there is a museum on the already mentioned Hemingway Birts and who likes the writer not to miss the visit of this museum.
One of the most picturesque parts of the Viňales Valley Cuba is the western part of the island.
The stupid vegetation is growing from a massacre.
There is a steep rise in grass formations, locusts and rocks from the bottom of the valley and in their branches of soils, which can also cover the broken edges of a dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where maybe the best quality Cuban tobacco is produced.
Its final form may meet at the time of visit to one of the establishments in Havana’s cigar production.
Some may find it interesting that Major Zeman's episode was set there.
Trinidad
An ancient town founded shortly after the island colonization of the Spanishs.
It brought fame and glory to the slave and sugar trade.
The economy is a body filled with the beauty and monumental nature of a non-great city.
The subsequent French settlers had no change in their Spanish architecture significantly affected during the four centuries.
The place between Escambray plains and the sea is so misleading that even in the 50s of the past century, there were no roads that would have connected this country to the rest of the country.
A certain isolation helped him to remain outside.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't tear me down, everyone was glad to have a roof over his head.
If you have more time for Trinidad than a afternoon, it will be worth looking at the interesting places around you like the coast of Playa Ancón or the valley of the Sugar Fairs.
And tonight, it's fine to go to Casa de la Música, which after darkening, is where the music is quiet only by morning.
Baracoa
Some of the cities in the eastern part of Cuba are considered the most beautiful city.
Surely this opinion has already been influenced by the road itself.
Both of them have to overcome high and reared mountains, which are almost barely affected by human activity.
Cuba’s eastern land language was added to the World Heritage List thanks to the unpatriated nature there.
The best chocolate is made here, the church has a cross of Columbus (in reality after the boating of Columbus) and the hill, where the former castle stood and today the El Castillo Hotel stands, some of which are the best known for El Yunque.
The coffee, rum, cigars, the plainness of Sierra Metro, the Disson Bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Cabar of Tropicana, the sanctuary of Caridad del Cobra, Santeria, African religion, which can be written by the successors of the former slaves.
The way they say it is better to see it once.
The Afghan allies are passive, claiming the Americans
Few soldiers and lack of equipment are also affected by the progress of the United States Mission in Afghanistan.
According to Robert Gates, NATO should outline concrete plans for the next few years.
The Afghanistan mission does not seem to be taking place, and the leaders of the countries in Scotland with units in the southern part of the country have agreed.
In addition to the increasing resistance of the Taliban movement, eight participating countries are also discussing further plans and coordination of allies.
While the US Secretary of Defence Robert Gates has been called for greater activity this week, NATO troops are considered to be the primary priority for strengthening the Afghan government and strengthening development aid.
"Afghan development can be felt, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other allowed the population to start further development of the economy and security," said Des Browne, British Minister of Defence, to the BBC.
Ninety-nine percent
The Afghan risers' activity is reported to be the strongest in the last five years.
The number of acts of violence increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, and in the southern province of Helmand by 60 per cent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, approximately one quarter in the south.
According to the United States, however, allies have also reached their borders in the organisation and equipment of the teams.
In particular, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts have been asked to train Afghan troops.
"We have to think hard about concrete goals for the future and how to achieve them," řekl Gates.
He spoke in a similar spirit today to Jaap de Hoop, the Secretary General of NATO.
"I'm not happy about what's going on in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
About ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's not enough," said the Reuters news agency De Hoop at the end of the three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Out passive
In recent months, there are also discussions between the participating countries on whether all all the allies will offer the maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany was criticised for, for example, his pastiation.
"The Germans are present in Afghanistan with relatively large numbers.
However, they were put in places where the least of the violence and fighting requirements were so not as high as they were against us in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
Sun's British bullock called German soldiers lazy this week.
"Afghan sunsets have been discovered: The Germans will play until our sons fight," wrote Sun in a material supplemented by German soldiers playing tennis.
The German Bild attacked me and published a photo of the British team in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt reaches the one billion in 2009
All Czechs have 84,000 kroons of government debt.
The total debt reached an interest rate of 842.7 billion by the end of September.
This year, the government plans to raise a loan of EUR 159.2 billion.
By early December, however, the Ministry reduced this plan with an increase of 152.8 billion, thanks to a better development of the public budget.
At the end of September, the Czech Republic’s sovereign debt reached the interest rate of 842.7 billion.
During this year's nine months ago, this increased by 40,2 billion.
From June, however, it was reduced by $13.4 billion.
Thus today, the Ministry of Finance has verified the state debt data from early October.
All Czechs owe more than 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the state owes more than 11 billion dollars.
"For now, thanks to the lower deficit next year, the limit of the unillion crown will only be exceeded in 2009.
In the following year, debt will move around 900 billion and one trillion crowns," said IHNed.cz server's Analyst of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, you can see this Next Finance analyst, Vladimír Pikora: "We can cross the course of 2009.
That exactly when, for now, it depends on the next budget that is unknown.
If it proved to be a change in the policy field, politicians would be ready to come back more, and that could take place by 2010.
But I don't assume that change," he mentioned.
Increased debt
Government debt is the central government's debt, which is primarily formed by the accumulation of government deficits.
The State debt is financed by cash note, government bonds, direct loans, or by loans from the European Investment Bank, for example.
This year, the state's internal debt increase has now increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion.
The state's foreign debt has so far increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion.
By the end of September, the so-called State debt to be sold decreased by 803.3 billion and from June to June by 13.7 billion.
The average maturity of public debt rose to 6.5 years.
"The total year-on-year debt has risen by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is indeed enough compared to the progress of the economy.
It is interesting that the rise is generated primarily in loan bonds, where the rise is 20 percent.
The bad thing is that debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows what it will be to trade if there will be a pension reform here," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than waiting
The financing strategy and the government debt management in 2007 show that the government planned to raise loans of EUR 159,2 billion this year.
By early December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan with an increase of 152.8 billion, thanks to a better development of the state budget.
The amount is primarily the deficit of the public budget, which is likely to reach an amount of EUR 91.3 billion this year instead of the estimated amount of $76 billion.
Moreover, the proposed maximum amount of EUR 13,3 billion for the Czech Consolidation Agency, the ten billion reserve for pensions, the financing of public bonds of EUR 43 billion and the cancellation of loans of EUR 1,8 billion from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher shows up today in a cartel court for a name called a plysmack.
On Thursday night, a cartel court sentenced the British teacher to 15 days in prison and the country for the violation of Islam - his lawyer told him.
The British woman was accused of allowing her students from six to seven years of age to name a plysmacko to Mohammed. However, Islam’s religion prohibits the illustration of the prophet of any kind.
Such an act is punishable by coercion.
The 54-year-old British woman who was arrested at her own home on Sunday at the Unity High School in Karúm, who was accused of a violation and rebellion of Islam, based on paragraph 125 of the Sudann Criminal Code, after several complaints were made against her parents at the Sudann Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her students from six to seven years old to choose a name for the class's plysmack.
"The children offered a total of eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, with a vote of 23 out of 20, 20 were chosen by Mohammed's first name.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but also a very common first name in Sudan.
The kids then made a joint diary with the camera photo and the sign "My name is Mohammed."
The problem is that the illustration of the Prophet's universe is a violation of Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' colleagues at the same school told me that he knew him well, and that the teacher would never do anything that would violate any religious belief. He said it was just a "unfortunate error": "I'm only sorry that he voted with the children."
Many students of the teacher agree with that opinion, they say the teacher is "very good with children" and "if he doesn't speak about religion in the class".
Let us not forget that Mohammed is also the second most popular Christian name in Great Britain, and 14 different writing methods exist in English.
This last name chosen by Muslim families is one of the ways in which respect for the prophet is expressed. (Gyakran receives this name from the first child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of the first name?
Can you get this name, for example, in a game?
It's obviously a matter of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province of Wednesday's last Vienna trial.
End result: failure.
The sixth and last meeting on the future status of the separatist province in Baden in Austria ended without convergence of positions.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not reached agreement on the status," said Wolfgang Ischinger's EU diploma at a press conference in Vienna.
The American Ambassador, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was a "crowd of peace" and encouraged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises of peace and dialogue even after the negotiations.
"It does not have to be kept from violence in the near future, but it is a very difficult time," he added, stressing the existence of "serious tensions".
End of Mediation on December 10
On Monday, the last time you visit Serbia and Kosovo is the intermediary troika involving the European Union, the United States of America and Russia.
The future of Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian broker Aleksandr Bocan-Harchenko may be clarified by 90 per cent as he submits his report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, has announced the sixth and last meeting of the negotiations since the UN gave its troika a new broadcast in August last year.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation mission will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already failed Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, continue to negotiate after the deadline.
"Russia was committed, and that remains the negotiated solution, in addition to the compromise," said Bocan-Harchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After 8 years under the leadership of the UN, the Western authorities believe that independence under the supervision of the EU is the only viable solution.
Pristina stated that she was willing to unilaterally declare her independence if the Security Council did not decide for her benefit.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
"Sajnos has failed to reach agreement" - announced the president of the independent province of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu at the Baden hotel where "the negotiations of the last chance" have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo Resurrection and future prime minister of the province, expressed his regret.
He added, however, that Belgrade's idea of autonomy would be the continuation of a history of murder and deportation.
"Domino effect"
The Serbian President, Boris Tadic, felt that the compromise was still possible, and the majority of the Kosovo Albanians warned of the consequences of unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade is still in a unstable area due to the independence wars of the nineties.
"For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of compromise" said Tadic.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation again said that the decision should be the only Security Council in which the Russian ally has the right to vote.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word."
"For Serbia only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable" said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"The negotiations have been held for two years.
They must end in the same place as they started in the Security Council."
Fatmir Sejdiu said to journalists that "the last word of the Kosovo Parliament is going to be". He added that unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians is based on "conformity with the Western powers".
Bush urges agreement between Israel and Palestine
On Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israel and Palestine finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert and President of Palestine, Mahmúd Abbas agreed to open negotiations immediately between their peoples for 60 years.
Bush made a promise in the presence of the two presidents to support them in all possible ways to sign the Peace Agreement in 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must abandon the terrorist networks and Israel must abandon its colonizing activities - Bush said, and reminded the two parties of their obligations in relation to the peace strategy adopted in 2003.
The leader of the White House stressed that the objective of the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel was 'signing a peace treaty with which all the problem in question, including central issues'.
The latter concern three delicate problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestin debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation in Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees from their homes in the course of the 1948 conflict, who live in the territory of the state of Israel today.
Abbas, speaking after the American President, maintained that future negotiations would be "global and in-depth" and affect all areas of regulation, such as 'Jeruzalm, asylum, country borders, colonyes, water and security'.
After that, Olmert on the platform made a promise that future negotiations will be "public and continuous", and he will strive to "stop" them in 2008.
By the end of 2008, Bush set out the implementation of the "steam of two states" in Palestine and Israel.
Saudi Arabia declared that Bush had promised to do this before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (which has accounted for the success of an ad-Politic participation in Washington) has initiated a plan with the support of all the Arab countries that gives Israel peace in return for all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis "is an answer in the history of the Central East, especially because it is at the root of the problem and focuses on central issues", considers the Saúdi Prince in his interview with the Arabic newspaper of Saudi ownership.
The D.A. says the police aren't responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with such news, the official position and the rumor conflict.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first details of the investigation initiated by the National Police General Control Body (IGPN) on Sunday, after 17 minutes, a police car moved on to Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Beel.
"The car was on patrol, so he wasn't in action. He was 40-50 miles an hour without sirens," we found out from the police source.
The young "high speed" without two helmets was driven by a green "not included in the official register, so it cannot be used in road traffic" (see below) with Kawasaki branded engine.
"When they didn't keep the right-hand rule, the engine hit the left side of the police car," says a cop.
The alcohol test on the vehicle's passengers was negative.
It shows the strength of the impact that the front of the car was intruded, in the shape of the windshield, and the bumper was broken.
In his extraordinary announcement yesterday morning by Mr Pontoise's Attorney General, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, he said that IGPN and Val-D'Oise County Public Security Directorate had been entrusted with the investigation which was initiated 'for the failure to commit humanity and assistance'.
During the afternoon, the D.A. said at a press conference that the police's responsibility could be excluded at the current stage of IGPN's investigation.
According to the prosecutor, three witnesses of the accident heard on Sunday evening confirm "the police report that the bomber arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car".
On the day yesterday, a line, which, no doubt, the feet pulled on the road, has shown that the two vehicles were stuck and moved together for a while until the police car was able to cover it.
The vehicles have been reserved for technical testing.
The body of the two victims was subjected to the medical examination yesterday.
What happened right after that?
The rumor that the police quickly left the scene without providing help to the two young people was spread yesterday as a running fire.
In this respect, IGPN has a cautious definition, but it excludes the police from making "any serious mistake".
"This is the hardest part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation, and we have learned from the police source.
The Libération met a witness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of his windows looks exactly at the scene.
"My cousin, who is a hospital nurse, and we're about to go down and try to relive them," says the witness.
"There was nothing we could do."
And then he noticed "a cop who was completely disturbed and deranged.
The other two tried to relive one young man, and the fourth called."
Among those present, tension has increased, as the hopeless situation of the two youngsters has become apparent, so that the police officers with their car have removed their colleagues from the scene.
Also, we know from the witness's announcement that the ambulance "after the police left for about 20 minutes" arrived.
They used a heart massage, but in vain.
"I wouldn't say the police didn't try to help the young.
Young people did get help.
Firefighters arrived immediately at the scene.
They did everything they could to save them," she stressed.
Women's tension in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police prevented the first protests that General Musarraf introduced two days earlier.
According to witnesses, about two thousand lawyers in the eastern part of the country, the town of Lahore, were injured by tear gas bombs used by law enforcement forces.
In response, they threw stones at the police, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were produced.
Similar events took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and injured them.
Many persons have been produced.
In Islam, registered lawyers of the Supreme Court have called for a general strike and protests have been made regarding the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent assembly.
There were several demonstrations in Multan and Peshawar, the central part of the country.
Since Monday, he has encouraged the people to send flowers to the judges who do not agree with the necessity, and to trash those who have sworn before Musarraf."
"Musaraph's promise is no longer valid"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure notified on Saturday evening.
The Court of Justice must declare, in the days to come, the legality of the re-election of President Musarraf by a direct vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced by another.
"What we are witnesses of is illegal, constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court," said the President to the newspaper The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise that he would leave the army to fulfil the civilian presidential role was "lossed" after the emergency status was introduced - on Monday the Deputy Minister of Information, Tariq Azeem.
Musarraf had to deal with the military uniform until 15 November, i.e. his first presidential mandate.
The Deputy Minister for Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Government of Pakistan has, by the way, suffocated the entire country-wide rumor that President Musarraf would have designated an forced residence as Deputy General.
More than one third of pregnancy is not designed
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unplanned pregnancies.
Even today, more than one third (36%) of pregnancy is not planned - from the French National Institute of Demographics (Ined) study, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act which liberalises birth control.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unplanned pregnancies.
Ined estimates indicate that various methods of contraception such as the tablet or bee pill are still failure in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the Institute, the liberalisation of contraception has made the "on birth control" more effective. The study notes that only 5% of women aged 20 to 44 have taken birth control tablets in 1970, but now this ratio is 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancys are planned.
Every fifth is planning a few months with precision and, if possible, spring, because this is the most favorable season for the child to receive.
Visual improvement at the space station
Scott Parazynski's spaceship and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work for more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular improvement of the surfaced solar panels necessary for the scientific activities of the station.
This dangerous space story proved to be a record in many respects: the repair took a very long time, very little time to plan it, and the spaceships had to do it with "scapped" tools.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts separated from Discovery module. It is a giant cylinder-shaped element that will soon be the venue for European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see box).
This module is a kind of passage to the laboratory modules.
However, there is a need to take care of their power supply.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to transfer 17.5 tonnes of solar panels to the final location of one module producing electrical electricity, which was already on the ISS.
The crew then opened the 76 m wide solar panels of the module.
In this case, one of the two tables that could be folded in harmony was damaged by a fixed cable in a length of about 1 metre.
In order to avoid further injury, the table has not been opened.
The task of the astronauts was originally to take control of the Discovery Space Cycle and then to correct another misguided solar panels. Instead, they had to devote their full time to repair the damaged solar panels.
Scott Parazynski had the choice of hanging on a 30-metre robot arm attached to the station's crane.
He's one of NASA's best "space walkers."
He's tall, he's strong, he's very good, he's got a smooth upper body and he's got a long arm.
The 46-year-old doctor had to "operate" the "damaged" solar panel.
After carefully measuring the damage caused, he cut the wrong cable and fixed the damaged area with some "minors".
He also helped another "space walker", who stayed near the safe passage, as well as other astronauts, including the crew captain Peggy Whitson.
The tool used by him, a mini hockey robot, which was seen by insulation against hundreds of voltile tensions of solar panels, the spaceships of the station were five-pointed and "scrambled".
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until his companions opened the board completely, and only then he packed up his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts held a half-day rest, and today they returned to Discovery's space chlorine to begin their intended return to Wednesday.
The exchange rate of the EADS shares is limited
The price of EADS shares fell large on the Paris Stock Exchange after the company that produced aircraft and defence equipment announced that the development of A400M would result in an extra cost of EUR 1.2 to 1.4 billion.
The price of EADS shares is currently EUR 21,96 after a 4% decrease.
The company was forced to review its 2007 performance forecasts as the development of the A400M engine is delayed, which is why the aircraft's take-off will obviously be delayed.
The delay in the transfer of the combat transport aircraft, which was announced in October, will be between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion, will affect more than € 1 billion of Airbus', has been reported by the parent company of the European EADS manufacturing company.
As a result of these expenditures, the EADS will have to provide new plans for its operating result next Thursday, when it announced quarterly results, the company did not add any further figures.
The Group also indicated that the six-month delay was taken into account when preparing a new cost estimate.
In 2006, the EADS operating result decreased by 86%, mainly due to the delay in the development of another program, A380, which also caused a large financial burden to the company.
The company originally planned to transfer A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
Stay in status quo
Sunday elections do not promise a great deal of surprise: a large majority of Russians will vote for the Prime Minister of Putin, the One Russia.
In this Russian stability, his demand for self-governance is shown after a powerfully manned campaign.
Today, that is three days before the parliamentary elections, the Russian Head of State Vladimir Putin speaks in a television message to the electors, which has already been recorded, but the content is still secret.
Putin leads the Kremlt Support Party, a candidate for the Single Russia, which is expected to win a great victory in the elections.
At the reception of foreign ambassadors yesterday, the Heads of State did not say anything: he only took another run-up against the interventions of the Western countries, which was the subject of the campaign.
"We know what the price is for true democracy, so we want to have an honest, absolute transparent and open election, without any violation".
However, the opposition states that this situation is not up to date.
The opposition condemns the campaign, which they believe put pressure on the electors.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gennárij Zjuganov, claims that "this dirty choice in Russia wasn't even in the time of Jelcin".
Following last weekend's protests, former chess-world champion Garri Kaszparov was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized protests, and his lawyer claims that he was not allowed to continue to visit.
"The Russians are still thinking of "homo peupeticus"
The predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
Who's following Puttyin in the head of state?
The date of the first round of presidential elections was published in the Official Journal yesterday, which will be 2 March 2008, and candidates may indicate their intention of departure by 23 December 2008.
Since Vladimir Putyint was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate can no longer be extended.
But there's no other successor on the horizon.
What role does Putin play from March?
Are you going to be Prime Minister?
Or will he decide on the government and the President as a leader of the Almighty United Russia or the majority of Parliament?
Whatever happens, the outgoing power prevails both in Parliament and in the presidential elections.
This has now become a tradition.
"The Russians are still thinking about the way "homo peupeticus: they don't feel like they can control their fate" - believes Lev Gudkov's sociologist, director of the independent Levada Centre.
Nikolai Koposov, the historian of the University of Szentpetervár, goes even further: according to his theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later compared to Europe, so the development of civil society is delayed.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin went back to the paternist model, which was perfect for the people, but rather because this new kind of paternalism was not intimidating, but with certain economic well-being", says Maria Lipman, a member of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "responsiblely reject personal responsibility," which, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, quickly showed up.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all aspects of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite was interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of the United Russia are led by 65 governors who are removed from the leaders of the 85 Russian regions.
Freedom imported from the West is often the result of chaos, as was the case in the 1990s.
Public opinion favours stability.
In this spirit, the Russians will not vote for extreme parties.
Tamara Cserednicsko 54-year-old teacher concludes: "Why should we think?
Those in my power aren't so bad, why should we replace them?"
Repressive Memory
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive became public, documenting the fate of the 17th and half million victims of the religious regime.
The 47 million archives document, which contained 27 kilometres of bicycles in the Hessen Province, had so far been researched for the purpose of "humanitarian", i.e. they only provided individual and name-only insights for victims or descendants of the Hajdan region.
In May 2006, eleven countries, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, have agreed to open the archive for researchers and historians.
After all the States ratified the Convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen archive allows historians to carry out research on "the relocation of prisoners, the residents of camps and the health of forced workers", explains Reto Mastern, director of the archives held by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
To date, several states, including Germany, have opposed the disclosure of documents, as they contain names and thus confidential information.
Such may include the suspected homosexuality or mental disability of certain deported victims.
The purpose was to investigate citizens deported or sentenced to forced labour and possibly to serve with evidence of internaissance, on the basis of which they could receive compensation.
More than 300 permanent workers are currently involved in the processing of tens of thousands of specific needs in Bad Arolsen.
However, part of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of paramount importance.
"These documents are essentially nothing new," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of anti-semitic research centre at Berlin University of Technology in 2006.
EU and India would sign a free trade agreement in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade is already approaching €60 billion on an annual level.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the Free Trade Agreement in 2008 - said Peter Mandelson, European Trade Commissioner and Minister Kamal Nath Indian Trade Minister.
EU foreign ministers have already approved last April that the European Commission launch negotiations on the signing of free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of the Southern Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also India's main foreign investor, but India is only the 9th most important trading partner of the EU according to the figures of the European Commission.
Peter Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement could have an economic impact for both parties" and "India could thus increase its presence on a market with 450 million inhabitants".
The European Commissioner added to the ten most important products exported by India: the two giants, Europe and Asia each year 'EUR 47 billion' and 'EUR 10 billion' services - this week, Danièle Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New-Delhi. At the same time, he expressed his regret for the fact that bilateral trade was not always full potential. The EU and India will meet in Friday, New-Delhi in the context of the eighth diplomatic summit in Manmohanh and José Manuel Durao Barroso, the President of the European Commission.

Answers to the concerns: Bank of England proposes 10 billion pounds for the financial market for five weeks
The Bank of England wants to alleviate the anxiety about credit claims, so on Thursday, it announced that it would pump 10 billion English pounds into the money market, which would make it available with 5,75% base margin and, unlike usual, five weeks of futures.
"We want to overcome the concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we would like banks to plan for a more secure liquidity position for this period. Therefore, a significant part of the Bank's reserves will be available on the international financial market from 6 December to 6 December".
According to the bank, it costs 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) on the market at 12:15 p.m. on 6 December, local time. The offer is valid for the central bank and the repayment deadline is 10 January.
This is the first time that the Bank of England has issued liquid funds for five weeks in the context of an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In the Bank of England press release, he added that "supervised additional measures" in order to adapt the interbank loans to the bank's basic interest rate.
The current interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has exceeded the level of 18 September: currently stands at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the summer financial market crisis, the Bank of England has received significant criminal interest on the money market, which has alarmed banks from taking them.
According to the debate (which only strengthens the exchange rate of font compared to the euro), many people would have preferred the funds offered by the European Central Bank, which would have been more favourable to interest and greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre were blocked from discussing the socialist draft law on purchasing power, which is equivalent to the refusal of the text itself.
The text initiated by the Socialists at the meeting contained about ten measures adopted by the National Office of the Socialist Party on Tuesday, for example, the increase in the employment allowance of 50%, the recovery of the variable fuel tax, the introduction of a travel check and the restrictions on renting.
As the UMP and the NC 180:115 voted against the examination of the articles, the debate between the Government Party and the opposition on sometimes sharp change of speech ended at the end, only a few hours before the television talk of President Nicolas Sarkozy's purchasing power.
Jean-Marc Ayrat announced that he would resubmit all of his proposals in the context of the amendment of the draft amending Financial Regulation, which will take place next week on the agenda of the National Assembly.
A new festival will be launched
A number of rumors were raised about the new festival in Philadelphia by the C3 Presents. However, now the organisation and promotional company of the event announced that Melvin Benn, in cooperation with the British producer, will be held in New Jersey in cooperation with the Festival Republic.
"It is an honor to be able to work with someone who is the founder of today's American festival movement," said Billboard.com Charlie Jones from C3.
C3 also organises the Lolpalooza Festival in Chicago and the Music Festival of Austin City Limited.
The Vineland festival in New Jersey will be held in summer, so there will be a way to serve.
The festival will be held in a 500-metre private area located from Philadelphia for about 40 minutes from August 8 to 10.
The director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, known as Mean Fidler, is one of the world's greatest honours for the festival.
In 1989, he started organising the British Reading Festival, which attracts about 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn continued to expand his song with Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Festival Republic called the Latitude Festival in Suffolki Henham Park.
Melvin Benn has been a co-owner in the production, licensing and organisation tasks of the Glastonbury Festival since 2002.
He added that his company and Melvin Benn are working in parallel to the region’s wealth with a European-style festival.
"We've already chosen the location in Philadelphia, and with the Fairmount Parks Committee, we worked hard to organize this festival in the centre of Philadelphia" - said Charlie Jones.
"We continued to engage with the city, and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, because of the political manors of the city, the organization has failed," Charlie Jones continued.
"We were able to talk about this with Melvin Benn, and we are now preparing for a huge festival at another unique location, which will ultimately serve the interests of the inhabitants of Philadelphia."
The C3 Presents re-elected the Lolapalooza Festival in Chicago Grant Park in 2005 after demonstrating its extraordinary festival talent with the Austin City Limited Music Festival in 2002.
The gross income of the two events in 2007 was 9.8 million and 11.3 million dollars.
Both festivals were held at a city site.
"Melvin Benn's European concept is based on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some ways, and thus create both the European rural atmosphere and the urban perception of life in America."
Vineland lies about half a distance between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The people of Vienna, and even the mayor himself, are keen to support the event," says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not talk about the details of the agreement, he points out that "the conditions are positive enough to allow investment in such an event at an location that is hopefully to give a long time to the festival".
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be of an "timely" size, with approximately 80 000 participants in the Bonnaro Music Festival in Tennesse.
The band has already received an invitation to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
"Vineland is basically a rock festival, but we're planning a variety of musical offers to everyone to find what they want," says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, make up the C3 company that received the most recent Billboard Touring Award recognition from the "best independent event planner".
Montreal Faces with Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to deal with the Terminator...
"Walking" is one of the tasks of the Montreali.
The mission is "politically difficult" because the California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is opposed to filming his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight the "Terminator Governor"?
"We have to be careful, because the film industry itself decides which is the best spot for it.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, you'll go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions on the basis of which they stand next to us," says Schwarzenegger.
A Network for Festivals
Denise Turcotte, however, is now the focus of promoting Canadian films.
The competition for Oscars has begun.
The aim is to present and promote more Quebec films in every American film festival, whether it is the Sundance Film Festival or the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
The L'Âge des énèbres film received a positive reception a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, Palm Springs will be drawn at the International Festival.
Shakespeare Hands with the Devil is also presented in Santa Monica and in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
Quebec also represented itself with four short films and four toys this month at the American Film Institute Fest event.
Will the end of the year be the rally on the stock market? The experts' opinion is shared by the "subprime" problem
It is only five weeks before the end of the financial year that investors already rub their hands and look forward to the end of the normal year.
This year, however, it is not clear to experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, "from a static point of view, the stock exchange usually behaves positively in December.
However, only statistical background forecasts are not necessarily correct, and even, in the current situation there is uncertainty about the market, at least in the short term."
Experts do not argue that the stock market is "responsible for liquidity" at the end of the stock exchange year, although it is said that "the stock market is maintained, this is an opportunity for investment, because there are no alternatives to the guarantee, especially the fixed yield, which has negative effects on quality securities, as long as in the short term".
They therefore believe that the stock exchange will be characterised by a lateral movement that is not free of volatility, "especially since the effects of the Fed-kamatala reduction are not yet known, the price of crude oil is high and also threatens inflationary tension".
Javier Barrio, who is responsible for selling BPI in Spain, agrees with this, which means it would also be risky to say that there will be a rally.
According to the expert, "the situation is untraceable at all".
The loss of Ibex is close to 4 per cent compared to the highest values registered on 8 November when the index was closed at 15.945,7 points.
Despite all this, not all experts are so glamorous.
According to Juan Solana, Ibex 35 can close the year closer to 16.000 because of the restructure of the wallets and contributions to the normal pension fund.
On the other hand, the expert adds that there is a change expected this year, as it will be pushed to the next week after the long weekend of the Constitutional Festival.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, the Inversis Banco analyst, we are close to the technical level and "we have seen a fall in the stock exchange index, which may rise depending on the news from the US, as regards the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst believes they'll be positive.
Analysts agree on what will be the securities aimed at reaching Ibex's new maximum allocations.
Solana, from Intermoney, stressed that "this year, the big securities are in line".
The expert would add two large banks and some construction companies to the list, "as the electricity sector will be very expensive by now".
Federico Olucha states from Inversis Banco that the rise is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
Rally can also be positive for construction companies, of course, if any.
"ACS has been trying to recover its positions for several months and we hope that Ferroval and the FCC construction companies will follow this path," says the expert.
Cycle consumption will be the main factor in the remaining part of the year due to the increase in sales during Christmas sales.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies can also do well, although the representation in the Spanish market in this area is not too high.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, there has been a December exchange rate on only two occasions.
The real-year-end rally was observed in 2003, when stock market came out of the crisis caused by the breakdown of technology bubbles.
This year, when Ibex corrected 35 28.17 percent, a 668% jump was registered in December.
So it's still open to see if 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profit year (i.e. Ibex 8,36% increase since January) and whether the end-of-life Rally could occur.
Banco Popular Español opens a drawer open for 12 hours from 200 Mondays to Saturdays
Banco Popular Español has decided to reinstate most of his accounts.
This concerns a total of 200 branches in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the popular Max name and bring a big change to the bank.
But also for other Spanish institutions, since this is the first group whose accounts continue to be open until 20:30 in the same way, even on Saturdays from 10 to 20:30 at the latest.
The other group, BBVA, has also repeatedly stated that its accounts are planning an extended opening, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
But he's about to make a deal with the unions to close up 75% of his accounts in exchange for an afternoon, although not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for other institutions, as they will decide on whether to join a more favourable business opening initiative.
This is the objective of the Banco Popular Español project.
In these places, I would like to target individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local businesses.
Spain wishes to operate its 200 branches throughout Spain for 18 months with the above mentioned opening, because it is not a new opening order, but an existing transformation.
For this purpose, the institution modernises its branches in commercial zones according to the needs of the customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening time is accompanied by a new way of thinking about the nature of the accounts, a more modern, more colourful design.
The responsibility of commercial banks, Mr Rivera, points out that there is no need for large investment for restructuring, but they need to employ more employees, which means eight or nine employees per account instead of the current six.
These accounts, where even SMEs have been set up, will not sell financial products.
Fabulous Experience
In the three Madrid branches of Banco Popular Español, the initiative has already been implemented.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experiences were positive.
The branches in the streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía had a choice, and Rivero said that the decision was correct.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2.500 branches.
More 60 works under the name Mundocredit, specializes in immigrants and also has very favourable opening arrangements, even on Sundays and holidays.
In the units mentioned in PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our clients," says Rivero.
At the moment, mobile phones will be sold by means of Telefónica’s agreement and external personnel.
Telecinco first doubles its rival value, Antena 3 exchange
"We did it."
This sentence expressed the satisfaction of Paolo Vasile, the dedicated consultant of Telecinco at the closing of the market yesterday, when it turned out that the TV operator, who led it, doubled the value of Antena 3.
But one thing he's been enchanted by his joy: "Only the pain is that it's not because we've risen more, but because we've fallen less," he said.
He even stressed that in the weak market, we were "less".
Telecinco closed with a 2.54 percent boost yesterday.
This increase puts the annual loss at 15.66 per cent.
52 per cent of the company's Mediaset, 13 per cent of Vocento's, thus the stock exchange value according to Bloomberg's data is 4.488.88 million euros.
Rivalá, Antena lost 1.52 percent yesterday and has been able to book 40,5 percent loss since January, so that half yesterday was worth 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other rated communication companies is 3.571 million for Sogecable; Pisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) is 2.515.33 million for Prisa and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, comparison with Antena 3 can be attributed to similarity between the two companies.
The only question is how much we can do on the same market, what costs, and how does it turn out in the field of vision.
Telecinco announced last week that this year he wanted to be the first TV channel over the gross 1 billion commercials, said Giuseppe Tringali, Consultant of Telecinco and Publiespaña, a subsidiary of this group's advertising business.
If the notified fact were to be found, compared to 965.4 million recorded in the 2006 financial year, the TV channel would increase its revenues by 3.6 percent this year.
Net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the financial year (so reached 734.4 million), while net sales of television increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
According to the analysts, one of the factors that triggered Telecinco's stock market momentum is the high pay out which has so far been held: 100% of the company's share of the profits of President Alejandro Echevarría in 2006.
According to Vasile - although it would be too soon to decide - this ratio could change after taking 33% of Endemol with its parent company, coupled with Mediaset.
"We ensure that we pay the minimum of 50%, although we always split a lot more.
I hope our shareholders will be pleased this year, because we have already benefited from the acquisition of 33% of Endemol."
Analysts say that the market is currently characterised by a certain fall.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its return estimates for Telecinco by 4 and 7 per cent in 2008.
It is said that the estimated increase in sales from 10,5 per cent in 2008 to 8,4 per cent in 2009 and from 5,5 per cent in 2009 to 5,1 per cent.
According to the same company’s projections, Antena 3’s profits in 2008 fall by 4.5 per cent and 7,5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both securities, mainly due to high tenabilities and long-term sustainable potential from the dividends.
2.
Caja Madrid sees Telecinco as more favourable (sale) than Antena 3 (maintenance) because of its "multiple charm" and business strengthening.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends underweighting due to "risks comparable" (i.e. full market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves the receipt of MiFID which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel to Parliament's case, which has now been closed by the Congress vote approving the amendments to the Senate, the government has initiated a social dialogue on the legislation on which the law is based so that both of them can enter into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of various groups have consistently highlighted the efforts made by representatives and senators in negotiations and agreements to develop the most favourable normative investor protection and to regulate the activities of companies in order to ensure efficient market functioning.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, allows for the modernisation of financial markets, but at the same time strengthens investor protection, broadens the supervision rights of the Spanish National Securities Market Committee (CNV) and promotes cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new Director will allow financial advisory services to be provided to specialised companies, but also natural or legal persons, as well as to securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, to establish a new form of financial service provider (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFI).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems capable of carrying out operations involving funds, thus adding to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading platforms and mandates internalisation schemes that compete with current stock exchangers.
Furthermore, the Law obliges investment firms to keep records of all operations carried out to facilitate market information as regards the specific aspects, risk-taking and risk management of their business profile and the control of CNMV.
The Committee on Economic Affairs of Congress has introduced a number of amendments. Among these, it is of great importance that the securities are treated as a "complex" currency, due to the high risk for the investor, which has been identified in connection with high-risk mortgage lending in the US (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of its action was also used to establish legally the scope of the activities of those with economic and business qualifications, 30 years after the application of the Royal Regulation defining the professional functions that can be carried out exclusively by public traders in 1977.
And the Senate has proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as its intermediary agent, who is working on another account, does not need the authorisation of CNMV and can also sell products or acquire customers for several investors.
Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November to 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account for the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, shows the development of prices in Spain for the month of November.
The disclosure corresponds to Eurostat and the European Central Bank's strategy to provide data that can be compared with data from the United States, both in terms of their time and nature.
The reference figure shall be used for the same calculation method as for the calculation of the Harmonised Price Index, but the statistical modelling method differs from that used to estimate information that is not yet available at the moment of publication.
The Statistical Office has pointed out that the preliminary index is purely indicative and may therefore differ from the final data which will be published on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price Index continues to show relatively high values."
Pedro Solbes, one of the Vice-Presidents of the Government and the Minister for Economic Affairs, said that the rise in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November was only 'timeline', but, at the same time, indicated that the price index was expected to show 'relatively high' values in the coming months.
In Parliament's corridors, Solbes confirmed that "although the indicator is not very positive", the rate of inflation in Spain remained more or less the same in the monetary union in recent years.
He also added that the November month brought "less surprise" than the previous month, when the government did not account for such a great increase.
"We expected around 4 % of the value" was related to the data published by the Minister for Economic Affairs today.
The Northern Rock wants to reach 42 billion euros in Virginia over three years.
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% and are currently making only 12 billion pounds (16 billion EUR 800 million) since it was in the middle of September and had to take urgent credit from the Hungarian National Bank.
At that time, it had a record of more than EUR 25 billion deposit which gradually decreased over the past two and a half months due to the loss of confidence of customers, even though the Government promised a 100 % guarantee to the bank at the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial, commercial name, Virginia Money. Virgin will have to earn about one quarter of British bank revenues for the next three years to get the remaining 18 billion pounds and reach the 30 billion target.
Richard Branson’s group of highly respected businessmen, with its large advertising campaigns in England, is intended to spend some 50 million pounds (i.e. 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing so that they can reach the target.
Northern Rock made the offer of the Virginia consortium this week, rather than the most favourable to avoid bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana has been arrested for a suspected corruption case.
The Security has arrested the mayor of the city of Totana in the Murcia Province (Nep Party) this morning because they suspect that he was involved in the urban corruption scandal that took place this week.
In addition, he was arrested by a secretary of the City Hall and the city's chief of police.
The former member of the City Council, José Martínez Andreo, took over the place of the representative of the People's Party Juan Morales, who, according to the official bodies asked by the SER radio channel, could have been the head of the corruption network.
The police are still investigating the city's offices and the City Development Council, and no further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' lawyer was under investigation as the main suspect of the corruption scandal that came out this week.
According to information from the SER radio station, Juan Morales' lawyer was arrested when Morales was leaving her home with the documentation on corruption in her bag.
According to the police sources, the subject of the investigation is the supposed commission that Morales received in exchange for signing a urban development agreement with an Galicia building company on the transfer of 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepts the nomination of the PSOE in Toledo and the President of Parliament if they win the elections.
Former Minister of Defence, José Bono agreed to the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's offer to manage the PSOE's agenda for the next parliamentary elections and to fill Parliament's President's office if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by the PSOE's Secretary, José Blanci, at a press conference, and Bono himself confirmed the party at the Federal Center today after a meeting with Zapatero.
The Prime Minister explained his election to the former minister that "we have to count with the best" in politics, and Bono is " among the best".
In addition, he added that "i.e. a Manchai politician will be the candidate of the Socialist Party to the parliamentary office if the socialists win at the forthcoming elections.
Bono would take over the place of the current President of Parliament Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he would not intend to go to the next elections and give up his political career rather in scientific circles.
The former minister acknowledged that the Head of Government was constantly involved in returning to the scene of politics since he left active politics two years ago.
He also added that, since the electors were aware of who would be the Vice-President of the economy in the event of the socialist victory, the party would also like to inform them of who will be the President of Parliament.
If Bono really does fill in the post, he would like Parliament to 'be the scene of respect and not insulting or yelling' and to be more like the home of citizens.
"At times, unfortunately, Parliament seems to be the only place in Madrid, where it is not possible to talk alone, it has already been that the Prime Minister's speech has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate".
At the same time, he welcomed the current President, Manuel Marín, his 'good work', but he did not want to make himself a president, so that his opponents do not regard him as 'sufficient'.
A campaign for climate change
Since the movement promoting climate change is uncomplicatedly pursuing both sceptical behaviors against their forecasts and those who favour political or social battles must be very strong.
In fact, he has to put a political leader like Prime Minister Zapatero, who believes that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and announces that "we have to make a new deal with our Earth".
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which its government's activity or inactivity has contributed to the fact that Spain is in the interest of non-compliance with the Kyoto Convention within the Union.
Who are responsible for the failure to comply with the Convention, which sector is affected and why has the Government not sought to avoid this?
In addition, it should also clearly explain to the Spanish what measures they intend to take to address climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what practices do the population have to change, what individual and social energy saving needs to expect, and what economic consequences will this have?
So who needs to sacrifice and pay for saving our Earth?
But we didn't get it and we won't even get an explanation for these questions.
That's why we're talking about sacrifice and money.
Climate change has taken measures, actual measures are always unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and cost-effective for both companies and the general public.
Even the increase in PSOE’s petrol consumption would have meant a lack of popularity before the elections, so Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
That is, we must save the Earth by mere propaganda texts, with empty password free of real consequences.
Agreements, committees, protocols, new duties.
With the agreement with Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so nicely in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, and even build election meetings and tenderness in us.

They arrested the mayor and chief of police of Totana for a suspected corruption case.
The Authority arrested the mayor of Totana in Murca Province, Andreo of the People's Party, the local Commissioner, Secretary of the City Hall and a catering business operator for crimes related to urban development.
The mayor was arrested in his home, then transferred to the City Hall, he is currently present with several police officers, many of whom are being investigated by the City Development Council and by the municipal authorities responsible for the management of the Industrial Enterprises and Laks.
The three arrests were prevented last Monday by arresting six persons in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia in respect of a case where 2 hectares of land could be re-assembled to permit the establishment of 4000 homes for the Galicia company after unlawfully paid commissions at the time of their previous mandate.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation according to the information provided by the Totan Court of Justice No 1.
The first six people arrested were transferred to the court.
According to official sources, former mayor of Totana Juan Morales, who is now an independent parliamentary representative of the People's Party, is also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who is the owner of a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also examined as well as the former mayor's current girlfriend who lives in the centre of Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.The lawyer and contractor were arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra) together with the director of the Suelo de Inmonuar company, Pablo José M.G.
The investigation is carried out by a group of persons entrusted with crimes committed at the self-government level by the Military Central Unit, whose members were held outside the arrests, mainly in companies linked to arrests, operating in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, one person was arrested: the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the area, who could have been a mediator.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in Totana, with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company has obtained 2.2 million square meters of territory in Totana, which has been re-rated. The project would have doubled the population of the current 25 000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, Vigo in Vigo, Conycase, Hogartel specialising in direct marketing, and Preconiza, which is responsible for the management, promotion and construction of the building elements.

If you agree, we'll put a little aside the Book of the Day and see if we can acquire some philosophic knowledge and wisdom.
I already have one.
People, life is a constant change.
Of course, everyone can figure something out for you.

Our Finnish journalist found this comment in one of Finland's largest journals: (notably the world's level of culture at the head of the PISA report), referring to the criticism of Blackburn's book on November 18th.
" Philosophic teachings were brought before the public after the tragedy of Jokela High School.
The killer quoted Plato and Nietzsche's texts in messages from a pre-school student.
The Education Council, Pekka Elo, entrusted with the teaching of philosophy, demanded that teachers examine Plato's teachings with a critical eye and added that Nietzsche's knowledge is not necessarily important at the level of primary philosophy of secondary schools".

One of his colleagues informs us that the Punishment Code contains the offences related to online downloads:
A. Downloading a music number is considered a crime and can be punished for a year from six months.
However, if you steal a record of less than EUR 400 in a store, it is only an infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal EUR 1000 in a store, theft is already a misdemeanor, but its punishment still does not reach the level of penalties that can be imposed when you download the Internet (Article 234 of the BTK).
C. If you steal a car, but you take it back in 40 hours, the penalty still does not reach the level of penalties to be imposed when you download the Internet (Article 244.1).
D. You can count on a smaller penalty if you get into a fight than if you copy CDs.
If you are involved in a mass crash, you can receive a fine from three months to one year (Article 154 of the BTK), while the penalty for copying the CD is from six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the BTK).
According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as a DVD film download.
F. The marketing of copyright-protected films is more punishable without the contribution of authors than the sale of pornography materials to minors (Article 186).

My doctor gave me an article on strange research, entitled "The money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less of it".
So the feelings of the employees on the day they paid depend on how much the others got.
The experiment was carried out at the Bonnie University, by measuring the tomographs of magnetic resonants, and the results were published in Science's latest number.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and the head of the Neurokognition Group of the Institute for Life&Brain in Germany, "We measured the strongest activity when the participant replied correctly, but the partner was wrong".
Researchers found that if both were given the right answer and received the same money, brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received a double amount, the activity was increased.
I have no idea why this great science needed such a simple concoction.
Attorney-General of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been conducting the war crimes of the Balkans for eight years in the Hague, and the Criminal Court's office investigating crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.
His mandate is due at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a somewhat bitter mouthpiece, as the responsible for the bloodshed in Srebrenica, during which 8,000 Muslim Muslims in Bosnia were slaughtered, i.e. General Ratko Mladic and Chief of Bosnia-Herzegovina Radouvan Karajics are still on the loose.
Their names are on the list of Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach's documentary title: Carla's list (not yet presented in 2006 in Spain). Like true crime, the film follows the work of the Swiss Attorney General from Belgrade to New York as he tries to put pressure on the governments concerned to put the loop around the refugees.
What kind of insurance do I have?
Car insurance, which means safety for the owner of the car, is subject to significant costs in relation to the various damages and also to several factors, such as age, sex, date of acquisition of the licence, family status, type of car to be provided and type of use of the vehicle.
Buying a car is just a first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car we want.
First of all, we need to know what's going on.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured company.
This agreement has been concluded in the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company will pay compensation in the event of the damage in the head of the fixed premium.
The insurance fee is practically the amount paid for insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, date of acquisition of the licence, family status, type of car to be provided, use of it and others.
Insurance companies are setting the insurance fee on the basis of statistics, i.e. paying a higher amount than the person representing a higher risk of accidents.
That's why they're over 25 years old, or women pay less, because statistics say they're a lower risk because they're more careful.
Similarly, on the basis of the findings, insurance companies concluded that married people also cause fewer accidents than lonely people.
The frequency for the car type is the final one.
More frequent use increases the possibility of an accident.
When setting the premium, insurance companies will take into account a number of factors.
Therefore, the owner has to look carefully at its profile to choose the most appropriate form of insurance.
The following are the key factors for the choice to best adapt to the requirements provided and create an acceptable price.
At the time of conclusion of the insurance contract, people under the age of 25 have to count a number of backgrounds, such as lack of driving experience and freshness of the licence.
Although we are most ideal when we are at risk, there are more economical solutions.
The more careful leaders can make a complete insurance, and this will be secured against any danger, and the price will be affordable.
In such a type of contract, the insured person shall pay part of the damage.
"The amount of self-financing to be paid by the insured depends on the insurance fee; the higher the fee, the lower the cost, says Luis Nogue, the head of the online insurance intermediary First Europa in Spain.
Another option is the liability insurance extended to third parties when the client provides himself against the damage caused to others but not against damage caused to his own car.
Besides, there's gonna be a secure theft, a fireworks, and a car loss.
Good advice.
If you are not 25 years old, be careful and preferably avoid accidents because this has an effect on the bonus and you can therefore reduce the amounts to be paid in the future.
It is referred to as a bonus in relation to the base rate of the insurance company.
And we call the punishment for the basic tariff a mill.
"The amount of bonus and mill depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company had a good year, he could allow himself to raise the amount of bonus" explains Nogue.
Once they have crossed the 25-year-old limit, it is easier for owners to make adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced thanks to years of experience.
At that time, we advise you to make a full insurance with you.
"In Italy, young people are not yet able to apply their experience properly during an accident or even at the time of driving", says the director of the European insurance company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur during the second year of driving, when leaders have already exceeded the fear of beginners.
If the insured person is already married but has no children yet, it is best to make a full insurance, of course, if his financial options allow this.
Insurance companies are keeping children's couples at risk to clients, so in their case the fee to be paid is lower.
In this case, it is best to extend the insurance by self-preservation (this can reach EUR 300) or if you have a higher bonus, from the third year of the vehicle, to the damage caused to others.
"They drive more calmly, but at the same time they have greater customer power and they can allow themselves to have higher self-responsibility", strengthen Luis Nogue.
In the case of pensioners, we recommend complete insurance with a flat rate (around 150 euros) or extended to liability insurance in case of a higher bonus.
Car insurance is very important, not only because it means protection for the owner in the event of damage, but also because it means a high cost, so it is essential that we choose the personalised form of insurance properly.
He wants to get the Celtic point in Milan to get into the eighth final.
The Milan and the Celtic Tuesdays measure their strength together in the San Siro stadium to get the missing points when closing the League of Champions, and the Italians can be first, and the Scottishs can qualify themselves.
The Italians have a total of ten points, and already in the fifth round they have secured access to a tie with Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but one more is needed to ensure that the six-point Shakhtar who will fight with Benfica on the square.
Two games for Group D will be held one week before the sixth round, because Milan has to play in Japan at the Club World Championship, where on 13th, he is trying to fight the progress to the 16th final.
This group D will be closed sooner than the others, and although the most likely result in Giuseppe Meazza will be the final outcome, the two teams will seek to win, because the Italians do not want to stay home, and Celtic can start from the first place in the eighth final.
The defeat of Gordon Strachan's team is enough to qualify if Shakhtar wins, but you can't be sure about it, because if there's an equal point, the Ukrainians will be able to move on, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but they won the next match (2-0).
The Italians will try to overthrow the night of the Scottishs, who would like to be in the eighth finals of the newly formed League of Champions twice after they got out there in the previous season with a goal of the extension of the 0-0 tie (1-0 tie).
The Shakhtar victory of "Rossonerik" would be more likely to be the best, because if the Celtic loses in the eighth final and remains in the UEFA.
As Benfica, even though she is in the final position and is not able to remain in the European Championship, she can still get the third place with a victory to play in the UEFA.
Twenty thousand people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
The Spice Girls started their tour in Vancouver (Canada), the first time they've been out since 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Gerer Halliwell" before the concert organised at the vancover GM Place, they announced that the joint "remect form" was announced a few minutes before the concert.
Some 20,000 people switched tickets to be at the concert, where a video film has also been presented with great successes in the 1990s.
At the same time as the group's combination and tour, a new album was placed on the market in Spain by the EMI, where larger hits and two new songs include "Headlines" and " Voodoo".
Five members of the Spice Girls came on stage in a bracelet from the husband of "Posh Spice", British football player David Beckham.
The athlete was also on the field of view until the GM Place was knocked out, although a few days earlier Victoria told him not to do so.
At the time of the show, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "was not yet seen in our show, so I'm nervous about what you're going to think about the performance."
'Sporty Spice' was the reason why the band broke up two years after they left the band in 1998 'because the members didn't understand each other'. He also seemed nervous at the press conference that they held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings for Spice Girls changed.
I thought why not? Now I'm glad I decided to do that" said Chisholm about the band that broke up nine years earlier.
The singer also added that during the time "the things were settled and we love each other very much".
But there's been a lot of changes since Spice Girls took off in 1998.
The CTV TV reports that Virgin Airlines was on a special flight to Vancouver.
There was a bunch of baby-sitters waiting for them at the airport.
Five of them have seven children.
After the vancover concert, the team is in California (USA) and then in San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5, 7.)
Madrid will take their action on 23 December.
Another fear of the Russian-Ukraine gas dispute
The gas supply between Ukraine and Russia has been renewed, which may also affect Russian fuel to be delivered to Western Europe.
The majority of Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) are transferred through Ukraine and the discussions between the two nations have always been closely noted.
Kiev stated that if Moscow lifts the gas price to be paid by Ukrainians, they would also have a higher transit cost for Russia.
As a result of a previous debate between the two countries, supply to EU countries has been reduced.
The latest debate between Kiev and Moscow relates to the attempt by the Ukrainian Government and the Russian State-owned natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, the gas price paid by Ukraine to Russia in 2008.
The Gazprom stated that in the case of gas produced from neighbouring Turkmenistan, it should be increased by 50% compared to the price agreement with Ukraine for 2008.
According to the analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in prices for Ukraine from Gazprom.
"It is important to argue during the negotiations in accordance with one of the most important Member States of gas supply," said Anatolij Kinah Ukrainian Minister of Economic Affairs for the Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should certainly be linked to our debate on the level of the costs of transit through Ukraine (and the Western Europe)."
As a result of the most recent significant gas supply between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a dominant decrease in exports to Western Europe, which also greatly increased prices.
A quarter of the European Union's gas supply is the Russian gas.
Russia has the largest natural gas reserves in the world, but most of them are still undiscovered.
As a result, Gazprom’s own gas supply is complemented by natural gas from the Turkish and other Central Asian states.
NHS is committed to checking foreign workers
The Scottish NHS Committees should improve the monitoring of the criminal record of workers from outside Europe - a supervisory body said.
Robert Black has been proposed after a doctor of foreign nationality in Scotland was linked to the attack on the Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern about the fact that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of employees at sea.
At the same time, the report, through a sample of five health authorities, also pointed out key controls that were carried out properly.
Following an attack on the Glasgow airport, the Director-General has verified the list of staff recruited outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old Bilal Abdullah, a doctor of the Royal Alexandra Hospital, located in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep turned to the headquarters of the building.
Abdullah was one of the three doctors who were interviewed by the court of Old Bailey through a video link in October for attempted car bombings in the United Kingdom.
In the case of their staff from overseas countries, the NHS Committees shall verify the existence of the skills and experience of the workers concerned and the provision of authorisation for employment in the United Kingdom prior to the start of employment.
Although Scottish Health Committees are applying Disclusure Scotland for the purposes of verifying the criminal record, the Agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the United Kingdom.
The Director-General's report has, among other things, proposed that committees introduce the Code of Conduct of the Criminal Register Office, which facilitates monitoring processes with different overseas countries.
"Although we have found evidence of such checks in the staff records, they are not regularly carried out," the report states.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS performs its own pre-employment review procedure at a high level, adding: "Our report highlights the area of development of the system in order to have up-to-date information on the number of staff from NHS overseas."
Dr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, says that it is "unfortunately impossible" to identify potential NHS employees with the help of pre-employment checks.
"The report states that the checks that have been used for employment are working well in NHS Scotland and that the value of the proposals is not yet transparent".
According to the Scottish health authorities, most of their employees are 1161 people.
However, the Director-General pointed out that the numbers are likely to be higher, which can be explained in part by the fact that there is a problem for the committees to identify unaltered staff on leave.
The investigation has also shown that the control procedures introduced in the Ayrshire and Arran region, the Gramian, the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian are largely coordinated.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, employment permits and professional qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the Directive and guidance for checks and guidance on the employment of workers from NHS overseas countries.
Mr Sturgeon said: "I am very pleased that after the attack on the Glasgow airport, this task was carried out.
He added that, in cooperation with the Health Committees, the Scottish Government will take into account the proposals contained in the report and ensure that the updated guide on pre-employment checks, including those from overseas, is reflected in the best practice application. The updated version will be published in the following month.
Joy Division tarol at the movie award box
The bipic of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, was swept by five prizes at the British independent Film Award, among other things, for the best film.
He's got the title Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before Curtis was formed, and Anton Corbijn's director and Toby Kebbel.
The best actress award was won by Dame Judi Dench with the Thriller "The Details of A scandal."
And the Variety Prize - for setting the British film into international reflectors - was taken by Daniel Craig, who created Bond.
The prizes were awarded in connection with the celebration at Roundhouse London.
He shows Curtis's rise in the film "Control" in the Joy Division Worlds until 1980, when he committed suicide when he was 23 years old.
The production of "The Killers", David Bowie, as well as the black and white film "New Order on the soundtrack" cost only 3 million pounds.
The Dutch photographer Corbijn, who was previously known as the album director of the U2 "Joshua Tree", was rich with two prizes, with the best director and the best director.
Another award winner for the celebration placed rock music at the center; Julien Temple Joe Strummer, the singer of Clash, took the award for the best documentary film.
Viggo Mortensen has received the best actor award for the performance of London's Thriller of David Cronenberg, head of the "Gyly Promises" Mafia boss.
Ray Winstone, depressed from the hard guy's role, received the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The 50-year-old actor, whose name includes "Scum", "Sex-dog" and "Sex-dog" film, is currently involved in the film "The kingdom of Indian Jones and Crystal Cristle Cup".
Winston is proud to take over Camel and Harry Potter's death star, Harris, in 2002.
"For people like me, people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened up to him," said Winstone.
"I feel lucky to have met Richard Harris more than once.
Richard Harris' style is close to me, he was a great actor of his age, and I respect him very much."
The selection of independent film prizes known as Bifa is decided by a group of film directors, actors and festival organisers.
The bifa supporters and pathons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 people were arrested in Saudi Arabia for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia has announced yesterday that 208 militants were arrested in terrorist cells, who were planning a recent attack on an oil facility and the execution of several attacks on church and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one of the cells tried to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaida's supporters have launched a campaign against Monarchia, which has been an ally of the United States since the 2003 Iraqi invasion.
According to television reports, eight-person cells of foreign citizenship led by an Eastern Province to launch a planned attack on an oil establishment.
Following an attack attempt by Al-Qaida against the largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq worldwide, Saudi Arabia started to build a 35 000-person rapid response force to protect the facilities.
According to the report by the Minister of Home Affairs, 18 of the arresters are part of a cell led by an illegally crossing the country's borders.
The report also reported that the warriors tried to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom.
On 22 of those arrested, there were plans to commit attacks on church leaders and security forces.
The government called on the church leaders to cover up the sadists that join the Al-Qaida warriors, who are fighting against the federal forces and the U.S. supported ski Muslim government.
The warriors of Al-Qaida are considered to be a significant part of the church leaders of Saudi Arabia, as the authorities have involved in the policy of the royal family that governs the government.
The warriors of the organization - encouraged by the call to Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al-Kaida Saúdi, to target the Western African government - the attack on foreign residents, government buildings and energy installations.
"The security forces have made huge efforts in the last... five months," said a public television speaker at the Ministry of Interior.
During the arrests in Medina, a 16-person "media cell" was also captured, with the aim of spreading "takfiri thinking". Takfiri's thinking is the ideology of the sunnia Muslim radicals, which supports violence against the infidel and demised Muslims.
There were also 32 persons accused of financial support from the militants.
Venus climate can give you an overview of the Earth's future
According to scientists yesterday, Venus was once able to provide a pleasant living environment.
The data from a European cruise ship indicate that this planet is more regarded as the earth’s enchanting twin brother than we had previously believed.
Venus is the nearest planet's word on Earth.
The size of the two planets is almost the same and their orbit is similar, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Scientists now know that millions of years ago, Venus was able to rule a very similar living environment and even living conditions.
Due to its high carbon-glass effect, the atmospheric erosion caused by solar radiation and the smaller speed of the planet, Venus has moved into a far different development course.
Today, the water was distilled from the planet, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and hurricane winds and lightning storms are destroyed.
The findings of the European Space Agency Venus Express's space probe, based on a year's study of the planet, reflect a fascinating picture of how similar disastrous climate changes on Earth can develop.
Fred Taylor, professor of the Physics Department of Oxford University, who is also one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "Please tell me why Venus's climate is so different from that of Earth, even though the two planets are otherwise very similar.
"Our new data enabled us to develop a scenario on the development of Venus by billions of years ago when it could still have living conditions similar to Earth.
Police busy "roasted uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material - according to the reports of a degenerate uranium - was taken yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
According to a police speaker, three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The spokesperson did not confirm whether it was a enriched uranium, but stated that the material would have been sold for $1 million (480,000).
Open Gates Cut
According to Mitt Romney, it is not worthy of a candidate starting a presidential election to answer questions from a snowman.
However, the Republican candidates of the presidential election agreed to participate in a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded and forwarded their questions to candidates for video.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night of November 28 proved to be as ridiculous as the snowman who asked about global warming in his debate on the other party on YouTube.
However, these questions and answers have, on this occasion, well reflected the situation of the Republican party approaching the election next year.
For the time being, it is not known that CNN’s production leaders who co-financed the debate specifically selected YouTube’s clients.
The longest question of immigration was the question of the first half of the debate.
This is a topic for a Republican couple.
CNN asked some uncertain voters that if they had heard something glamorous, they would play a number: the intermediary was in agreement when the candidates expressed hardly about the issue of borders.
The most lively and longest debate was between Rudy Giuliani, a national-level debate, and Romney, which was the main priority in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giulian is trying to change the image of him that he has been too easy to deal with the issue of illegal immigration during his mayorship in New York.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants for the construction of his house by the former Massachusetts governor.
The word between you and your two has become particularly intense when you are interested in the support of the "amnestia" (which would provide illegal immigrants with the permanent status and the possibility of citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes - such as those from Duncan Hunter California and Tom Tancredo - have been able to get very deep on the subject.
And although none of them count as an opportunity on the mark, their stay on the race track may be explained by the fact that they started to conjure the bells of immigration more clearly than others.
At least there is broad agreement among candidates on immigration: strengthening borders and hard action against illegal immigrants.
This topic, like the fear of Chinese toxic games and other alarming factors from outside the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimise the division between liberals and Christian conservatives.
However, when other types of topics have been put forward, the debate is very unpleasant.
Giulian had to face the question of why he supported the arms control earlier.
John McCain and Romney debated the question of whether simulant water suffocation should be considered torture.
Another questioner was wondering if the candidates would believe all the words of the Bible.
In this issue, Giulian was botlading at the end of his mind that even though his favorite book views the Bible, Jonah and the whale, he might not literally understand.
Another question raised was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, the first place in the Iowa elections, who was just about to win, could have been responsible for Christian conservativeism, reacted to expectations that the death penalty was painful, but it needed it.
When he was accused that Jesus would receive sufficient support, he said, laughingly, that Jesus would be wiser than he would leave the elections.
Competition continues to be unusually open.
Huckabee's momentum in iowa coincides with the campaign of the liberal Ron Paul Paul and the enthusiasm that followed him during the Wednesday debate.
The sudden premise of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the parties have not yet been able to launch a joint candidate among the more well-known and more traditional Aspirans.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who had a timely and convincing conversation about the winning message of America's size and who found the joint voice with both wings of the party.
Now, however, the party is divided, and the consequences of this are not yet visible.
Working Party Pains
Another break in front of Gordon Brown; the way out is unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, the present one doesn't seem too pyreous.
No one sold his honor, no politician came up with the hotel accounts in Paris, no one made a scandal outside of marriage.
But finding that a rich businessman, under the name of others, has, for more than four years, contributed to a working party in Britain with more than 650 000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) and that he did not report this party, one of the things that had not been well covered by the surrounding Gordon Brown.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister got out of the election, and when he said that public opinion polls did not influence the outcome of the decision - he unscrupulously questioned the intellectual capacity of the British people, people were still hoping that Brown would ensure a strong and effective governance.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the Vice-President of the Liberal Democrats with increasingly spiritful remarks, has once become Mr. Bean.
The setback to rescue a narrow bank called Northern Rock has crossed regulatory weaknesses and shortcomings in judgment.
Patient proposals to change the tax law encouraged business interest groups to work together with the government.
The loss of 25 million people's personal data by the tax authority has unimaginably revealed a high level of administrative misdemeanor.
In the House of Lords, three-maned generals protested against the reduction in the army's budget, stating that the position of the Minister of Defence is part-time employment.
And here are David Abrahams' mysterious donations; Peter Watt, Secretary-General of the Labour Party (previously administrative leader) has already resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the way out.
At the same time, governments can reach the point after which governance is impossible.
People don't like politicians and they don't trust them, but when a new group goes to power, they usually stop their disbelief.
As it becomes clear, however, that the Prime Minister is unlikely to be able to do things for a long time, and perhaps it will not remain on his post, the end of the suspension of disbelief: the civil servants' arm will start to leak, the office ministers will look after bad news; and the government will start to defend and be unable to concentrate.
In some respects, Brown is in a particularly difficult situation because, unlike other political leaders, he does not count as "fresh blood".
As much as you'd like to deny Tony Blair's relationship, he still had his right hand.
The problems surrounding Northern Rock and the tax authorities record, for example, relate to decisions made during Brown's Finance Ministry.
And although the link between Blair's misguided actions - such as the long-term analysis of the "monetary gender" case and the political party funding - was not directly involved, voters could rightly assume the opposite.
Although Brown's situation is very unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it looks.
Precautions made are not as scary as their throats indicate.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was taken directly.
And compensation - whatever pain it takes - can always create the trends that Stalin living in Brown: reliable, solid and slightly hard-handed governance.
For example, the cool around political donation is a good example.
The Garboian cell Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, declared that he did not want to publish his good deed.
Perhaps so, the decision to make was not his responsibility.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of large political supporters is clear and clear: the population has the right to know who is knocking at the door of the leaders of the country.
Watt, who, according to his own statement, knew about Abrahams’ action, but was not aware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweating during the interrogations; just as Jon Medleson, the foundation director of the Labour Party, who was informed in October of the confusing donations.
And to Brown, for now, the fibres do not lead: there is no indication that he knew about these rolls, even that the huge amounts were paid after Brown's entry into the office of June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half his job.
The violation of his party's law was soon condemned, but his strength was increased to a familiar instrument; by investigating the case, in the interests of security, he entrusted a committee with the leadership of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this story, the lesson to be taught isn't too complicated.
In the event of an infringement, the police are competent.
In addition, Brown needs to take other things, such as the appointment of the President of the independent committee on administrative rules, which is not in charge of six months ago, or the prioritisation of the effective reform of political party funding.
This would require cooperation from the hard fishing party at Work with stories and breaking up with special financial relations with the associations - this would be a hard wall for Brown in the parallel.
But you're supposed to face a few things about the party.
According to the surveys, the conservatives are currently having a serious advantage; Brown has two years to recover the voters behind himself; the only way to take out the win is by the indiscriminate integrity and strong competence.
Card sharks
Does the second market mortgage crisis threaten the credit card market in America?
When blood goes into the water, natural sharks appear nearby.
Now that the American housing market is weak, predators focus on the country's credit card market.
The Goldman Sachs analysts consider that if mortgage loans are affected by other forms of retail credit, the loss of credit card markets can reach up to 99 billion dollars.
The signals of tension are clearly visible.
The rate of both the rate of default and the ratio of late payments over 30 days has increased.
HSBC reported losses of USD 1.4 billion last month in the US consumer financing segment, partly due to the financial weakness of cardholders.
At the same time, panic is too early.
The proportion of descriptions and late payments remains low.
The default payment rate of 3.88%, calculated by Moody's credit rating agency for the third quarter, is one percentage point lower than the historical average.
The reduction of cancers can be explained partly by technical factors.
The changes in US rules on individual insolvency in 2005 have resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of issuers of insolvency, but at the same time caused large losses on the credit card market; the re-emergence of the number of applications for bankruptcy (and this rate of description) is expected, whether or not all of the terms of the credit take-off are broken.
The payment rate, which shows the monthly credit cancellation rate for consumers, is also solid on the market.
In addition, confidence in securities covered by credit cards is rather strong despite the malnutrition of structured finance in other areas.
Dennis Moroney at the TowerGroup research company estimates that the 2007 emissions volume will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage market crisis on the credit card market are clear: consumers are increasing debt on credit cards to cancel housing loans.
At the same time, card issuers primarily monitor cash movements and not asset values, so the fall in house prices does not necessarily lead to changes in creditworthiness of credit recipients.
The situation can be beneficial for creditors.
If the property is less than the value of the mortgage loan, the incentive for consumers to cancel is reduced; as a result, repayment of debts on credit cards will take precedence over.
When changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can adapt faster and more flexibly to changing conditions than mortgage creditors.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of sudden rebalancing of assets.
"It's unlikely that one day we'll wake up completely revalue the loans," says Gary Perlin, the financial director of Capital One.
If a subprime sudden crisis on the credit card market is less likely, the risk of gradual decline will be much more likely.
If the decreasing housing market prices and the decline in lending are put into recession in America, the industry will certainly look forward to a horrid future.
It's worth watching those predators.
Brit bankers have confessed to the Enron case.
On Wednesday, the three British bankers who were brought before the court to investigate their role as former financial director of Enron, Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were initially found innocent in the charge of seven-day fraud, which is supposed to be cooperating with Fastow in a secret fraud in 2000 that they wanted to be rich at the cost of their employer.
Their trial started in January.
At a court hearing, however, the American district judge, Ewing Werlein Jr., all of them, admitted the guilt of one - order fraud.
Three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group Greenwich NatWeest became known during the two-year publication process in Britain.
Following the collapse of Enron in 2001, the United States is still waiting for you.
The first accusation against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of the government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
According to the three brokers who were surrounded by "NatWest Three", in 2000 he traveled to Houston to prepare for fraud with Fastow and Michael Kopper, who is now the right hand of Fastow.
Fastow, who was responsible for designing numerous frauds that failed Enron, also held the Enron subsidiary to which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any shares in the subsidiary, but the three British men were well aware that the interest was very high.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank’s shares of USD 1 million in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper 250,000 dollars to acquire shares in this company.
According to the defendant, Fastow misguided Enron to purchase the share of the energy company from Greenwich NatWeest, a subsidiary of USD 20 million.
However, the $20 million actually hit the mark of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The charge says the bankers reached $12.3 million, whereas Fastow, Copper and others reached $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed his two-line guilt over the role of Enron’s collapse.
The British three were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently being punished for six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper spent three years and a month in jail in Texas.
Three English men may travel to the United States under a $1,000 bail per head, where they are staying during the trial.
Enron, the seven largest US company ever reported a bankruptcy in December 2001, after the accounting tricks that have been used for years could no longer cover the accumulated millions of debts and the loss-making companies that were reported to the beneficial owner.
As a result of the collapse, thousands of jobs were lost, the market value decreased by more than $60 billion, and the value of pension funds decreased by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, founder of Enron and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their company's bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently in prison for over 24 years.
The conspiracy, fraud and other charges imposed on Lay have ceased to exist with the man's death last year.
No poverty in Moscow
At $54 million, a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with Rolls-Royce engines will begin without breaking the road between Moscow and Los Angeles.
However, this amount is only small cash for some Russian rich.
"18 passengers fit in" said Dan Firer, representative of the Gulfstream.
"No one will order so many sessions because machines are bought for private families or corporate leaders."
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors at the four-day exclusive, Milliomos Fair, which was organized in the huge exhibition hall around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, there are more than 200 other luxury children in the exhibition, hoping that the Russians will be interested in all the yachts covered with diamonds from the mahogany to the fridges worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer carefully observed the bright orange Porsche on the stand next to him.
"A nice car, but it's no match for our products," he said.
"The private aircraft after the United States is the largest market in Russia."
It looks like the Russian capital swims in money like Dallas did it in the light of the oil price explosion.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some American millionaires went to Europe. These Americans were considered to be material people here." - said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholarship from the Davis Centre of the Harvard University of Russia and Eurasia.
Like the Japanese gamblers in Saudi Arabia in the 1970s and Japanese gamblers in the 1990s, the Russians are now acting as the most spectacular poets in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands follow their share of the gold mill.
At a conference organised by the luxury industry in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of the LVMH shared his opinion on how large-value products can be sold on markets similar to Russia.
(The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times, organised the conference.)
According to Forbes' list of richest people in Russia, 53 billion live in Russia, with a total of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reach 103 thousand, who could have a total of $670 billion, determined a study by the researchers of the Economic and Financial Research Centre, which analysed the development of personal welfare in the former Soviet Union.
(The World Bank's data show that in 2005 the number of people under the age of living was 15.8 per cent in Russia.)
"There are hundreds of million people living in Moscow, which is why we are all here" said Nicole Marais, a representative of the London jewelry store David Morris.
Nicole took part in the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are indiscriminate, and men are a real treasure mine."
On Sunday night nights, two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, both were attributed to a millionaire and their clients.
"I've seen cars and tried to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche" said the young Yumatova, who's been rushed into her unique design dress, as if she'd already been used to this drive-in.
The fair was arranged primarily for the new rich, the brand-oriented Russian buyers who were willing to go around a horrendous, cifran decorated venue after several hours, where they could find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pockets, Mölenpick ice cream, normal bullied tables, dubai apartments and Gund ply macks.
For average people, the entry ticket is €30 ($44.57).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best", said Mr Gijrath, who has a Hungarian view of the Dutch portfolio manufacturer, at Royal Delft's stand, in contrast to a wall-sized, hand-painted, blue-painted Rembrandt imitate.
"The Russians, of course, are more interested in the outstanding."
Indeed, the sellers here said that for a long time (this means 10-15 years), wealthy Russians have already been mated by the evasive logos for brands of bagatell, a limited number of copies that would not be able to enter a commercial fair.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, trustees and tourists, spent the place all day long.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday Roman Ershov, director of King Koil's Bed Company, said he sold a mattress made of two $70,000 silk, cashmere and cotton, made of gold thread.
Also on the night of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, A1 Moto's sales associate for providing high-quality cars with modern alarms reported that his company sold a shiny orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire.
Andrei Karapetian, a luxury car with solutions to individual needs, has sold three fridges to Rolls-Royce Phantoms by the President of L.A. Connection on Sunday afternoon.
The reporters were also showing wheels made for the owner of a Russian casino, which he said was involved with Swarovski crystals to create the appearance of a roulette wheel.
A set of fours: $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants pictures of wheels made of struccskins and his wife's face from a circus risk won't necessarily use these things." - said Karapetian.
"Helyette will keep them in the garage guarding 30-40 cars."
Although many of the Russian customers are rich, Karapetian says that the term "Russian millionaire" is not a great privilege these days, given the rapid rise in real estate prices.
"Who bought real estate in Moscow four or five years ago, it's probably a millionaire today, if not in money, but at least on paper."
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least have an appearance of wealth in front of the Russian trust company with Alliance Continen.
The company built four English-style telephones that were sunk with millions of fake dollars of banks.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, told me that his team printed 500 thousand counterfeit banknotes at the Millions' Fair.
Many of the visitors stopped playing with the money, many of them made photos of themselves using a mobile phone as they were in the money ring, or just put a few million dollars in their pocket.
"See, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire" said Karryev.
There's a suspected malpractice behind a death in New Jersey.
The day before Thanksgiving, it happened that Ronald Livingston looked just a little more healthy on the windows of the restaurant, and saw an ambulance stop at Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car arrived shortly later.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stop" said Mr. Livingston on Wednesday, one of the supervisors working at the restaurant.
"That's when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found out that the dead woman was 41 years old, her name is Olga Arroyo.
The investigation is currently being carried out to determine whether death is caused by an intervention by a cosmetic surgeon who is not authorised under West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have so far failed to find out what caused the death of Arroya, but they hope that the outcome of the toxicology tests will lighten this mysterious death, which has caused great pain to the high-ranking staff of the Newark Police.
Arroyo, whose voice was known to many in the department, worked as an assistant to the police director of Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
"He was loyal, patient, and reliable" said McCarthy Arroyo in a Wednesday interview on the phone.
". He was my housekeeper.
He was my protector."
McCarthy said that Mrs Arroyo was a former police officer in Newark, currently married Jimmy Arroyo, working on the Seszpar Products Control Committee, and left two boys, one 14 and one 11 years old, and a step-daughter.
Theodore J. Romankow, U.S. Attorney, Eileen Walsh, Union County's attorney, declared that the detectives were working to find out whether Mrs Arroyo was the victim of an unauthorised surgery.
"He's the probability" said Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Public authorities reports show that they arrived at the house around 3 p.m. on November
21st and Arroyo were found on the couch.
He's already been declared dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed, and for now the police have told me very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't tell me about Castro being heard from the detectives.
Participants in the study will examine whether a part of the house has functioned as medical clinics.
On Wednesday, no one opened a door at Castro's home, where he was standing on a frenzy rose shop in the narrow garden and a songless barking from the back of the house.
In the car driveway, next to the door leading to the basement, there was a blue tank with the label "Etil Vanilin", which is used in food and perfumes to replace the vanilla.
Based on hooks, two mountain bikes were hung up on the side.
McCarthy recalled when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years at the New York Police Department, Mrs Arroyo gave her invaluable help by helping to fit into the unusual and unscrupulous political culture of the new city.
"He always said, "It'll be better to take care of with it."
"He was always here when I arrived in the morning, and he was still inside when I left the evening.
It was a mess."
The expectations of Fed's interest losses lead to a deterioration in the world's stock markets
Share prices jumped on both shores of the Atlantic Ocean yesterday after the statement by the Vice-President of the Central Bank of the United States increased the hope that Fed will try to make investment opportunities easier by means of additional interest cuts.
Stock markets in both London and New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, who declared the Fed president Ben Bernanke to be the right hand, must respond "flexibly and pragmaticly" to the constant unrest on financial markets.
In addition to the clear aim of Kohn to bridge markets in the midst of the signs of the resuscitation of debt, he declared that the current unrest "in part reversed developments in the market at the end of September and October".
He said that if the increased confusion persists, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on the credit position of households and companies.
The statements were understood by investors that Fed is ready to inject fresh capital into US markets or even further interest reductions in order to stabilise credit facilities.
The statements also took place on Wall Street, which has recently been the result of several bad news about the American economy, such as a negative record of the number of apartment sales in the United States.
The impact of financial unrest was also confirmed by the announcement of the Bear Stearns Investment Bank that it would contribute 650 employees as part of the cost reduction and 4 percent of its global labour force to offset losses in the US secondary market housing sector.
A total of 20 jobs in London with 1500 employees are affected by the above measure.
In New York, the average index of the Dow Jones industry increased by 331 points, by 2.55 per cent and closed at 13.289,40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 per cent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165,5 points, 2.7 per cent and closed to 6,306,2 and thus increased the value of British blue chip companies by more than 39.
The German Dax increased by 2.6 percent, while the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Credit market anxiety has been renewed since the European Central Bank's large-scale auction of three-month-long paper, which has not been seen since April 2001, was 4,7 %.
Since the interbank interest rate in England reached the highest level after the steady growth since September 12 November, the Bank of England was all under pressure to follow Fed and the ECB and to release additional capital to the London money market.
In England, the decision is followed by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
Two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who has the English team in 6th place in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in the context of the first test against Sri Lanka, it's not even less important who makes the decision?
The latter question is, on the one hand, current because David Graveney, the chairman of the team, who temporarily performs this task, will assist coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan in the decision. On the other hand, because the branch of the British Executive Director, Hugh Morris's desk, will begin to deal with requests for a national or at least one-time picker post.
Among the two players, pull the shorter which does not receive the sixth hit place, but as known, life, and especially sport often unfair.
It's never easy to say what makes someone's professional peak, while others can't get past a lower level. It's often more fortunate than talent.
It is not only a criticism that it is difficult to choose - often on a subject basis - on a subject basis.
Did the time come for Bopara to make progress?
Is it fair to see Shah if that happens?
The same question may arise in other areas of life, for example, if we say John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two young leaders with excellent qualifications, who know business, and only one of them has room for one of them.
Who can tell what level a critical player is on without throwing into deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, the data have a major impact on the decision, but the options are equally important.
In one team, the player has to catch the captain's sight in the critical cabinet at the right moment, and a batter has to get a chance to become a big player once.
Catch the look of the selections is much more complicated.
James Anderson, for example, has played better in the last season, yet he still thinks he's a certain team member on the first test, even though Stephen Harmison's own way of saying that he's in good shape and that he's doing very well.
Anderson had 32 first-class gate hits and 33 runs to fight to take part in the tour.
Chris Tremlett only hit 29, but both of you have had a successful moment at the highest level, and they hope that these will be in the future.
If Shah or Bopara will play at the Asigiriya Stadium, well, that will be decided on the basis of the opinions.
This decision may or may affect anyone's career, but it may not have any particular impact on the future.
Four years ago Sri Lankanan Gareth Batty played with five gates and 40 useful runs well, yet at the time, Paul Collingwood, who broke up was the one who was a criticalist and a decisive test, who may still be undervalued even today, even though he obtained a double hundred points against Australia.
It is likely that during their discussion in Asgriiya Stanion during today's game, listening to the conservative instincts of Graveney, Vaughan and Moore, Shah will put their voks, Bopara's young life force and dynamics in addition to his greater experience.
They're both on the line.
She's talking about a bright and successful debut in the 88th Bombay test quarters, seven years younger than Bopara six, who also reached 32 first-class hundreds of screws.
However, the fact that Middlesex player Shah ran only ten in two quarters of the West Indies at home in May, the Lorda test, and the fact that the Vaughan fighting for re-enactment in the next game, seems to have reduced the endurance that was clearly visible in Bombay.
Against him, Essex's universal talent is a lifeline and inextricable player.
There's nothing to be alarmed about on the critical track, but he described his outside behaviour well when the team's sponsor, Volkswagen's four-wheeler, was upset at an exhibition.
He got minor injuries and probably also shocked. Nevertheless, the first thing he did after was to hold (naturally sponsored) Vodafone's phone and called his remote teammate Alastair Cook to ask him: "You saw this?"
Bopara is a better tracker with classes. It creates an advantage to its medium steps, and its punches are confident and capable.
Choosing the right person is one thing and another is the right moment.
Maybe it's the true art of choosing.
I personally would now give Bopara the chance, which doesn't mean that I don't think Shah would offer an outstanding if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he's the one who plays this weekend.
They're transporting refugees home with buses to work and fight Al-Qaida.
Since yesterday, the first buses from Syria have arrived in Baghdad with the Iraqi refugees who have lost their money or ran out of visas, or are actually those who hope that the order in the city has come back again.
There are also those who have returned to fight with the soldiers who have taken them from their homes.
The bus station in Mansour was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before an 800-person government congress from Damascus arrived.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Dr. Sabah al-Qubaisi.
"I returned today because I saw what happened in Baghdad on TV and in the papers and that the city is now safe.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he added, referring to the priest Moqda al-Sadr mililist, who has currently stopped his ski army.
The 38-year-old ski teacher, Qassim al Atwani, from Amariyah, mostly living by sunnits, returned home with two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented the Iraqis from working.
His ski neighbors called him and urged his return, saying that the teams supported by the Americans were able to squeeze Al-Qaida out of their castle in the western part of the capital.
One of Jordan’s first members was a commanding officer of the Sudanese tribe who escaped from the home in Sleikh North Baghdad after encouraging his fellow citizens to fight against Al-Qaida.
He came back to fight back.
"Two days ago, my friends called me and told me that they had established an anti-Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh, and they needed my support and my sons.
That's why I came back today" said the 62-year-old Sabah Alu Obei.
Many have talked about the fact that in the capital, the peace and the armed civilian forces, which have been strengthened since the involvement of the American troops, have been lured home by armed forces.
But more have been forced to return from Damascus because of water - related and financial problems.
The 51-year-old, three-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai voiced a wide-ranging view among the refugees that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki requested the Syrian Government to reject the visa application for refugees to force their return.
It's said that more than two and a half million people have escaped from the country's death squads.
"It was all right until Al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government not to issue more visas for Iraqis, in order to move them home," said the Sinnia pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I escaped."
One of the reasons for the mitigation of violence is that the sunnits were removed from the ski areas, while the skis also left the suburbs of sunnia, resulting in a reduced tension in many areas.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will re-create the fields that may lead to more battles.
Small Saar-land - innovation training
The smallest Federal province plays a leading role in vocational training, and its higher education is an international orientation.
Only in one field of training, the islanders are struggling with the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"Today, I explained 50 times to an island outside of the island that we are not French," this is a self-roronic slogne poster on the occasion of the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the Saar-land education system, which, according to the survey by the German Institute for Economic Affairs (IW), can boast the fifth place.
In this way, higher education institutions, even because of traditions, work closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Students here can close their studies with a double or even three degrees until today.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high by 15.6 per cent.
However, island-land learning also has an average over-the-art charm for those who want to study in the Saarland colleges and universities - many of them do not have high-school qualifications.
"In the island, they take advantage of the opportunities of vocational training," explains Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert at the German Institute of Economics.
Young people receive further education in more than a fifth grade school, with more than seven percent increase in the federal average in Saarland.
The possibility of a combination of vocational and higher education and training has also been well established.
The infrastructure for dual studies is the second place in Germany, given the population number.
Despite practical training and growing interest, however, the number of senior engineers has decreased by one third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education in the island therefore required higher education institutions to have a marketing campaign which focuses on engineering science.
"In primary schools, we initiated a number of reforms following the first Pisa study," said a spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has conducted comparative tests across the country.
For children to start learning earlier, the last preschool year is free of charge. It is a model that, in the meantime, the rest of the federal provinces began to copy.
To ensure that students' performance is continuously improved, only future comparative studies will be available.
Based on the Pisa survey carried out in 2003, the risk-related proportion of students shrunk from 29 to 20 per cent.
However, overall, the performance of the Saarland has not improved as far as the rest of the Federal provinces have.
The Bajorans count better.
The biggest revenge of the islanders during the Pisa survey does not take account of the foreign language expertise - otherwise it would be possible to reap balconies in this area,
As the language of the neighbouring countries is mandatory in high schools, even if the island regions are not French.
Chávez sets hours
In Venezuela, hours are different in the near future than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez reverses the timeometers in the Latin American country for half an hour.
Meanwhile, Chávez in Spain became a subject of laughter.
As stated by the Venezuelan official page, under a new law, the hours will be reversed by four and a half hours compared to the time of Greenwich.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
The United States Anti-Cahávez, among other things, justified its decision to force all-hour-based time zones to the world.
Chavez also announced on Wednesday that the relations with neighboring Colombia would be interrupted because of a hostage.
The nationalist politician on the left said that until the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, neither the Head of State nor the Colombian government will maintain contact.
"I can't do this because of my dignity", said Chávez, who is calling for a constitutional reform which the citizens of the country of oil should deliver an opinion on Sunday in the context of a referendum.
The reform would significantly build its power in the country.
The reason for the debate was Uribe's decision to withdraw his mandate from Chávez to negotiate with the Marxist rebels in Colombia about the release of hostages.
Uribe's choice of "arcul keelpte" Venezuela gave her criticism on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain speaks of Chávez.
In the country, a new mobile voice has highlighted: "Port quo no te Callas" (Why don't you shut your mouth), so it sounds like the sentence that more than half a million people have been spending on the Internet.
The sentence comes from Charles, the king of Spain, who has been so upset at the last Latin America Summit, by the constant involvement of the populist politician in Baloldia, in this way cut into his word.
The Germans are threatened by less wages in 2007
A real wage reduction is forecast to threaten German workers this year, despite a strong conjunctivion.
Experts have supported their pessimistic forecast for circulatory reasons.
According to the Hans-Bröckler Foundation, employees can actually pay less than in the previous year in 2007.
"The reason for this modest wage development, the increase in the general tax on turnover and the rapid rise in food and energy prices", said Gustav Horn, associate of the Macroeconomic and Culture Research Institute.
Another burden on workers can also be attributed to unemployment insurance.
Mr Peer Steinbrück, Minister for Finance, stated in his statement to the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that, in the current situation, the reduction of the right and reasonable unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent at the beginning of the new year.
In all cases, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be so difficult to apply to the Association for credit or support, quoted the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD politician.
Tuesday, it was known that the price explosion of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation of 13 years.
In annual comparison, prices increased by 3 per cent.
Venus to the Devil's Brother on Earth
Despite the tension of Venus's atmosphere, it is more similar to the Earth than it has been assumed to be: in its atmosphere, the flashes of the European "Venus Express" space were discovered in Europe, and in its corner, it has discovered wind currents like in the winter of the Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists assume that Venus flashes.
The European "Venus Express" spacer provided evidence - discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: Vénuszon’s flashes spread from cloud to cloud at 56 km high, reports Christpher Russel, a co-worker from the University of California of Los Angeles.
According to the famous "moreorious theory", lightnings caused the development of Earth’s life: According to the theory, zivatars introduced reactions in the ocean that led to the development of amino acids, the belts of life.
Not so with Venus: "If there ever existed life there, it could have been in the very early days," explains Sean Solomon from the Washington Carnegie Institute.
At present, there is hardly a living organism on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere on the wheels is 100 times thicker than on the Earth, and temperatures sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"It may be that Venus is the twin brother of the world, but yet it is his twin brother," he nailed it with Rus.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus, such as in its mass and size, is moving on a different path of development in its entirety.
The start of the "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in the Venus survey, because since the beginning of the 90s no probe had been on its way to explore this planet.
According to researchers, the latest research results presented in the article "Nature" show not only the uniqueness of Venus's solar system.
"They also report that the similarity of the neighbouring planet to Earth is greater than we assumed," Esa said.
In addition to the already known Northern-Sarki Rounds, researchers have discovered an even faster - moving cloud pole on the South Pole.
The phenomenon reminds the air currents of the Earth's winter hemisphere, states the research group led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second largest planet of the solar system is almost the same as the Earth, and with a diameter of 12.100 miles [12.100 km], it is almost as large as the Earth.
Even the celestial body called Esthahalläsillas avoids the sun in just 225 days.
However, it will turn more slowly around its own axis: one day it will take 243 days on earth.
Although the 460 Celsius-foss surface temperature associated with Venus 92 bar pressure barely reminds the Earth, scientists are based on the fact that both planets were born in completely similar circumstances.
Both of them gathered water that remained on Earth as an ocean while Venus went to the universe.
And while carbon dioxide on the Earth is bound in carbon blocks, Venus is a large part of the atmosphere.
Köhler is protecting Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
Mr Köhler, the President of the German Republic demands the end of the debate between the parties, which occurred around the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office.
He referred to the SPD in an indirect way as a critic for attacking the Chancellor after the September reception.
The German President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's authority and called for the big coalition to close the debate about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"In this matter, we should not be seen as a divided nation towards the outside world," said Köhler, on the Handelsblatt page.
At the same time, Köhler expressed his understanding of Angela Merkel's acceptance of the Dalai Lama in September.
" Human rights apply to me on a universal scale even if I respect the diversity of cultures", said Köhler.
Everyone is aware that Germany needs to look after the delicate balance of foreign policy, stressed the President of the Republic; however, Merkel was defending against the accusation that the Chancellor would pursue a new Chinese policy.
The Federal Chancellor did not break up with the traditional Chinese policy.
China is aware of this too," explained Köhler.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister for Foreign Affairs (SPD) indirectly expressed his denial over the reception of the Dalai Lama, and therefore became a target for attacks in the EU.
Mr Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's 'Crap Policy' in the area of foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office, there were acute disturbances in the German-China situation.
Thus, Chinese leadership did not only return to the invitation of German finance minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to the information provided by SPIEGEL, he also frozen the so-called strategic partnership between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the two countries.
Wen Jiabao's Chinese Head of State has now called for recognition of Angela Merkel's federal Chancellor that it was a mistake to receive the Dalai Lama.
China rejects the formal adoption by European politicians of the Tibetan religious leader in their official quality, confirmed the Chinese position, Wen Jiabao.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama pointed out that he was trying to break up the additional Tibetan territories including Tibet and other provinces from China.
Schäuble is protected from disturbances such as France
Street collisions with the police, shootings, flames cars: Wolfgang Schäuble protects people like France from disturbances.
Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not go into street violence, requires the Federal Minister of Home Affairs.
Barricades were languished, and those who were randomly shot at the police with a beer rifle: After the serious disturbances of young French people, Mr Wolfgang Schäuuble, Federal Minister of Home Affairs (CDU) is looking at similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful that the social explosive does not grow up in our house, and that he should not be put into violence.
We have to take it seriously," he said to the Neue Presse News in Hanover.
Not all young people adapt to rapid changes in social reality.
The Alliance, provinces and communities are currently working intensively on solving the problem, said Schäuble.
This is not only about the integration of immigrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, the first successes are now closing."
However, it is still too early to resolve the emergency.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that in the German suburbs, there are no urban and sociological problems such as France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris over the last night, young people have fought serious street battles with the police.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were also flamed.
In view of this, the Federal Government called for more activity in the field of integration from Kian Kolat, the head of the German Turkish Communities.
In the context of the disturbances in France, Kolat warned about the dangers of follow-up.
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as France,
But action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that among young people under 25 years of age from immigrant families, unemployment was "higher than average".
More education places should be provided before all.
Kolat stressed: "We need to provide a family perspective for young people."
However, the Turkish Community leader added that "social supervision within the family" in Germany is more present than in France.
In addition, many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built up here.
Kolat warns: "Although we have to be busy, we have to be busy."
"The opportunity for young people to have work and to receive education should be faster."
Meanwhile, in Paris' suburbs, in Villiers-le-Bel, there was complete rest during the night.
Hundreds of police were ready for deployment, pasting the area with a helicopter light.
The competent authorities have reported three arrests and a few flints of garbage and car.
Since the report, a 1000-person security unit will take care of the peace of mind.
The police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, the Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie has announced after her visit to the suburbs.
During the Tuesday night, 80 police officers were wounded as a result of the disturbances in the wilders-le-bel.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
There was a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
State Attorney General's first finding that the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
Clouding in Angela's Empire
The fact that the Chancellor's action has been agitated from reality is proof that the coalition is at the end - and that nothing is expected of it.
Which country is the Federal Chancellor actually living in?
Following its intervention in the general debate of the Bundestag, it is necessary to establish: he does not live here - not in the country whose governance would be his business.
With a very modest sentence, Angela Merkel called for her to focus too much on foreign policy.
That's provincial, he answered, and in such a way he just made a statement that he didn't want to understand what the critics were talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, it made it clear to everyone that the brows of eye can be found.
In the meantime, no particular interest or empathy was felt about the country's problems.
Instead, Angela, the Renegade, appeared: a political politician who has a problem with reality who has fled to foreign politics and who is only his own insecurity.
Example of climate protection: For the Heiligendamm Resolutions, Heiligendami does not control himself, but he listens to how the clearing goals in the country should be achieved.
At all, as far as self-esteem is concerned, this kind of intolerance would not have been granted by the President of CDU itself two years earlier.
Now it's stuck in that frasis that the prosperity is having a positive effect on people.
This harms the good news of a pragmatic person who can solve the problems instead of words.
However, in Angela’s cloudy empire, the internal political problems are only side-by-side.
Child poverty and the problems of low incomers?
It's only worth a few half-words.
In this context, it is clear how often a language bottling is taking place when it comes to family replacements.
There's three times Merkel's gonna have to roll over to bring together a half-naked sentence.
If it's specific, it's in a foreign area.
Roham Division
During the debate between the Republican presidential candidates on Youtube, the two Favorite, Rudy Giuliani and Mit Romney, they must also be kept from an outside candidate.
The tensions of candidates on the first topic have already been brought to the surface.
Mitt Romney's telling the opponent, Rudy Giulian, that he's made New York City a "allied immigrant".
Who, on his own, is concerned with serious facts: "I would say that his own house served as a shelter for illegal immigrants", he cuts back to Giulian, and he throws it in the eyes of the former governor of Massachusetts, who used to employ non-documented immigrants as a private man.
As the Republican camp still has no unitedly supported favorie, the eight president-in-Offices will use the debate on CNN to undermine their opponent's credit.
The 30-second video sent by Internet users via Youtube is hardly more than a short summary.
"With this type of isolacionism, we have brought Hitler to power," said John McCain, under the nose of Ron Paul, who, as one of the participants of the circle, requires immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney's head is also well washed by the vet that went to Vietnam when he is drawn to condemn the so-called Waterboarding as torture, the interrogation method in which the water is symptomatic.
However, that the important topics of the campaign, while not only go beyond the debates on Iraq and torture, are shown by the reactions of the audience of St. Petersburg in Florida.
There is a loud touch in the room at the praise of conservative values and in the rejection of future tax increases.
Meanwhile, the two candidates are increasingly showing weaknesses.
"I was wrong back then," says Romney, guilty of having to apologize to the supporters and television viewers for putting down the vox next to the end of the pregnancy in 1994.
Giulian, however, is agitated when he is asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first governs as a civilian
One day after his return from the army, he was brought to the fall of President Musharraf who exercises power in Pakistan.
This will put an end to eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, has been sued for a further five-year term of office.
The Pakistani television from the capital city, from the Islamic Presidential Palace, transmitted the ceremony alive.
Musharraf has sworn to the Constitution, and that his people will act in behalf of him.
On Wednesday, he handed his military leadership office to Ashfaq Kiyan and thus allowed the international pressure from the United States.
After eight years of co-optimony without bloodshed, the former general now governs as civil heads of state for the first time.
Musharraf has met a fundamental demand of the West and the opposition by returning as chief commander of the armed forces.
Another important claim is the abolition of the extraordinary condition, which was published by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Advocate General Malik Muhammad Qayum, after not much longer has fallen, Musharraf will eliminate the extraordinary condition with which the West will meet a further demand.
The Supreme Court of the country, to which Musharraf, at the beginning of early November, has introduced her‐sympathizing lawyers, has rejected any objection in connection with the re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers lost their lives as a result of an attack on a military conveyor in northern Venice, and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesperson, the bomb exploded on a road close to the Afghanistan border.
Fathers of Krautrock are returning
With music again, the German super team in the 70s: The three band members of Harmonia repressed his instrument until a concert in Berlin.
With the re-convent, a cut-off will appear from their light age, 'Live 1974' time.
They were well known abroad at that time.
The notified sensation killed the body of the three agreed gentlemen around the dinner table.
First of all, his own instrument, his own cable, and all his own buttons.
Dieter Moebius is in the middle of a snow-white shirt after his 63 years.
Michael Rother, who is 57 years old from left, provides escorts to a laptop and guitar.
From the right to the public, your 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius curve and concentrates on the console.
Each one produces some sort of noise, while at one time or another rhythm.
And it's sometimes, by chance, connected to traditional music.
All of this, however, seems to be not particularly disturbing for you gentlemen.
It was a great excitement for the fans of the Krautrock Music Guide that Harmonia's band was playing again.
What we can already tell you here is that as a result of an adequate follow-up, the name went through the collective monument, but in no case left lasting signs that we would have missed this band painfully after 32 years.
But why can't the Germans celebrate the legends of their 70s?
Especially that what we call a misguided carutrock, England and America have always appreciated more than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award for Lifework to Can's remaining members in 2003, the German pop figures in the room sat with an unintelligible face.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers tabled even the La Dusseldorf and the Neu! concerts, the wonders became limitless.
At the concerts, Michael Rother was sitting on the stage as an old buddy of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Domestic rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
The memory is beyond Harmonia because the trio existed for only two years, and during this time it had a far less effect than others had been attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with Conrad Schnitzler in the past under the very promising Cluster name.
At first, they played in the basement under Schaubühne Theatre in Berlin.
Then in Dusseldorf, for economic reasons, a record company financed by the church.
Rother helped the Kraftwerk band for a short time, and in parallel, it may have been the most radical German band, Neu!
However, in 1973, Roth followed Cluster’s musicians into their exile at Weserbergland Forst.
There, in Alter Weserhof, a 16th century Rem lived as a Communion escaped from town.
It's less neurological than in Communa I, where Roedelius was still in trouble as a sitter.
Their lives are more of an idyllic art.
According to the trash, Harmonia Ottostein's Dalaárda flag, and that's how they found a name for their art.
Some of these things were recorded by Harmonia.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and "De Luxe".
Despite his peaceful and modest music, the band needed material.
The stock collection alone didn't provide for ourselves to be found.
The CD that was released in 'Live 1974' was recorded at a concert in Griesem, in front of a barely 50-person record audience, so someone remembers.
Harmonia's efforts and occasional practice at that time were Roth's idea.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral claim.
The gang announced its distribution in 1975.
Roth ended up at the esoterics and kept himself from albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Clauser has been re-elected in the eighties, which has been more successful since then than Harmonia has ever been.
It's thanks to the live album ofgriesem, Herbert Grönemeyer.
His listening to Grönland was designed to care for the Krautrock as a special German gift of his living music.
In this context, Neu! has already been produced in the same way as Roedelius'ssis.
Harmonia will be raised at the House of Cultures in Berlin.
Public money, within the Weldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, author of our British ancestor and the "Krautrock Sampler" manual are also present.
There's also the idea owner of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
The impact of carutrock on the future pop music period is roughly bounded by this.
In this regard, Harmonia will fill out the empty space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno's finding with the most unusual sounds lies in the room: "The only true music, he owns the future."
There are pictures that picture the producer with Harmonia in the room of a peasant house.
The drawing of other black and white photographs of the Kosa cable equipment serves legend construction.
In the foreground, the three veterans re-enact with improvisation.
This simply means that microphones are attached to the organ and drum equipment, with the intention that the instrument itself, using the instruments that produced the sound effects, has not yet been heard.
Today, electric music looks like electric music.
Three, technique-educated dummies.
Not even the homeless do anything about this.
Under Barbara Morgenster's leadership, they cough and kiss, and they sing "Aaaaah" with a beautiful sense of it.
The carutrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music colleges (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in the escape of artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone's crying "'68!", it doesn't go completely wrong, and Harmonia won't leave you alone for this reason.
Even the most self-evident thing is thought through on the stage.
Where does the music begin, and where does it end?
This can make you crazy, or you can give it to the moments of exceptional happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough.
Through the "Scramble" and the "Mörderischer Frieden", two films deal with the Balkans war.
However, none of them are convincing.
It's about the basic thinking or too much about the action and shooting, or it's too emotional.
Even Richard Gere can't help us with that in "Captain."
First of all, the good news: While the two war criminals, Karajics and Mladics are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, there they found him again in the dark back of the war in Bosnia, Richard Gere.
In recent times, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man in the eighties, since the role of many good boys in emotional films for women and the numerous press conferences in the Buddhism topic have even taken advantage of having a look at it.
And here's what Richard Gere is all about, all of a sudden, besides maybe we'll see the movie "Walking".
It is wonderful, it gives an impressive design: It is basically Simon Hunt, who has been formed by him, is what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry were not so kind to him: A man who left his most beautiful years long ago, but his decline in his romantic monument still preserved a significant part of his former attraction.
However, despite this, the German production "Mörderischer Frieden" started this week, the film "Valdation" continues only the endless series of failed films about the Balkans war.
We don't have to waste much on "Mörderischer Frieden": The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrin Topol, Max Riemelt), who are saving a Serbian woman from Kosovo, and one of them suddenly loves it.
Although it is to be welcomed that this time it is not the Serbs that are pictured as the only cause of all the bad, a film of the lowness of television movies is too quickly lost in shooting and event-related scenes.
"Cobra 11" is carrying a sign - instead of a highway, it's a war.
On the other hand, it can be considered exemplaryly in the case of "Walking", why, in fact, not even a really good movie about war in the Balkans.
The story of the three U.S. Warlords who are coming up to investigate the Serbian war criminal listening to the name "Roka", other director, other scriptwriters (both Richard Shepard's persuasion Union) could have become a new "Apocalypse now" in another age.
Because stories show a surprising similarity: In both cases small groups cut into the forest to accomplish what the army is unable to do - and in both cases the crazy journey.
One of the reasons for the failure of the "Walking" is that it simply doesn't allow Simon Hunt to be the snooped cynical of his heart, as at the beginning presents him.
No, and as a result of the scenario, she's still having a romantic relationship with a Muslim witch who later murdered her.
The "Fight" slides when reporters reach what NATO, the CIA and all the world's main hunters couldn't do in five years when they're going to give him the war criminal to the Mohamedans for fair revenge.
It's so bad that you'd rather go to the Hague International Law Court for the crime against the logic of the movie.
But the film's purpose is profoundly human.
He intends to put you on the brink that Karajics and Mladics are still on the loose and suspecting Americans and French (which is said to be exceptionally united in this respect) that, due to secret political deals, they do not pursue the persecution forcefully.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar to each other that you can think of a famous Brecht version.
This poet writes on the face of the Asian demon on his desk: "I am staring at the brink on his halon, which tells us: how tiring it is to be bad."
Movies such as "The Watch" have the same oversized, human-shaped masks, but they show how tidy they are.
This problem is not only limited to the works of the Balkan war movies.
It was recently reported in the newspaper that all the films about Hollywood, Iraq were a terrible fall.
We can add: There is not yet any good movie about South Africa.
It's almost always true: If a star comes out of the world's crisis goales or mines, it's like "The Ways of Freedom" with Patricia Arquette, Angelina Jolie, or "The Poor Diamond" with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close in terms of time.
For decades, Hollywood was able to film a good film about the holocaust with the "Schindler List" film.
A few movies are probably still available - since today's works of the Vietnam War, such as "the deer hunter", "the Apocalypse now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were not celebrated as a master artist in their time.
But it is possible that these days, when all mass killings arrive in our home on two screens, we simply know too much about the world's conflicts.
And that deprives the scriptwriters of ignoring reality, which is what we need to tell the good stories.
After all, they didn't know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't be trying to do the right thing if you want to make a good movie.
Maybe we need to put this novelist Lawrence Norfolk in a sarcasticly distant artistic view.
When his historical novel Lemprière and the parallels between the Balkans war, he was suffocated, he replied: "It's only because certain things never change.
The big cities will always be very dangerous, they will always kill people in a terrible way, and war will always rule in Yugoslavia."
Von Beusto is being criticised for the resignation of the Olympics
The mayor’s determination to organise the Summer Olympic Games in Hamburg gave rise to strong criticism in political and economic life.
Many want to fight for the arrangement of water games.
However, Von Beust is strongly warned of reality during the process of giving a chance.
On Wednesday, the Director General of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, recognised the withdrawal as "no favour for the economic environment".
No other project has recently released such huge motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
Without this aim, we cannot maintain the momentum of sport policy to a level playing field."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative that would be "set out of modified time coordinates".
Bev von Beust has maintained his previous statements that Hamburg's ambitions for Olympic games are not realistic until at least 2028.
" Hamburg does not decide the Olympics competition, but the German Olympic Sports Association", said von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
After the decision of the Sports Association in early December 2018 on the Munich competition for the Winter Olympic Games.
"The preference for this means for us that we will not have real chances within the period until 2028."
However, we will not give up the dream forever, said von Beus.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) expressed regret over Mr Beust's statements.
This makes the impression that Hamburg does not intend to pursue Olympic games for the next 25 years.
"It's too early to lose a chance to bury our plans now", said Günter Ploß, President of HSB on Wednesday.
The withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement made by the Senate president at the General Assembly of the University of Germany.
It is because the application submitted to Von Beust Hamburg City by the 2015 Universiadéra was characterised by the fact that it is not a substitute for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The University Sport Association only launched Hamburg as a city participating in the competition last week.
The civilian SPD faction has led the Senate to leave a valuable period of time for housing in Hamburg.
"Kleiner Grasbrook has been slowing down the development of the Senate for years, because he was standing next to the Olympics and refused to build his apartment," said two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continued to use the Olympics and later home use integrated plan for Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU unilaterally placed the emphasis on the "event factor".
The competition for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games was at the time a great deal of enthusiasm in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg Lipcsen failed.
These aren't Warhol boxes.
The one who connects the concepts of Sweden and the wall to each other is Ikea, not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently produced villages in Sweden are putting dark shades on the list of Warhol's works.
The ninety-four "Stockholm type" Brillo Box is a large part of a fake.
After a few months of questioning the originality of Andy Warhol's Brillo Box, the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" now came to an impressive conclusion in the internal investigation of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm: A large part of the six "Brillo Box" donated to Moderna Museum in 1995 by Pontus Hultén, former museum director Brillo Box, and most likely to be available on the international art market.
The prehistoric chain of long and complicated artistic and curatorium mutations is confusing.
Warhol created the first painted tiles based on the red-white-white form of "Brillo Boxes" in New York in 1964.
At his exhibition in Moderna Musseet in 1968 - Warhol, with the consent of his work, hundreds of Brillo boxes were collected: These were not from Warhol (for cost savings reasons) but were delivered directly from the Brillo cartel factory.
It wasn't about art works, it was about those templates, simple art pieces.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission in 1968 to sell some of the Brillo Walla in Sweden, but it did not appear in Moderna Musseet.
The Witnesses of the age are now talking about 15 boxes of art and auction history certified as Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the designation "Stockholm".
Some of them were auctioned for over $100 000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director of the museum, was falsely claiming that in 1968 hundreds of walls were produced and manufactured in Sweden, which he then left behind in Warhol.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were manufactured in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in Szent-Pétervár.
At that time, however, Warhol was dead three years ago.
Lars Byström, the main-artist of Moderna Museet, has also examined three of which were owned by six Brillo Box, two of which were made in 1968 in Stockholm: The brown sheets were first cut off and cut off, followed by the white oil painting.
The structure of the copies from 1990 is, in contrast to the fact that the paint was applied directly to the roundboard, and not to oil, but to acrylic paint.
"These boxes are not certified by the artist, so they should be deleted from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Musseet: "Unless the New York Warhol Art Authority Board decides otherwise, the Moderna Museum will be ranked as a copy or exhibition material in its collection."
Of course, the Authority Board announced in June that it would investigate the 'serious charges' raised in respect of soap-poor boxes.
However, they have long been covered in unsolicited silence.
Manila rebel soldiers will give up
They gave up the rebellion in the Philippines, the soldiers who baricated in a hotel in Manila and called for the defeat of President Arroyo Gloria Macapagal.
You can't take responsibility for the bloodshed, you're the head of the hotel, Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud.
Before that, the hotel was hit by light gas-weapons.
The two dozen soldiers have been barricating themselves in the building for hours.
On Thursday, half of the team were in court due to the failed coup trial in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly solve wheels with 30 sympathizers.
Apparently, the military police charged with guarding the man have moved on and joined the press.
They entered the Peninsula-Hotel, then called for the failure of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Fleet units have closed the front desk area.
The president called the security office for an extraordinary meeting.
Norberto Gonzales was convicted of the operation of the soldiers.
"They have enough for people," said Trillanes.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was previously commander of the Scout Rangers elite, declared that other military units wanted to join in a short time.
Government critics called for a strong protest against the President on Friday.
His government has been shadowed by corruption charges for several months.
Manila's financial district was already the main stage in 2003 in the campaign against Arroyo organized by 200 members of the army.
The resurrection failed almost 24 hours ago when the army was drawn to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet is going to be a big share in Versatel
United Internet provided more than 20 percent of its shares in Versatel telecommunications company.
As stated on Wednesday evening, the average price per share was 14,46 Euro.
This is the property of 20.05 percent of the core capital.
The reception has already been discovered before.
The possibility of raising ownership in Versatel remains open.
By this step, they intend to promote consolidation of the German DSL market, reported the United Internet.
Before that, on Wednesday, the bank had already received assumptions of a possible linkage after the Bank of Berenberg increased its share of the dysseldorf network service provider by an additional 5 % to 15.1 %.
The financial institution maintains the participation as only one third party, news about the money market.
On the previous day, the United Internet already owned a narrow 10 percent of Drillisch's mobile phone company.
Within the framework of the capital increase, Drillisch placed EUR 106.4 million in new shares.
United Internet purchased 5,15 million shares for 31,4 million euros.
In addition, companies initiated dialogue on cooperation on the placing on the market of DSL and mobile phone products.
"We're strengthening our partner relationship," said the United-Internet spokesperson.
The two companies jointly set up the MSP Joint Undertaking for the purpose of receiving the competitor Freenet.
The two companies initially meet the good ten percent share in Freenet and do not live with the right to take over 1849 percent of Freenet on Thursday, United Internet announced.
However, the two companies leave all the possibilities open, in particular to increase their share in Freenet AG, the news says.
The United Internet and Freenet negotiations on the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
The poker game, which has been around Freenet for months, is now part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had a mobile phone client with 2.9 million contracts and a client with 1,27 million DSL and fixed access.
The United Internet and the Holding Company built by Drillisch so far had directly 6,01 percent share in Freenet.
Now it's agreed that Drillisch will bring in four percent more wheels.
An agreement was signed in August on the right to purchase 18,49 % of Vatas investment company.
