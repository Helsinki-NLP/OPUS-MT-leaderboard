The members of the Wales National Assembly are afraid to find themselves in the Muppet Show
Some members of the National Assembly were shocked at the proposal that their address would change to MWP (Man of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Wales Parliament).
The ritual came after the name of the National Assembly (Assembly) was rather called the Wales Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
Now, the different political backgrounds are all afraid that the new title may make them a subject of laughter.
According to one of the Labour Party Members, his group is concerned that his new name will be drawn to the words Twp and Pwp.
Not for ourwales readers: in the Wales language, the twp is one-on-one, and pwp is a cock.
According to one of the parties' representatives, the whole group is "unsatisfied", and alternatives are therefore proposed.
One of the conservative Members said that his group "opened" for the change of name, but he noted that MWP was just a jump from the "Muppet".
Here it is worth noting that the letter “w” in Wales is written like “u” in Yorkshire in English, i.e. “map” in MWP.
The position of the National Assembly Committee responsible for drawing up a draft law on name change is as follows: "For the titles for the appointment of members of the National Assembly, the final decision is naturally in the hands of Members."
The 2017 Act governing the Wales Government allowed the Wales National Assembly to change its name.
The Commission published in June the results of the public consultation on the proposal to register the name of the Wales Parliament and received broad support.
As regards the title of the Members, the Commission favours the title of the Member of the Welsh Parliament (representative of the Wales Parliament) and the shortening of the WMP, but the public consultation supported the option of MWP.
Members are faced with new and new alternatives, but the agreement is rather difficult, which is a problem for the president of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who has to submit a proposal for a law on name changes in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly at other points, including as regards the discretion of Members and the Commission structures.
Members will be able to take their final position on the matter of their own title during the discussion of the draft law.
Macedonia has a referendum on changing the country's name
Citizens vote Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of Moldova.
The aim of the referendum is to make a point with neighbouring Greece, one of whose provinces is also called Macedonia, at the end of a long decades' debate.
For a long time, Athens has expressed its support in essence for a territorial demand under the name of its northern neighbour and has repeatedly objected to its request for EU and NATO reception.
President Gjorge Ivanov Macedón himself opposes the referendum on change of names and does not participate.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of names is simply a compromise that must be linked to their EU and NATO accession.
Harlemian churches are in a difficult situation, and the bells of St. Martin are also silent.
“As I hear from the elders, there was a bar and a temple on every corner, ” says Adams.
- Not one of them anymore."
As you say, the absence of bars would even be understandable.
“ People are getting involved differently these days, ” she says.
– Bars are no longer the social days where people end daily."
As far as churches are concerned, Adams is afraid that the sale of church wealth will not replace the hopes of the leaders, “and they will keep again in the same time as they left.”
And in the place of the churches, it adds, residential buildings that will not also help the fate of the remaining churches will be avoided.
“In these buildings, the vast majority of buyers will have white skin,” states, “and this will continue to rush the final closure of the churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these apartments would join the religious community.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem grew itself to be a black town — the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martin, a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out of church in the thirty years,
It was then held by a nearby black congregation.
The black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson took over St. Martin's church – the respecter is the grey shopping street, 125th Street is known to apply black people or to lead black products against non-restricted business owners.
In 1939 a fire had caused serious damage to the building, but during the renovation the bell game was built to order a respectable Johnson community.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and his successor at St. Martin's parish, proudly mentioned the bells of the poor.
In July, an expert in the bell game said that this bell game is a "cultural heritage", a "an indispensable historical instrument".
The expert at Michigan University, Tiffany Ng, also noted that this was the first bell game in the world, which was spoken by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who stood 18 years ago at the larger bell game of Riverside Church.
According to Merriweather, the St. Martin didn't sign anybody.
In St. Martin, in recent months, a complicated situation has broken down with the participation of architects and entrepreneurs, partly involved in the secular leadership of the church, partly by the Bishop's Office.
In July, the governing body of the Parokia, the Council of the European Communities referred to the Bishop's office in writing, objecting that the Office would “supplement the costs” to the Council, although the Council did not participate in the selection of architects and entrepreneurs by the Office.
Some members of the religious community complain about the lack of transparency around the office.
Papa attacked a 13-year-old Californian boy while he was eating cancer.
According to official reports, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while fishing for cancer on the opening day of the cancer season in California on Saturday.
The attack took place before 7:00 A.M. at the Beacon's Beach Coast in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel, on the San Diego KSWB TV channel, told me that he and his friends had been diving about half an hour on Saturday morning when he was paying attention to the fact that a boy was crying out for help.
Hammel first thought that the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a cancer, but then he realized that the boy shouted, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
“ The shoulder was torn down at the front of the key bone, ” Hammel explained what he saw when he got to the boy.
– I began to excite everyone to go out of the water: “I have a shark in the water”, he added.
The boy was transferred to a child hospital in San Diego, San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The shark's tree attacking the boy is unknown.
As Captain Larry Giles told the press, a few weeks earlier, a shark was detected in the area, but then it was found that it was not one of the dangerous species for man.
Captain Giles also said that the boy suffered trauma on his upper body.
The authorities closed the coast between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours for the time and safety reasons of the investigation.
Giles says that more than 135 sharks occur in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
The Sainsbury's would expand on the British beauty market
The Sainsbury's expert salesmen and big-scale Piperists would take the competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
The decline in sales of fashion and household articles, as part of the growth in the British beauty market of GBP 2.8 billion, is the test of larger size pipers across the chain across 11 stores and, if successful, they will also appear in new stores from next year.
The strengthening of the piper line is due to the fact that store houses are trying to fill up the shelf areas previously occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and household articles.
Sainsbury's told me that he doubles his supply to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, for the first time.
But earlier brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be placed in a larger area on brand-based stands such as Boots and similar stores waiting for customers.
The chain also restarts the Boutique Make-up family, where most of the products are now vegan – because these are now more and more young customers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfumer tested its appearance in two Sainsbury's stores, one of which has already been opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while the other opens this year at Birmingham Selly Oak.
With the spread of online purchases and the shifting of food shopping practices towards small local trades, major investors need to make greater efforts to attract customers.
According to the CEO of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, the supply will be more and more similar to the mixed trade, as the supply chain will try to compete with discounts such as Aldi and Lidl, with more services and other products other than food.
Since the two chains were purchased two years ago, the Argos classes were opened in hundreds of stores in Sainsbury's, as well as some Habitat classes – this step has also had a positive impact on food sales, so the acquisition is even more profitable.
The chain of stores is a failure in its previous attempt to excavate beauty and pharmaceutical classes.
Sainsbury's in a joint venture with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but this was the end of the debate on the distribution of the income of drug classes in the stores.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold his pharmaceutical business for $125 million three years ago to Celesio, the operator of the Lloyds pass chain.
According to the chain of stores, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy, and in four shops it will offer a wider range of luxury skin care products, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As the commercial director of Sainsbury’s, Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We would like to create a more pleasant environment for our customers by changing the look of our pipers.
In addition, we have also hired qualified staff who provide advice to interested parties.
Our brand offer provides all the needs, an attractive environment and a convenient location to be accessible provides an tempting power that will bring about a new level of shopping experience."
Peter Jones "scrambled" after Holly Willoughby resigned from the 11 million-dollar agreement
The Star of Dragons ‘Den, Peter Jones,’ has left after Holly Willoughby’s TV programme manager stopped off from the 11 million important agreements on the distribution of lifestyle products in order to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for Truly's brand of home clothing and accessories.
The company of the two celebrities was compared to the brand Goop registered earlier by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning 37-year-old programme manager announced that he was out on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby pulled out the match from the Star of Dragons’ Den, Peter Jones, when he got out of their promising, lifestyle-seller business at the last minute, to focus on his own highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones’s “created” when on Tuesday, at the headquarters of Jones’s business empire, he announced that, due to his new contracts with a total value of £1.5 million, there was no time left for their common brand of home clothing and accessories to be dedicated to Truly.
The two famous companies were compared with the Goop brand previously listed by Gwyneth Paltrow and were expected to double Willoughby's estimated assets to £11 million.
While the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would leave Truly, Jones went from island to one of his cottages.
According to one source: “To Truly was far from Holly, the most important thing.
He was going to deal with this in the long run, and this will give him his livelihood over the next few decades.
Being out was a surprise for everyone.
He surprised everyone that happened on Tuesday, because the start was so close.
The warehouse in Marlow's office is full of the goods waiting for sale."
According to experts, the departure of one of the most profit stars in this Morning show in Britain could cost the company millions of dollars from pillows and candles to the choice of clothing and home clothing and possible slides.
And it could mean the end of an old friendship.
The three-year-old director and husband Dan Baldwin and his wife had a close friendship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby launched Truly in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones took over the presidency in March.
The two couples usually spend their vacation together, and Jones has 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production office.
Willoughby will be the M&S product face and take over Ant McPartlin as the programme manager for the ITV I'm Celebility show.
A source close to Jones last night commented: “We do not want to comment on [Jones]' business affairs.”
They said hard words, "We fell in love,"
He was making fun of what criticisms he will receive from the press for the statement that some might consider to be “no one, ” and for which he expressed such a positive statement about the North Korean leader.
“ Why did Trump allow so much?
– asked Trump in a funny "snakes" voice.
"I didn't let any of you."
As noted, Kim would like to meet for the second time after the first meeting in Singapore in June, Trump welcomed North Korea as a huge step towards nuclear weaponry.
However, the discussions on nuclear weaponry have been shattered.
After more than three months of the June Singapore Summit, Ri Jongho, a representative of North Korea, said to the UN General Assembly that, as his country sees, the United States did not take the early steps in the armed forces of North Korea.
Instead, it is said that the United States will continue to maintain the sanctions for the exercise of pressure.
Trump said more optimistic in a campaign talk.
“ Things are going great with North Korea, ” he said.
– We were going to have a war with them.
Millions of people would have been lost there.
But now we have a very good relationship."
As he said, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results – the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he was so unusually talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's not hard to behave first, but now there's no crowd of 10,000 people trying to get in here for a long time, only two hundred before me," Trump said, pointing to the group ahead.
In Indonesia, hundreds of dead people have the island of tsunamis and earthquakes.
Indonesia, after the earthquake in Lomboki, refused the help of international aid organisations.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombardes had to be deployed, no disaster at national level was reported, which would be a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, it has been very clear that there is no need for international assistance, so we have a slightly difficult situation" said Sumbung.
The Save the Children Foundation has already been working on the construction of a Palica sendable aid team, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will actually be able to participate in the site rescue.
Sutopo, the spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian agencies are currently conducting an assessment of the state of demand to see whether the involvement of international aid organisations is necessary.
Despite the continuing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared with the destructive power of nature.
Although it was built in Aceh provinces, it is not common in other coastal areas.
There was the same tsunami signal in force, the obvious lack of the tsunami-marking siren system in Palu has also contributed to the development of the human life-consuming disaster.
Between the Indonesian islands, transport can be difficult even in the best time.
In the event of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombe is on its way to Palu, but at least three more days before the disaster reaches the affected zone.
President Widododo has put Indonesia's campaign to focus on the development of its knock-on infrastructure and did not save costs in road and rail projects.
However, the Joko Government is now facing budgetary deficits before the elections next year.
In addition, the president must face the ongoing tensions in Indonesia, since the majority of Muslims began to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people had to die and tens of thousands of people had to be deported because of the disturbances in which Christian and Muslim gangs came to one another in the streets with carvings, bows, arrows, and other scarves.
Video: Daniel Sturridge in Liverpool is a huge equaling goal against Chelsea
At the Premier League in Stamford Bridge, London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool with his hit goal in 89 minutes, who didn't lose against Chelsea.
Trap 0-1 was lost when Sturridge was given about 30 metres from Chelsea's gate to Xherdan Shaqiri.
First he put the ball on the left, then he started a huge kick in the remote corner of the gate.
The shot was high above the sixteenth, and it was heading right to the right of the net.
The ball finally got to the net with Kepa Arrizabala.
“I wanted to get into a position only because there is always someone, such as Shaq, who advances the ball, so I tried to put myself in a better position,” Sturridge said, answering the question of LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante arrive, and I just took him off, and then I didn't think much, and I shot him."
Chelsea led to a half-time between 1 and 0 after the 25th minute Belgian star player Eden Haard's goal.
The blue battle with the corner of Mateo Kovačič gave him the ball, then he was able to break off the middle course and run into Liverpool Square.
Kovačič has started after a quick injection and got the ball back on the middle course.
Then he started home with a beautiful transfer to the sixteenth.
He ran home and finally sent the ball with a left shot in the remote corner at the Liverpool Gate next to Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet with Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadium San Paolo Arena in Naples.
Chelsea is playing against Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europe League.

The statue of Parliament's Cromwell is the latest victim of history and history rescheduling fever
The exile of the statue might be poetic justice for the destruction of the cultural and church heritage of England by the followers of Cromwell and the fanatical Puritan at that time with a Taliban enthusiasm.
According to the Cromwell Society, however, Crick's proposal is "crazy", an attempt to rewrite history.
According to the President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, “It was essential that the Oliver Cromwell statue before the Westminster Palace eventually become a target during the current discussions on the removal of statues.
During the British Civil War, the image destruction was not ordered and executed by Cromwell.
So maybe another Cromwell victimized for the actions of Thomas in the preceding century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive Cromwell charm reflects the opinion of the 19th century, and it is a historical memory that many have to celebrate even today."
In this regard, Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is perhaps less than it is today at the end of the 19th century, but many people in Parliament consider it to be the protector of external pressure, which was, of course, a monarchy for him.
The fact that this picture is indeed accurate remains the subject of a historical debate.
However, so far it is clear that this conflict in the middle of the 17th century had an impact on the further fate of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person who represents one side of this conflict.
And the results achieved as a Lordprotector are worth celebrating and remembering."
A Chinese farmer for the wounded death of a murdering pig
According to local press reports, a pig attacked and wounded a farmer on a market in the southwest of China.
With only a man identified as Yuan, he was found with a torn blood on the market of Liupanshui in Kujcsu Province, and reported on the case at South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is prepared to inject pigs with a vaccine in a farm on 30 May 2005 in the city of Xining, China in the province of Csinghah.
The man traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Jünna to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning he found her in her cousin's body and discovered that the door to the neighboring pig was open.
According to his statement, the giant candizo mouth in the swine was bloody.
According to the report, the expert study has found that the farmer is indeed a hundred pounds [250 kg] of pig to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloody, and they were broken," said the relative Guiyang Eventing News only mentioned as Wu.
According to security cameras, Yuan entered the pig house at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killing the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The leader of the market told the Eventing News that the pig has been blocked so that no harm can be done in others, while the police are investigating the trace at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are now discussing compensation for man's death.
Although not often occurs, previously reported cases of pigs attacking humans have occurred.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on their masseusets farm and caused life-threatening injuries to the man.
And ten years earlier, in Wales, a pig of 300 kilos of pigs stuck a farmer to his tractor until the man's wife was able to be angry.
After a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba spoke about the CBC News show that pigs are generally not prone to attack, but may become aggressive from the taste of blood.
"They're a great player.
Like little kids, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt you.
All you have to do is give them respect," he said.
Severe rainfalls following Hurricane Rosa in the Southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is becoming increasingly weak as the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico appear to be.
However, Rosa will continue to cause severe rainfall in the southern part of Mexico and the southern part of the United States in the coming days.
The Rosa struck with a speed of 140 km/h as a hurricane of category 1 at 5 a.m. on Sunday morning at 5 p.m. from the Mexican Punta Eugenia to 620 km southwest.
Hurricane is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low air pressure zone develops above the Pacific Ocean and goes westward towards the west coast of the United States. As the Rosa approachs to Lower California on Monday, it floods the areas of the United States of America with a heavy tropical force as a tropical storm.
On Monday, the storm may bring up to 25 cm of rain to some areas of Mexico.
Next, meeting the approaching low air pressure masses will cause tropical due rainfalls in the coming days on the southwest.
Here, the three to 10 cm rainfalls of sudden floods, axes full of floods, can cause earthquakes in the desert.
The heavy tropical pair can also produce a rainfall of between 5 and 8 cm per hour, especially in the southern areas of Nevada and Arizona.
Some parts of the southwest are expected to fall between 5 cm and 10 cm, especially in Arizona.
Suddenly, floods can occur with a rapidly decreasing strength due to the spraying nature of tropical rains.
Especially during tropical rainfalls it is not recommended to take foot in the desert.
Because of severe rainfalls, canyons can turn into spring rivers, and the zivatars are accompanied by sudden windfalls and dust clouds.
The forthcoming low-pressure masses can cause severe rainfall on the coast of South California.
It is possible to rain up to 1.5 cm, which can cause lower floods full of scrapes and flat travel relationships.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Spherical tropical ruins may be present on Sunday nights and Monday mornings in Arizona, then on Mondays and Tuesdays also cover wider areas of raining.
On Tuesday, the severe rainfall will spread to the Fourways region and last until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense temperature fluctuations in the United States, as polar atmospheres cool, but tropicals remain quite warm.
In this place, there may also be dramatic variations in temperature in short distances.
This is an excellent example of the situation on Sunday in the middle region of the United States.
Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebranska) as well as St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) are close to 10 degrees of temperature difference.
In the coming days it is expected that even summer warm will be felt again in larger areas.
In the central and eastern regions of the United States, it is expected to be warm in the first half of October, and the temperature will be around 25-30 degrees from the southern part of the Great Plain to some parts of the Northwest.
The temperature in New York on Tuesday will reach 25 degrees, about 5 degrees higher than the average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, the temperature in the eastern parts of the United States will be higher than the average temperature by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
A total of more than 20 million viewers on the six television channels were interested in the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Judge, and the female accused of rape in the eighties, Christine Blasay Ford.
Meanwhile, the political situation has not been resolved, and the broadcasters had to break the regular show due to the last-minute Friday screw: Jeff Flake managed to use the Arizona Senator to get a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told his Senate Court Committee about court cases that until 100 percent he was certain that at a high school party, Kavanaugh would take Kavanaugh and try to take him out.
In Kavanaugh's passionate testimony, he told me that to 100 percent sure that didn't happen.
The confessions were probably seen on Friday by more than 20.4 million people who were reported by Nielsen.
Nielsen used the average viewer numbers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other channels, such as PSS, C-SPA and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is difficult to measure the number of people who watch shows at their workplace.
For the sake of comparison, so many viewers are used to football players or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, which attracted experts to the deployment of Kavanaugh from all channels, had the highest average of 5,69 million viewers during the entire day hearing.
Second place, ABC stands with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS 3,1, NBC 2,94, MSNBC 2,89, while CNN was watched at 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's report.
Interest was not reduced after the hearing.
The star of the Friday drama was Senator Flake.
Once the moderate Republican senator's office issued the statement that the senator would put down thevoks next to Kavanaugh, he was seen on CNN and CBS on Friday morning, as a result of the loud crowd of protesters, as soon as he was on the elevator to the trial committee meeting.
He was looking at me for a minute, while the crowd was suffocating, and CNN broadcasted the scene alive.
“I stand in front of you,” said a woman to the senator.
– Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth before the country is public?"
Others shouted: “You have the power to do what is not done to so many women.”
Falke said only that his office had issued a statement before closing the door for the elevator, he added that he would share what he had to say in the hearing.
On cable and broadcasting channels, it was then seen live hours later, as the committee voted on whether to extend Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for the vote.
However, Falke said that he was willing to do so only if the FBI investigates the charges against the candidate during the next week, as the Democrats in the minority called for.
Flake's discussions with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, have convinced him of this need.
Flake decided to speak with the Coons and other senators later.
He has exercised his power in accordance with the decision by Flake, since it has been obvious that the Republicans will not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
Ms Theresa May, British Prime Minister, accused the opponents of Brex in political play.
In a Sunday interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of rejecting his plans for leaving the European Union of endangering the future of the United Kingdom with their political play and undermining the interests of the nation.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, will attend the Konservative Party's Birminghami conference on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to May's interview, May's former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacks May the so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, saying that the idea of handling the customs duties of Great Britain and the EU is ‘absurd’.
The Wayde Sims murder: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson by murdering the LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the 20-year-old basketball player Wayde Sims murder shooting at the Louisiana State University (LSU).
The 20-year-old Dyton Simpson was arrested for a strong start-up murder, reported the police headquarters of Baton Rouge.
The police released a video of the merger between Sims and Simpson, and they also announced that Sims' glasses fell during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene, and on it, Simpson's DNA was recorded on the WAFB network of CBS.
After interviewing Simpson, the police announced that the young man admitted he shot Sims.
According to the Advocate, the court ordered bail of $350,000.
According to the preliminary report published by the coroner of East Baton Rouge County on Friday, the cause of death is the wound that also affects the head and neck.
The office thanked the State Police in Louisiana for its special mission with the escaped criminals, the criminal lab of the state police, the help of the university police and the people in the area in the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect.
Joe Alleva, director of the LSU, thanked the competent law enforcement forces for their “serious and persistent work in finding the truth.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-meter high attackers grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also LSU's basket.
Sims scored 5.6 points per game every last season and 2.6 lepatano averages per game.
On Friday morning, LSU’s basketball player, Will Wade, declared that the news of Sims’ death was “returned” and “sucked” the team.
“A man is always afraid that something like this happens,” said Wade.
Vulcan's flooding Mexico City with ash
The ash fired from the volcano with Popocate has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
After the collapse of the volcano, and within 24 hours of total 183 gas and ash shooting, the national disaster prevention centre asked the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The centre has also observed several oscillating and vibrations.
In the images displayed on the social portal, in some districts of Mexico City, for example, in Xochilico, the windshields of cars are covered by thin ashtrays.
The geophysics observed an increase in the activity of the volcano from the Mexican capital to 72 km south-east, following an earthquake of 7.1 in September 2017 shaking the central region of Mexico.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The police are collaborating with katán separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the independence protesters hit the police and thousands joined the rival demonstrations on the first anniversary of the break-off referendum of Katalónia.
A group of high-end separatists with eggs and paint powder threw back-up patrols, so the other day, tourists' streets were covered by thick portraits.
In the later part of the day, further fights were made, during which police were trying to maintain the order with rubber.
We do not forget, we are facing each other through the classes of the sub-groups of independent groups that scan the "Live Spain" and the unit demonstrations behind the symbol "Live Spain".
According to local press reports, 14 people have been killed with minor injuries in protests.
The tension will continue to decrease in the region of independence through the referendum of 1 October of the Catalan separatists, which Madrid deems to be illegal.
The electors stood by a large majority in favour of the break-up, although the participation rate was rather low, as the majority of the Unions have voted.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people have suffered injuries last year when the police tried to stop voting in polls through aggressive conflicts.
The independence party groups were on the street all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the National Police.
Although unable to prevent it, the demonstration was finally not on the right track.
According to a 68-year-old electrician, Narcis Termes, who participates in separatist demonstrations, there is no chance that Katalón will gain independence.
“Tavaly was one of the best times in our life.
I saw my parents drop tears of joy for what we can vote for, but now our case has turned off," he said.
Although at the regional elections last December it was possible to win an important victory, even if there was a lack of victory, the Catalan independent parties are difficult to maintain their momentum this year, since many of their best-known leaders have been involved in voluntary exile or are waiting for the court to rule on the organisation of the referendum and their role in the subsequent declaration of independence.
According to the 42-year-old car maker who recorded the police protest with his cell phone, Joan Puig said that the conflict was fired on both sides of the politicians.
"The situation is getting more tense," he says.
One of the Catalan leaders who had been waiting for prior arrest since last year, Oriol Junqueras announced that the European elections would start next Saturday.
"I can mostly reject the devolution of democratic values and the repression represented by the Spanish Government if I take part in European elections".
Londonderry: The police arrested three men who drove their cars into a house
The police arrested 33 men, 34 men, and 39 years old who drove their cars in Londonderry several times into a house.
The case happened at Ballyngard Crescent around 19:30 in the summertime.
Detective Bob Blemmings says the gate and the building have been damaged.
Maybe at a given moment, they even shot the car with numbers.
Menga's goal was to hit Livingston's Rangers team by 1-0.
Dolly Menga's first goal assured Livingston victory
The newly admitted Livingston in the first class brought a great surprise to the Rangers' team by getting Steven Gerrad to his second defeat, who has been active as a coach at the ibrox club since 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's goal meant the real difference because Gary Holt's team was in a dead race with the Himernian team in second place.
Gerrards continued to remain in the current season of Scottish League without a foreign victory, and next Sunday they are faced with the first-place Hearts team, with eight points behind.
However, there is still a match for Rangers on Thursday against Rapid Vienna in the European League.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased its divisional infallibility series to six winners, which means that Kenny Miller has not yet received the Holt that turned down last month.
Livingston has missed a number of situations against an incoherent guest team
Holt's team could've gotten the lead long before the single goal of the game, as their attack game has caused little trouble to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the same enemy's defense, but he was too far behind the attack, and Alan Lithgow's attempt to get wide after he slipped in to reach Craig Halket's cross-line ball.
The home team allowed the Rangers to play their own game because they were certain that they could disturb their guests in fixed play situations.
The fateful goal was born from a situation like this.
It was a kick-off for the Rangers, and Livingston found a break in his defense, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who took advantage of it from the middle of the sixteenth.
At this stage of the game, Rangers led the same ball game, but domestic protection continued to be unbreakable, and Liam Kelly's gate was barely in danger.
This trend continued in the second half of the game, except for one situation when Kelly had to protect Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman tried to get the Rangers, Allan McGregor left him with his foot, and Lithgow took the gate from another kickout at Livingston.
The cross-directive balls have continued to arrive at Livingston's sixteenth, but the defenders have been rescinded every time, and the attack team has not received two criminals: one has been killed by the entrance to Glenn Middleton as a replacement player, and the other has been guaranteed.
"Final" game from Livingston – game analysis
Tony Macaron from Aréné means Alessair Lamont, journalist of BBC Scotland
Livingston has provided phenomenaal performance and wheels on the balconies.
Players have been fine from one to the next, and pastes beyond expectations.
The team's members and play styles have hardly changed since they returned to the top, but Holt's efforts deserve great appreciation, because he's been making the team very much worse since the coach arrived.
Several players have brought the most excellent form.
Both team captains formed a huge, well-organized defense, and Menga had a good start on Connor Goldson and Joe Worralt.
He was playing without the Rangers idea.
As well as being under Gerrard's leadership at times, they were now unable to bring that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – otherwise only once managed to break down domestic protection – so the Rangers must get together quickly, because they slipped back to the middle of the field.
Erdoñan found a mixed reception in Cologne
It was a nice atmosphere and a good pleasure to present the morning meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29) in Berlin.
This was the last day of Erdo-an's visit to Germany to improve the relationship between NATO countries.
The relationship broke between the two countries on issues relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdołan then traveled to Köln, a newly built, huge church opening ceremony.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest community of Turkish people living outside Turkey.
On the grounds of security, the police banned the gathering of 25,000 people before the meeting, but many of the supporters of the President have appeared to see the Turkish Head of State.
In addition, hundreds of protestors against Erdoñan, including many Kurds, expressed his denial of Erdo-an's policy and that the German government decided to take the Heads of State.
The two opposite demonstrations are a fine example of the sharing of the President's policy, which some Turkish-origin German citizens celebrate as heroes, while others see the Autokrat in it.

The caramel took place at the crossroads of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in the south-east of town at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the passenger car stopped, and the ambulances tried to help the bike, but he lost his life on the scene.
The impact took place only a few months after another bike hit hit was a death victim on Children Street, just a mile from where the accident took place on Saturday.

According to reports in June, the prison director had to be treated in hospital after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In October last year, special developments were also needed to help beat down a serious disturbance in which prisoners attacked the prison staff with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix with sudden flooding, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (but the situation of dry areas can improve)
Arizona is rarely reached by tropical depressions, but it is expected that this will be the case at the beginning of the next week, when the remainder of Hurricane crossed to Rosa in the deserty southern West, with a dramatic increase in the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already ordered flooding from Western Arizona to the southern and eastern parts of Nevada, as well as south-east areas of California and Utah; the preparation also affects the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Hurricane Rosa is forecast to pass straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, where he is expected to arrive on Monday night and bring great rains.
The meteorological service of Phoenixi published the following message on Twitter: “The ten tropical cyclones have reached within a 200 - mile radius of Phonenix in the form of tropical storm or depression.
Hurricane Katrina, for example, approached the border of AZ 40 miles (1967)."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict a rainfall of 50-100 mm, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, such as in the territory of Mogolon Rim in Arizona.
In other parts of the southern desert areas (Medium areas of the Scissing Mountains, Great Basin, etc.), a rainfall of between 25 and 50 mm may be calculated, but in some places it may fall 100 mm.
The rain brought by Rosa can bring relief for areas not threatened with lightning water, as the area is currently under severe drought.
Even though floods pose a serious threat, some of the rainfalls may have a beneficial effect on the southern landscapes that struggle with abscond.
According to the American drought monitoring service, more than 40% of Arizona’s territory is affected by extreme drought, which is considered the second most dangerous category,” says Weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will catch a beach on the Mexico Sub-California Peninsula for the first time.
The Hurricane will remain on Sunday morning, bringing up to 137 km/h slice, about 600 km south of the Mexican Punta Eugenia land language, and will be heading at approximately 19 km/h north.
The storm in the Pacific meets colder currents and will lose its power.
Thus, Mexican shores are expected to return as a tropical storm during Monday afternoon or evening hours.
It can be expected that raining in certain areas of Mexico will increase significantly the chances of developing floods.
“The rainfalls may result in an average of 70 to 150 mm from Lower California to the northern part of Sonora, where there may be a rainfall of 250 mm,” says Weather.com.
Rosa will then continue as a tropical storm to the north of Mexico before reaching Arizona's border during the early hours on Tuesday, in the form of tropical depression, to reach the southern areas of Utah on Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat caused by Rosa and its remains is the national Hurricane Center in Also-California, North-Sonora, and in the south-west desert regions of the United States," said the National Hurricane Centre.
The rainfalls are expected to cause life-threatening lightning waters and flow of water in deserted areas, and landslides in mountainous areas.

"Who will vote for Judge Kavanaugh, the Democratic Party will vote against the ungruntled and depraved tactics," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, the Democratic Party had to "responsibility and anger" in the nomination of Kavanaugh.
On Thursday Kavanaugh testified before Congress, where he strongly and passionately denied Christine Blasay Ford's claim that the man had committed sexual violence in decades earlier, as a teenager.
At the hearing, Ford testified and stood up to his earlier statements.

Hundreds of people died in an earthquake in Indonesia, and the number of dead is rising.
A lot of people were swept away by the price and at least 384 people lost their lives when the giant waves reached the beach. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and a fountain on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, when the local authorities declared on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival held in Palu on Friday, when the high waves of nearly six meters (18 feet) reached the coast at the beginning, they were swept away by many, and they destroyed everything that was in their way.
The escape price was triggered by an earthquake of 7.5 strength.
“When there was an explosion yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach, not running away, so the waves became a victim of the waves,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the speaker of the Indonesian disaster response agency (BNPB) at the Jakartai press conference.
“The fountain price came not only within itself, cars, logs, houses and everything else from the beach,” said Nugroho, and then added that the tsunami was moving at 800 km/h in the open sea before reaching the beach.
There were those who climbed up the ditch and fled, he said.
Approximately 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters, please.
The air footage published by the Agency from the disaster shows a number of destroyed buildings and business facilities, several congested and damaged bridges and a water-circuit.
On Saturday, more post-attacks shook the coastal city.
The earthquakes could be detected in an area of the size of which some 2.4 million people live.
According to the statement of the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT), over 200 times more energy was released during the Friday earthquake than the nuclear bomb dropped to Hirosoma in World War II.
The Agency added that the city was located at the end of a long and narrow bay and that the resulting geographical properties could confirm the impact of the fountain.
Nugroho said that the damage caused was “a significant”, thousands of houses were destroyed in the disaster, and hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
They found the body of several victims among the ruins of the damaged buildings, said, then added that the number of injured persons has been 540 and that they are looking for more 29 persons.
According to Nugroho's statement, the number of injured persons and the damage in the area called Dongdala from Palu 300 km (190 km) to 300 km (190 km) may be even greater, as it was closer to the epicentrum of the earthquake.
The communication is "fully paralyzed, unable to get information" about Donggala, said Nugroho.
“more than 300 000 people live there,” says the Red Cross communication, which also announced that the organization’s experts and volunteers are already on their way to the area affected by the disaster.
"The situation is already tragic, but could be worse", he added.
On Saturday, the Agency received numerous criticisms about the fact that it did not inform the population of the firebender Palut, but according to the management, the waves were already off the coast during the alarm.
One of the amateurs shared on social sites can be seen by a man who is trying to warn those who are on the street of the approaching fountain with a desperate cry from the upper floor of a building.
In a few minutes, a huge water wall will be trapped on the shore, with cars and buildings swept on you.
The Reuters news agency has not been able to prove the authenticity of the recording yet.
The earthquake and the flooding caused the loss of electricity, inevitably communicating around Palu, so the authorities can also coordinate rescue work harder.
The military transport of cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but according to the authorities, the evacuated population will continue to need food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city was opened only in order to facilitate aid work, and will remain closed until October for all other purposes.
President Joko Widododo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers set up on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian fountain exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Donggala to the city of Palu, where employees found shelter under tent bombs set up in the yard of the office, but during their journey they met the horrific signs of destruction, said Doseba.
“They said that they saw a lot of broken houses, ” they added.
"It's really bad."
While relief teams have been able to prepare disaster response work, some complained that foreign experts with high experience in this area could not travel to Palura.
According to Indonesian regulations, aid, aid shipments and personnel from overseas should only be admitted to the country's territory if the location of the accident is declared a disaster at national level.
This hasn't happened until now.
“The case continues to be treated as a countrywide disaster,” said Aulia Arrian, a spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
– Once the government acknowledges that it is indeed a national disaster, we can release international aid services, but no announcement has been made at the time."
On the second night after Friday's quake and fountain, Please continue to hope that your friends and family members of the missing will be among those who have been loved to save their lives with some light in the dark mood of reports about natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the canal during rescue work.
On Sunday, the workers were able to get rid of a woman who spent two days in addition to the body of her mother, who was in danger of ruins.
The coach of Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian national paratrooper team, prepared two competitors of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games completed at the beginning of the month, this time in Indonesia.
In addition to the missing persons, his other students were in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
"As a Veteran paratrooper, what happened is a great spiritual burden on me," he said.
Gendon recalled that when the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel began to spread among the paratroopers, for hours he was desperate to reach the contestants who took part in the coastal festival, please.
In addition to the messages, however, only one grey pipe appeared instead of two blue pipes.
“I think that means that messages could no longer be delivered,” he said.

Kanye West: the name of the rapper has changed to Yre
Kanye West, the rapper's name is now Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday with the following message: “The creature previously called Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old Westet has been called by Ye nickname for several years, and this was also called the eighth album published in June.
He announced the change of name before his Live on Saturday Night, where he was expected to present a new album called Yandhi.
Aria Grande is taking over her show, who, referring to the "sensical reasons", said the show's production.
The new name is not only shortening the current artistic name of the rapper – according to previous statements, it is also of religious importance to West.
“I know that “Ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “he” said West earlier when he spoke to Big Boy’s radio director about his album’s title.
So I'm you and I are and we're all the same.
Kanye means the only one, and it's just Ye, what's good in us, the evil, the confusion, everything.
The album reflects who we really are."
Ye is one of the famous rappers who change their names with love.
Sean Combs, for example, has also been running under the name P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he has now preferred the names of Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-founder, JAY-Z, also several times varied by whether his name should be written in one, a bond, or a capital.
The Mexican President agreed that he would not take the army against civilians.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexican President of Mexico, made a promise about the coming 50th anniversary of student medals in the blood bath that he would never take up the force against civilians.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador, in Tlatelolco Square, promised that “if he will not use the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire on the square to participants in a peaceful demonstration, causing the death of some 300 people, when left-wing student movements showed signs of strengthening in Latin America.
López Obrador promised to help young Mexicans – to provide a monthly financial contribution to students and to plan to establish free state universities.
It argued that the lack of unemployment and education were the two main factors that led young people into the arms of criminal organizations.
The US should double the financing framework for MI solutions
As China is becoming increasingly active in the research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double support for research in this direction, Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and adapter of solutions using artificial intelligence, who also worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said this after the US Government made artificial intelligence announcements, even though the US does not have an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, China also announced its plans: the country's goal was to become the world's first MI developer by 2030.
“ Doubleing the cost framework for MI research would be an appropriate start, as all other countries are significantly behind the US, and the next breakthrough in the area of MI is at a threshold,” Lee said.
By doubled research grants, the chance could also be doubled that in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States could take the next major step in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order”, published this month in the management of the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures. The company invested in one of China’s most important MI companies, Face+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon worked on a MI system that managed to defeat the best American Othello player and later acted as a management member of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the results of technology competitions previously announced by the U.S. government, including DARPA Robotics Challenge, and was interested in the time when such an event would take place, because at this time, it would be possible to explore new shapers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain the state aid needed for their research, said Lee.
“China does not take away the scientific leaders, but the large companies,” he added.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working on several major university skulls over the last few years.
Lee believes that the amendment to immigration policy could also help the US's efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that you should automatically receive a green card for those who have a doctoral degree in the field of artificial intelligence", he said.
In July 2017, the GOC announced its plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The national science base of China provides similar support to the staff of academic institutions, as the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and other government organisations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, explained Lee.
This year, the Ministry of Defence of the United States of America established the Joint Cultural Intelligence Center MI, where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Scientific Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next,
The NSF currently spends 100 million dollars a year to support MI research.
Meanwhile, the law of the United States of America, which designed to establish a National Security MI committee, has not taken any further action in the interests of this case for months.
In Macedonia, there is a referendum on changing the country's name
The people of Macedonia have been waiting for a Sunday referendum to see if the country's name would be changed to "The Republic of Macedonia". With this move, a decade-long disagreement would be resolved with Greece, which prevented the acceptance of the country's EU and NATO membership request.
Greece, one of whose provinces is called Makedonia, argued that its northern neighbour's name indicates that it has a claim for a Greek territory of the same name, so far it has protected NATO and EU membership of the country.
The two governments agreed in June on the state's new name, but the national sentiments say that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not participate in the referendum and, as a result of the start-up bojcott campaign, he had doubts whether the 50% participation rate required for the current referendum would be met.
The question on the polls is as follows: "Does the country’s membership of NATO and the EU and accept the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the change of names, with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price should be paid in order to enable Macedonia, as one of the emerging countries, to be able to join the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the country's future so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would be a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska (79).
Although the referendum alone is not legally binding, it is enough for a Member of Parliament to feel that the result of the vote is binding on itself.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is needed for the change of names.
According to the National Election Commission, no notice of irregularities has been received until 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, up to this point, the participation rate reached only 16%, which was 34% in the parliamentary elections in 2016.
“I came to vote for my children because we in Europe have our seat,” said Gjose Tanevski (62), who gave his vote in Skopia, the capital.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, wife, Zorica, and son, Dushko, in favour of the change of names, they were put down in Strumica on 30 September 2018 to allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In Skoppa, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage, as well as chairs and tents for the referendumers.
“We also support the country’s membership of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with a proud, elevated head, and not through the chat room,” said Kavalarkov.
– We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If we do not want to be accepted as Macedonia, then we can also turn to China or Russia as part of Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership could be accounted for with investments in Macedonia that the country with a higher unemployment rate than 20% needs.
"I think that the majority will support our cause, because more than 80% of the country's population support the EU and NATO membership," Zaev said after giving its vote.
He also added that the "yes" vote means "ensurement of the future of the country".
According to the results of a survey published last Monday by the political research institute in Macedonia, 30-43% of voters are expected to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation rate.
Another survey conducted by Macedón Telma TV is expected to result in 57% participation on Sunday.
For those who want to go to the vote, 70% of them said they'd be there.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation rate should be at least 50% more than one vote.
The inefficiencies of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the West Party government, which came to power in May last year.

Scherzer wants to make the Rockies work harder
Since the Nationals team missed the opportunity to enter the post-season season, they had no reason to work hard.
But Scherzer, who is always a competitive spirit, can't wait to be on Sundays against Colorado Rockies, but only if the enemy team still has a chance to play. Rockies are a gamer's advantage to Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West baseball League.

Trump in West Virginia campaign
The president also pointed to the situation of the Supreme Judge, around Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke of the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“In November, everything we have done has been at stake.
We're only five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the greats, I'm not going in person, but I'm leaving in essence, so I'm going anywhere to support the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “Everyone can see what these terrible, radical democracies are doing with their own eyes.
They are truly committed, and they are capable of taking any means to regain their power, to see malpractice and sublime.
It doesn't matter who they're hurting, who they're going to kill to have control in their hands, they're going to have power, they want control, and power, but we're not leaving ourselves."
According to the President, the Democrats are putting in the 'absence and obstruction'.
"They could have seen all this in the last four days," he said, "satisfied and angry and low and lying", calling the Democrats.
According to the name, he mentioned Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Committee on Criminal Affairs, whose hearing he declared a loud decline in the gathered crowd.
“ What else did he say?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what?
No, no, no, wait – all this with very bad body language, that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
It's not tolerating people who say what they think they're saying.
I wasn't surprised at all when the activists of the Momentum decided to censor my censorship.
Finally, I am only the last one in the long line of the Labour Party Members who have been told that they are not welcome, simply because we have said what we think.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way for being unbridled against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship didn't like me to agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
In addition, the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which are ironically the issues in which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
At the invitation of the Labour Party meeting held in Nottingham East on Friday, they wanted to have a “intelligent and productive meeting. ”
Most of my eight years as a local representative of the Labour Party, these Friday evening meetings were exactly the same.
Today, however, sounding has changed, and the promise of a policy of more "serious, more polite" has been forgotten if it has ever been achieved.
It is more and more noticeable that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and all opinions are considered acceptable for the party's leadership.
This trend began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple. My colleagues with whom I thought we had a similar political attitude have been more and more often expected to turn their back on my individual opinion and take a position on things that I would otherwise never agree with, whether it be national security matters or the single European market.
After all my public talk, regardless of what I have said, they are starting to waste their lives on the social fronts, they demand my resignation, criticise middle-aged policy and tell me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
This isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am much happier than many of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me tend to affect politics.
I admire the profile and determination of my political colleagues who are forced to stand up to sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, but they are not running away.
The most disappointing aspect of our politics today is that such level attacks have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn was talking last week about the task force having to support the culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we have given up diversity, and with all the initiative of "inadmissibility", and with all the amendments to the electoral rules, there is a growing gap in the party.
Over the past few years, many have advised me to hold back, not be so literal, and then "all will be fine".
However, that is not why I have taken political action.
32 years ago, I joined the Labour Party as a student, because he was upset that the Thatcher government had neglected schools so much that our classroom was almost inflamed and then fought for a better close-up, as a local adviser and government minister for the most deprived.
I never put my political views under the toilet, nor did I do anything else during the last election.
In Nottingham East, it was quite clear to everyone what political positions I represent and on which I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who have supported this motion on Friday, I would like to say that, in this situation, when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will not only harm families, but companies and public services, I do not understand why it is necessary to spend all the time and energy to question my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
My most important message, however, is not for the members of the Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, regardless of whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that any threat to change or to politics will not hinder me from acting in my own judgment and in the interests of everyone.

Ayr–Melrose 38-17: Ayr breaks to the top unbeatably
Two late attempts have been changed somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr will be able to win the deserved victory of the day in the most amusing match in Tennent’s Premiership.
The team is currently on the top of the table, alone of the ten teams.
Thanks to their virtuous defence and their use of the negligent position, the Hungarians and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We had to meet a great challenge during our games, but we are still unbeatable, so I have every reason for happiness,” he said.
Robyn Christie, the player of Melrose, said: “We need to know that Ayr has made much better use of his situation than we do.”
With Grant Anderson's experiment in 14 minutes, from which Frazier Climo made a point, Ayr has been given an advantage. Thanks to the yellow paper for Captain Rory Hughes's Scot, loaned by the Warriors, Melrose could have made the difference, however, the attempt by Jason Baggot did not make a point.
Climo was a criminal who was sweating the Ayr's protection, right at half-time, then obtained a point from a single experiment, so the first half-life ended up in favour of Ayr.
Melrose started the second half of the time, selling Bagggot to five points, reducing the disadvantage of the team.
Then the game stood for a long time, as Ruaridh Knott suffered serious injuries and had to be taken off the track, and Ayr further increased its advantage by trying to get Stafford McDowall, whose bets were managed by Climo's involvement.
Blair Macpherson, the Captain of Ayr, received a yellow card, and Melrose managed to prevent Bruce Colvine's experiment in a man-made machine, thereby breaking the pressure on them.
The home team started to catch again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for putting Climo down without the ball, MacPherson introduced a touch down behind the Ayr attack team.
Climo sold what Kyle Rowe just said after the reboot, when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kick, and sent Gregor Henry to go home to try five.
The star of Still Game has started a new career in the catering industry
Looks like one of the stars of Still Game, Ford Kieran, moving towards the catering industry: it was revealed that a restaurant was in the lead company.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvist plays in the popular series of BBC, written together with his old comedian Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next 9th will be your final season, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he became the director of the Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't comment on the news, although Scottish Sun's source indicated Kiernan was trying to benefit from the "Glasgow's flowering catering industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without the coast hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Marine Command, decorated with sailboats, is patrolled in La Paz.
There are ocean flags in the centers.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaa to Amazon announce the following motto: “We are on our way to the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
The memory of the lost coast in Bolivia, which has not been at sea, was taken in a bloody conflict of the 19th century with resources, and has a strong desire to re-establish the waves of the Pacific Ocean.
For decades, these hopes may have been the most powerful one, because Bolivia waits for the judgment of the International Court of Justice of October, which will close for five years.
“The ball in Bolivia is flooded with the spirit of unity and peace, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
There are many Bolivian observers following the decision of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Hague Court will stand next to Bolivia, and Chile will be required to sit at a meeting table after several decades of rapsodistic attitude so that Bolivia can have its own access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic, native President of Bolivia, who is looking forward to a conflicting fight, which must continue for the reelection of the next year, will be lost much with Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific” announced at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court would probably not decide for Bolivia, and that would not change much if its decision was positive for Bolivia.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands does not have the right to judge the areas of Chile and has also concluded that it will not affect the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was born only six months after the closing remarks indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a chilei expert in international law.
Moreover, the last four years have not helped Bolivia's case, but he even took it back.
“The issue of the sea exit was addressed by the current Bolivian Government for its own purposes,” Záte explained.
"The good news of the rest of Chile has gone away because of Morales' hostile rhetoric."
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one point, but after what has happened, it will be extremely difficult to initiate dialogue.
The two countries have not delegated ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, representative of Bolivia in Havana, disagrees with the finding that the court ruling would have been unusually rapid.
For Bolivia on Monday, “an exceptional opportunity to open a new chapter in relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “come well from the closure of the 1339 years of conflict,” said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would have used the maritime debate to make it a political advantage.
“Bolília will never give up her right to the Pacific Ocean, ” she added.
"The judgment gives us the opportunity to see that it is time to go beyond the past."
North Korea: no nuclear arrest until they can trust America
According to North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho, his country won't be first to take down nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
Ri Saturday spoke before the United Nations Assembly.
He called on the United States to uphold the promises made by the leaders of the two rival countries at the Singapore Summit.
The comment was made when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was already able to reinitiate the ongoing nuclear negotiations more than three months after the summit with the North Korean leader Kim Dzsongun.
According to Ri, "I'm sorry" to believe that the US obstacle to continuous sanctions and the Korean declaration of war will ever be enough to force North Korea to kneel.
Washington will continue to accept the declaration if Phenjan does not take significant steps towards the decontamination.
Both Kim Dzsongun and Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, wide-ranging scepticism calls Phenjan's commitment to putting down the arze, which is probably the only key to the country's safety.
Pompeo plans to visit a phenjani for the next month so they can prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion show shows the huge headphones that will soon appear in top-class shops
If you want to expand your hat collection or want to cover the day completely, you don't have to search anymore.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headgear as part of their spring/summer collection in 2019, which was accepted by the stylish audience of the fashion week in Paris with great enthusiasm.
Not known as practical hats produced sensations on Instagram during the summer, and the above fashion designers also put their noticeable works on the runway.
Valentino's most spectacular piece was an oversized beige hat, which was pendulum-like, wide carmine decorated, and almost completely swallowed up the head of the models.
Among the other oversized supplements were published in expensive greeks, a magic base, and, in fact, a pineapple that was not really designed to keep the human head warm.
Thom Browne also came up with a bizarre choice of masks, just before Halloween.
Most of the colored masks had their mouth sewn together, and they reminded me of Hannibal Lectre rather than the haute conture.
One of them was like a dive mask with a pipe and glasses, and one of them looked like a melter's ice cream.
If you come in with these spectacular pieces, you're lucky.
Style analysts predicted that huge hats may already be on their way to upper class clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path that was taken by La Bomba, a 60 cm wide caricature hat we've all seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the narrowly practical hating of social sites showed another piece on the runway: the beach cover made of a skirt, which is almost as large as the bathing suit model to be held.
The dark orange tarp – which is decorated by rascals and on top of it has a white leather coat – was one of the outstanding pieces of the Jacquemus/Syri La Riviera collection in Paris.
The star stylist, Luke Armitage, said to FEMAIL: “I am counting on the fact that by next summer huge hats and beach bags appear in the upper category clothing shops. The designer has triggered an elemental effect on everyone that it would be difficult to deny the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: knowledge of language is essential for world citizens
In view of the new high-level test results, this situation has not changed until 2018, which is further enhanced by individual and group success in sports, arts, music and other Community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students learn in such institutions, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which seek to provide the best possible services for students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen careers and their position as citizens of the world.
In a educational sector where there is the possibility of designing and introducing customized school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak in a language that you understand, it will reach your head.
But if you speak in his tongue, it will reach his heart."
This is an important reminder because we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relations and trust with those from other countries.
This year’s exam results show that students from independent schools have produced the best results from foreign languages throughout the country.
68 per cent of all students studying foreign language achieved a higher degree A (85 per cent of results).
Data collected from the SCIS 74 member schools show that 72 percent of students received a higher degree in Mandarin language, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French and 63 percent of Spanish students achieved A.
These results also support the fact that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be an essential knowledge that will undoubtedly need to know children and young people in the future.
Today languages as selected objects have become at least as important as natural sciences, technology, technical sciences and mathematics, both independent and other schools.
In 2014, the UK Committee on Employment and Vocational Training survey showed that 17 percent of employers believe that filling empty positions is a problem due to lack of language awareness.
This also shows that language knowledge becomes increasingly necessary to allow young people to pursue a successful career.
Since more and more jobs expect knowledge of foreign languages, language knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
No matter what kind of career someone chooses when learning a foreign language, he acquires a long - term knowledge from which he has a clear advantage.
The ability to communicate directly with other nationalities automatically provides competitive advantages to those who speak more than one language.
According to YourGov’s survey, where 4,000 adults were asked in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents could not speak well enough in any foreign language, and France was the only language spoken by more than 10% of respondents (15 percent).
That is why it is important that we are still focusing on the teaching of children in languages.
Talking in several languages, especially in developing countries, can be a tool in children’s hands, which can make it easier for adults to apply for more important work.
In Scotland, every school will have different languages.
Several schools will focus on classic modern languages, while more languages will be taught, such as Mandarin or Japanese, which are expected to be of paramount importance to the United Kingdom by 2020.
Whatever the area of interest of the child, you will be able to learn more optional languages at independent schools and train teachers who are experts in your territory.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and supplies them with the skills they will need to succeed, keep whatever the future is.
It is not difficult to see that, in the current global business environment, languages remain vital for the future of a country, and this education must also reflect.
As a matter of fact, knowledge of modern languages should rather be treated as “national communication skills”.
Independent schools offer choice, diversity and quality education opportunities for the young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire – this is how it has to be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron in San Diego will introduce you to Lakers on Sunday
You don't have to wait a long time for the fans who seem to be sitting around to see LeBron James take the first step in Los Angeles Lakers' colors.
The Coach of Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play the presiding round against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you'll be on the track is a questionable one.
"More than one, and less than 48," Walton wrote on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers scientist, Mike Trudell, said that James would probably play for just a limited time.
After a few days of training, James was asked what his plans were with Lakers in the six-minute pre-seven season.
“I don’t have to play at this point in my career in the first season to be ready,” he replied.
Trump West Virginia campaign and YouTube channel
Donald Trump Wheeling, West Virginia, will begin the long series of campaign events tonight.
This will be the first of the five invaded events of Trump next week, including stops such as Tennessee and Mississippi supporting him.
Now that the election of the President of the Supreme Court has been postponed to fill his vacant seat, Trump is trying to collect supporters for the next half-time elections, as there is a risk that the Republicans will lose power over Congress when the votes take place in November.
When does Trump start tonight's Western Virginia event, and where can you be followed online?
Trump wheelingi (Nyugat-Virginia) will speak tonight, i.e. on Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7.
You can also follow Trump's Western Virginia meeting online through the live YouTube media.
Trump will likely be affected by the hearing of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh this week, which proved particularly tense in the light of sexual harassment charges, and the confirmatory vote of the Senate was suspended for up to one week until the FBI is investigating.
However, the primary objective of sudden repressive events is to help the Republicans in their situation before the November elections.
According to Trump’s campaign advisor, next week’s five events are “the activation of voters and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority currently held in the Senate and the House of Representatives”, says Reuters.
"In order to be able to control Congress, its political plans are so critical that the President is visiting as many states as possible.
The event planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, “You can also bring supporters from the States of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and you can also enter the reports of the Pittsburg media,” says West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, it will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit Western Virginia, the state where he won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help his Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who, according to the survey, is not in a favourable position.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must personally intervene in order to be more involved in the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: The American team is in full range in front of the Sunday individuals to keep hope alive
After three unilateral attempts, on Saturday afternoon's four-day matches, the Ryder Cup needed a great deal.
The brightest shirt of luck and the moment's present is a sports concept from the very air, yet every player believes in it, mostly in competitions like the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
"They had six points and only four advantages, so we can say that we have the ball," said Jordan Spieth, walking away at the end of the day.
Of course, four points still lead Europe, and another twelve can be obtained.
The Americans, as Spieth tells, feel that they have finally received a small backslide, and can draw encouragement from all kinds of things, including Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and they both score three points out of four.
Spieth proved to be infallible from the start to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
His noble triumphs were becoming more and more pronounced as he went forward with a critical spin and a balance in the fourth match, so he and Thomas were in double disadvantages after two.
The game decision-making has led to a cry of joy like the 15th hole, a kind of kind that can believe with the viewer that the American team is not all lost.
“It’s just to dig deep in yourself, and only to take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
That's exactly what's still waiting for players.
18 holes for the chance that you'll leave a trail.
Over the past two days only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular couple in Ryder Cup, could score more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe has brought four out of four out of love, and it seems that they cannot make mistakes.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who did not meet the bar on Saturday afternoon, and Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning at the last nine stages.
Thanks to the dynamics of this series and the dynamics between them and the people that support them, they became the measure on Sunday, and nobody expects the sun to secure Europe's victory in the National Course of Le Golf, such as Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best thing would be to win one at a time, with different holes in it.
However, it would be early to celebrate the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were soon executed in Sergio García, the fourth hero of the morning when Alex Noren and Alex Noren played together.
One time and twice over the bar, the first nine holes were carried out by Spanish and Swedish, which put them into a roller valley where they had no chance to climb out.
On Sunday, there will be no one to help me out of your hole.
Four-ball games and four-game games are extremely fun to look closely thanks to the interaction between couples. You can watch out who gives advice, which you don't give, and how the strategy can change within an eye.
Europe has so far played as a better team, and it has a significant advantage for the last day, but this section four has shown that the U.S. team has many people who lack them, especially on the American side.
Europe begins the last day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 advantage
Europe can start the last day of the Ryder Cup with a great advantage after Saturday's four-ball and four-ball match with 10-6 results against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the hair by taking two wins against the weak Tiger Woods, thus raising the difference to four points on Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, which is trying to recover the trophies lost in the case of the Hateltine two years ago, dominated the continuous U.S. team in the morning in four-ball matches, winning 3-1.
America has shown greater resistance in the fourth round, bringing two games, but they can't get the difference down.
Jim Furyk's team should get eight points from the 12 individual games Sunday to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first newcomer in Europe who won four points in series, while he and Molinari, who only mentioned as "Molliwood" after a sensation weekend, the second pair of the history of Ryder Cup, which gained four points on four opening games.
After they beat Woods-Patrick Reed in four balls, their great team game was defeated by unmotivated Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau for a firm 5&4.
Woods, who was so attracted to two games all Saturday, sometimes even lauded his talent, but he lost 19 out of 29 games in four balls and fours, seven of which.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning four-balls, returned to Henrik Stenson, and by 2&1 in the fourth, he was defeated by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third pair of world-classists.
However, Europe did not succeed in this pleasant, warm day, from Paris to the south.
The three-time address protector Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans how to do this on Saturdays.
A embarrassing 2&1 win is drawn against the pair of Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four balls and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIllroy in 4&3 ratios after they lost the first two holes.
In the history of Ryder Cup, only twice was a team able to come back from the four-point disadvantages in individual competitions, although Fury's main defense team is enough to keep the trophies.
However, after two days only being the second best one, a Sunday counterattack seems quite unreal.
"No way" is to unilaterally reduce North Korea if you do not trust your negotiating partner.
North Korea's foreign minister informed the UN on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions only increased the mistrust of the United States of America and that under such circumstances the country would unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jongho said at the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea had "stated and high-level actions" during last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile experiments, closing the site of nuclear experiments and making a promise that it would not expand its nuclear arsenal and scope of nuclear technology application.
“ However, we do not see similar responses from the Americans, ” he said.
– Without confidence in America, we feel that the safety of our nation is not ensured and, in such circumstances, it is not possible to unilaterally and first off."
Although Ri has again expressed North Korea’s disappointment regarding Washington’s opposition to the idea of a “specific” nuclear arrest, which, in a scenario, would receive North Korea’s rewards for the measures taken so far, his declaration did seem significant, because he did not clearly reject unilateral nuclear pollution, as Phenjan has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Dzsongun and Donald Trump at the very first summit between the US President of power and the leader of North Korea, which took place in Singapore on 12 June, and in which Kim promised to work on “the nuclear disposal of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump guaranteed the integrity of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to formally take place at the end of the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States considers that Phenjan must give up his nuclear weapons first.
Washington did not allow strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“America insists that we start with nuclear arrests, and it increases the pressure on us to force his will, and it also protests against declaring the end of war, ” said Ri.
– The idea that sanctions can force us to kneel is the desire of those who do not know us.
The problem is that non-reflecting sanctions only increase our suspicion."
Ri did not mention that he was planning a second summit between Kim and Trump, but the President of the United Nations spoke separately at the beginning of the week.
The minister pointed out that three meetings were held between Kim and the South Korean President Mun Dzsein in the last five months and said: "If the country concerned with nuclear destruction were South Korea, not the United States, the nuclear disposal of the Korean Peninsula would not have been in such a situation."
Nevertheless, Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year's when he said at the UN General Assembly that the aim of the North American continent is inevitable with North Korean missiles, after Trump, “the evil president,” Kimet called himself a “rare man” who is on a suicide mission.
This year, in the UN, Trump, who threatened the North Korea with a “total destruction” last year, has lauded Kim with praise that he has the courage to take steps towards the decontamination, but also noted that there are still many work left and sanctions remain until North Korea executes nuclear equipment.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there was no time limit, that is, "if it takes two years, three years or five months, no matter what."
China and Russia also argue that the UN Security Council could reward Phenjan for the steps that have been taken so far.
On Thursday, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said: “The sanctions of the Security Council must be unmistakable until we have reached the actual, final, proving nuclear arrest.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea in order to reduce the financing of Phenjan nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Rivé during the break of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would return to Phenjan next month to prepare the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not been well.
After leaving Phenjan in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea accused North Korea of bringing “gensterious claims”.
In the course of the meeting with Munn this month, North Korea promised to launch a missile base and a nuclear facility, if the United States also takes "the necessary steps".
According to Mun, the “several steps” Kim mentioned would be security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore or steps that could lead to normalisation of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are trained to rest enough
The University of Harvard is a new subject this year that students have been cornered for more sleep, thus fighting against the growing culture of masquerading all night long with caffeine.
A academic has concluded that students of the world’s number one university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care about themselves.
The course, according to which the first such training in the United States was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who was teaching sleep medicine at Harvard Medical College and practicing as a doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
It encouraged the development of the course to give a presentation on the impact of sleep loss on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only now, being a senior?’
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleeping, which was surprising," he told Telegraph.
During the first course this year, students describe the fundamental impact of appropriate sleep patterns on their learning and sports performance, apart from having a positive impact on their general public interest.
According to Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard University of Medicine and director of the University's Health Service, the university decided to launch the course because during the week students were found to be extremely unsatisfied.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
For example, one shows a picture of a college room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, gym shoes and books to get acquainted with the effects of caffeine and light, by the effect of sports performances that are influenced by unsalableness and why the bedline routine is important.
In another section, participants will be described how long-term sleep loss increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
They present their maps of the university territory with interactive icons to allow participants to think about daily routines.
“We know that we will not change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to such knowledge, as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture in which it is considered to be power to learn one night continues to flourish, he said, adding that the increasing pressure on modern technology and students leads to increasing problems of sleeplessness.
Sufficient and high quality sleep is the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even obesity, as sleep loss makes the brain hungry and causes a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler in the design of the course, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and biophysics, and last year he took one of the professor's courses at Harvard.
He said that they heard his eyes open there and encouraged him to be swordned in addition to launching a university level course.
It hopes that as a next step, postgraduate students will be able to participate in a similar training program before moving to the competition area.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a warning to the bed, a alarm to the awakening, and to meet the adverse effects of the electric screens and LED light sources, which can easily defrost them from the daily rhythm and make it difficult for them to sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1-0: Menga beats Gerrad's men and gets a goal
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb hit Steven Gerrard in defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
The ibroxis tried to get their first alien victory after the 4-1-th victory of St. Johnstone, but Gerrard had the second defeat of Gary Holt's team in 18 games as manager, leaving the Ladbrokes Premiership (the Scottish Championship) in the first place from Hearts.
Menga hit me seven minutes before midnight, and his unmotivated Rangers team hasn't even had access to the equation yet.
While the Rangers slipped to sixth place, Livingston landed on third base, only because of the difference in the goal, being left behind by Himernian.
In addition, Rangers may face additional difficulties after the coastline, due to Calum Spence's head injury, was required to provide medical care thanks to an object that was likely to be dropped from the sight of the guests.
Gerrard turned eight points on the team that got into the front of the Betfred Cup by sweeping Ayr.
Holt's going into the Livingston track with the same 11 people who took a spot from Hearts last week, and he would have been happy to watch his team's set-up team suffocating his opponent's game where he was.
Although the Rangers were driving in a ball game, Livingston took him more with what he got.
The first two minutes ago you could've got a goal when you first started giving Menga Scott Pittman to the gate of Allan McGregor, but the midway player couldn't sell the switch.
Keaghan Jacobs landed on Craig Halket's team captain, but his protective partner Alan Lithgow found only the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control of you, but there was more hope in their game than confidence in the last third.
Alfredo Moreelos clearly felt that he deserved a criminal at the 15th minute when he was in contact with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson could handle his Colombian complaints.
The Rangers only had a shot at the first two half-life gate, but the former ibrox captain Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibally's head and the weak shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's attempt was to face the game in the 34th minute, no one can deny that they deserve a chance, just for their hard work.
The Rangers have re-suspensioned a piece of Jacobs' spoiled flag.
Scott Arfield didn't react in time when Declan Gallagher put the ball on Scott Robinson, who found Menga perfectly for the easy ending.
Gerrard decided on the break, Couliballyt Ryan Kentre switched it, and it almost immediately developed the effect of the game when the windy Morelost jump, but the impressive form of Kelly was blocked in time.
Livingston continued to reach the point of playing a game that was right for him, and Lithgow and Halket swept up long balls each other.
Holt's team could have had a greater advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor had a good grip on the net and hit Jacobs' position before Lithgow was in the middle of a nail.
Glenn Middleton, who was in charge of the Rangers' exchange, tried to fight another eleven when he and Jacobs got stuck, but Thomson couldn't be convinced.
Almanach: inventor of the Geiger account
A detail of the “bath day breakfast” of our apple brother: 30 September 1882, just 136 years ago... the day of the later physics, Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a invention that could lead to the creation of a tool known as Geiger.
Since then, Geiger has become one of the basic tools of science and thanks to the film Bells of Coronado, the film entitled Roy Rogerst and Dale Evanst in 1950:
Man: "What is this miracle?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger accountant, looking for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put this headphone on, you can hear the sound of the atoms that are released because of the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Listen to me, he's a bit of a bug."
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 just a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, in the invention of a woman who owns a name, she lives longer.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” the abnormal cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy abnormal cells.
A vaccine that has been given as part of treatment teaches the immune system to detect abnormal cells.
It is part of the method that immune cells should be removed from the patient and then modified in a laboratory.
So they can “see ” the protein that is accompanied by a variety of cancers, inject the treated immune cells back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has achieved promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who has been treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect abnormal cells may have said goodbye to ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is the extraction of immune cells from the patient; their modification in the laboratory to "see" the protein called HER2, which is often accompanied by various cancers; then the replanting of cells.
Jay Berzofsky, professor of the American National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine in our possession.”
The HER2 "stimulates the growth of various types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and limb cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method based on highlighting immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has already been successful in treating one of the type of leukaemia.
The play of Kanye West SNL, who holds the MAGA hat, has been brought to the attention of a Trumpot supporter.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye Westet was plucked in Saturday Night Live's studio after an inconsistency manifestation of American President Donald Trump and then told me that he would apply for the President's post in 2020.
After he gave out his third song that night in the boot of Make America Great Again, Ghost Town, he began to speak against the Democrats, and again he stressed that Trumpot would support.
“In many cases, when I speak to someone who is white, he asks: ‘How can you like Trumpot because he is racist?’
If I were interested in racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show was opened by Matt Damon on a parade in which Brett Kavanaugh, the Hollywood Star, had a glamour in connection with the sexual harassment charges of Christine Blasay Ford, made before the Senate Justice Committee.
Although it wasn't released, the video of West's speech video was uploaded to social sites by Chris Rock's humorist.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of West with the upload.
West was even complaining to the audience that he was being plucked behind the scenes because of his hat.
"They scared me behind the walls.
They said "don't go out in that hat".
They scared me!
And they said that I was in the first place," said Washington Examier.
West continued: “Do you want to see a new place? I take my Superman coat, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to progress?
Try with love."
His manifestations were accompanied by at least twice by a flute from the audience, and the SNL performers were apparently embarrassed by one of the witnesses who said to Variety: “The whole studio was mute in silence.”
Instead of a singer named Westet Ariana Grande, she was invited in the last minute, with a friend of Mac Miller's rapper who died a few days before.
West also asked questions when he dressed his I Love song as Perrier glasses.
Westet is the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, in a chat: “One of the most courageous spirits is to be called, ‘ HOW TO DO THEM."
Karen Hunter, host of a conversation show, said that West was simply “herself, and that's great.”
“But I have decided not to reward someone (with the purchase of music or fashions or with the support of “art”), whom I believe they possess and distribute ideology that is harmful to the community I belong to.
He's free.
But we did, too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, now he is “the creature known as Kanye West.”
He's not the first artist to change his name, and that's how Diddy went into the prints we know as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and P. Diddy.
Rapper's partner, Snoop Dogg, also recorded the name Snoop Lion, and, of course, the former legend, Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist known as Prince.

Kit Harington, star of the Throns' battle, finds the prolonged manhood harmful.
Kit Harington is most known as Jon Snow's Battle of Thrones, and in the climax of HBO's violence, he often takes a sword himself.
The 31-year-old actor, however, spoke against the stereotype macho heroes, highlighting that such heroes may often feel that hard action is necessary to fight respect.
Who, in her statement to The Sunday Times Culture, said that "any one was wrong" and raised the question of how the problem of the harmful effects of over-emergency can be addressed in the #MeToo era.
The star who recently married his 31-year-old serial colleague Rose Leslie said that it would be very important to remedy the problem.
“ Am I personally affected enough — how did this matter become so distorted in manhood? ” the actor asked.
– What have we taught men when we were kids about the problem we are facing now?"
Kit believes that television is responsible for the spread of the distorted image of manhood, since the programmes often feature masking characters.
He added: “What was born with us, and what is our lesson?
What does the street and TV tell young boys that makes them feel like they can only be men in this way?
I think that is one of the big questions of our day – and how we can change that.
'Cause obviously something's not right with young men."
Who said in the interview that after the summer season of the series, Tronok Harca will not be included in the series of events or flows, because “it is food from battle spaces and horses.”
From November, Kit Sam Shepard will play a major role in the reprocessing of True West's film, which is about a producer and his life - style brother.
The actor told me that the best thing he got from the Thron's fight was his wife Rose, who he met during the show.
“I met my wife on the set, so I could thank my future family and my life before me for the series,” said Kit.
Rose Ygritte, who had the love of Kit's character Jon Snow in the Emmy award fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's Scottish family property.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new patients increased by 14% in China
China has announced that 14% of HIV and AIDS citizens in the country have increased.
According to health officials, this represents more than 820,000 stakeholders.
Only during the second quarter of 2018, the number of reported cases increased by around 40,000.
Compared to previous ones, a change is that a significant majority of newly infected individuals are exposed to the disease sexually.
The disease has spread rapidly as a result of the transfusion of previously infected blood in some parts of China.
At a conference in the province of Jünnan, health officials said, however, that the number of such cases has been reduced to almost zero since then.
Nevertheless, compared to the previous year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS increased by 100 000 in China.
Transfer of HIV by sexual means is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against society has been very strong since then.
Based on estimates in various studies, 70 to 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men end up married to women due to the conservative value of the country.
The disease spreads in these relationships in many cases due to inadequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has provided universal access to anti-HIV medicines as part of the problem-solving programme.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of his staff would have leaked data from Republican senators, condemning "hazard lies" and "controversity theories".
On Saturday, American MP Maxine Waters rejected the charges that a member of his staff published the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia site of the senators.
According to Commissioner Los Angeles, these claims were distributed to experts and websites on the right-hand side.
“A lie, a lie, and even more low lies,” wrote Waters on Twitter.
The information reported was reported to include the address and telephone number of Senator Lindsey Graham, South Carolinian Senator and Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information was released on Thursday on the Internet, but the publisher is not familiar, but is certain that they were made public about the Catolium domain, during the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court candidate for sexual harassment.
The leak happened shortly after asking the three senators Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages, such as Gateway Pundi and RedState say, can be linked to Waters' office as source, and they also reported information about one of Waters's staff, says The Hill.
“These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars,” Waters continued.
– My staff is not responsible for leaking information. However, the right to anonymity, the protection of personal data and security has been injured due to fraud and lying charges.
These charges are completely unfounded, false, and obviously lying."
The statements made by Waters on the Internet were quickly put to criticism, including Ari Fleischer, the former press secretary of the White House.
“It’s an angry rejection,” wrote Fleischer.
– On this basis, Waters does not seem to have the blood temperature required for his representative's office.
If someone is suspected of something he didn't commit, he can't react angryly.
You can't be daft.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
You need to stay calm and calm."
Waters' reaction was apparently compared to the reaction of Judge Kavanaugh to the democratic criticisms of parties, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, who is a Republican candidate for the seats of Waters in the mid-term elections, has also shared his opinion on Twitter.
“If it is true, it is serious” he wrote in his message.
Waters wrote in his communication that his office informed the “competent authorities and law enforcement bodies” about false charges.
“We must ensure that the perpetrators are identified – continued Waters – and that they are legally held responsible for all the acts that endanger or damage any of the members of the staff.”
Johnny English will strike again, or Rowan Atkinson's paralysing spy game
Today, we have been allowed to look for references to Brexit in every British film, and there is no exception to this Frenchman, who is under Johnny English, who is a category of action playing/parodia, which is not the first part of which Johnny English in 2003, the second part of which was recharged by Johnny English in 2011.
Will sarcastic, paraducating satirs become a new export product of the British nation, in which we are living on our own, obvious upheavals?
There is so much doubt that the garbage-cracking, rubber-crazy, incompensated Johnny English had enough uniforms for a new return – it is clear from the name that this comeic character has been created to make it laugh in the movies of non-English native-speaking countries.
Johnny English is, of course, a secret agent who thinks he's the winner of his bizarre motivation, so reminds me of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and occasionally of the guy who contributed to the performance of the Fireskers' main title at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
The character is also originally based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson once played in a long-time forgotten Barclaycard commercial, and he left chaos everywhere.
There's a good moment or two in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved the way Johnny English dressed in medieval armor approached a helicopter, and then the rotors knocked on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson's comedy veins are very valid in the film, but the humor of the film doesn't really work, and it doesn't even seem superfluous, because these days, the "colosive" Frenchs like James Bond movies or the Mission Impossible series are a brave way of reaching the sense of humor.
To feel that the humor of the film is aimed at children rather than for me, Johnny English has managed his adventures, which have failed to reach the level of idealism and genius that Atkinson brings in the silent scenes of Mr. Bean's series.
The starting point for the film is eternal: Great Britain is in grave danger.
A cyber criminal broke into the super-secret network of the British spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents to the biggest terror of the client, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately only got this small role in the film.
This may be the last angle to the coffin of the colossal and sharing prime minister, whose political popularity is in ruins anyway: Emma Thompson practically makes Theresa May, and to which everything is otherwise poorly written.
The intelligence advisors will tell him that, since all active agents have been found to be present, he has to put a resting agent on the job.
This restless agent, of course, is the one who has worked as a teacher since his withdrawal as a teacher in an advanced school, but instead of teaching children spy on children, here are, of course, funny scenes, while he presents the basics of spying to the English “Rocksuli”.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where the emergency briefing will again meet with his former, well-damaged weapon carrier, Bough, who is now played by Ben Miller.
Bough has been married since then, and also married the captain of a submarine, whose mouth is always in the ear – the captain is Vicki Pepperdine, who called on to play a much better role.
Thus, the double party of His Majesty’s national security service, “Batman and Robin,” again, will be in action and will face Ophelia Bulletova, who is the beautiful woman of Olga Kurylenko, as well as a true destiny.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is becoming increasingly enveloped by the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve the digital problems of Britain: his name is Jason Volta, and Jake Lacy is developing.
English and Bough will begin their clowning mission: they will set fire to a waiter in the middle of a small French restaurant, and then in the middle of an amazing turn, they will smuggle themselves into Volta's luxury yacht, and English will actually free the hell when you try to get to know Volta's apartment using a VR-head.
We need these stations to get to the end of the story, but whatever fun and turn-down it was, it might make a little too much of the impression of a child movie.
The end result is rather mediocre.
As with the other Johnny English movies, the question has just been raised: can the British film industry finally give Rowan Atkinson a gift?
The British Labour Party denies having a four-day job while paying the British for a five-day job.
Jeremy Corbyn's working party is working on a radical draft: the introduction of four-day work week, with employees working for five days' salary.
The party is alleged to want workers to benefit from the industrial intelligence (MI) revolution by providing company leaders with an extra day off thanks to increased income.
According to the draft, workers would receive a three-day weekend while they would take us home as much as they have before.
According to the sources, the idea would be ‘a proper’ to the party’s economic programme, which aims to spread the language of the balance sheet on the workers’ side of the country.
It also supports four-day work week's idea of trade unions' Congress, so they think that workers could benefit from the changing economy.
One of the leading officials of the Labour Party reported to the Sunday Times: “At least before the end of the year, the policy review will be announced.
Although it will not happen one day, but the four-day work week will be an idea that fits well into the party's programme, which would spread the weight to the workers in the economy, and also fit the party's comprehensive industrial strategy."
It would not be the first Labour Party to support such an idea, campaigning the Green Party in parliamentary elections in 2017.
The idea, however, does not enjoy the support of the whole Labour Party.
He said: “The working week of four days is not part of the policies supported by the Party, and the question is not even on the agenda.”
Mr McDonnell, shadow finance minister, last week at the Labour Party conference, presented his idea of a socialist revolution affecting the economy.
McDonald said he was determined to regain the power of "innocent directors" and "responsors" of the resident companies.
If the shadow finance minister's plans were to be implemented, the shareholders of water service companies would not receive the full profits they were due, because a worker party government would use "loss" as a punishment for the alleged harmful activities.
McDonald also confirmed that he was planning to make workers a member of the board of directors and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds that would group 10% of the shares of private companies to employees who could thus obtain 500 important dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy have been told in the 60 Minutes show whether the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh can change their opinion
As a result of the FBI investigation of the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote on the election of the Supreme Judge of Kavanaugh will be held at least a week later than the original date.
In his interview "60 Minutes" on Sunday, Scott Pelley's journalist John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked Republican senators if the FBI could find anything that would change their mind.
Kennedy was less committed than his colleague in South Carolina.
“ I understand, of course, ” Kennedy said.
- That's what I said before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called after the case went out, and I asked, "Have you done it?"
Your answer was firm and clear."
But Graham's vote seems to be concrete.
“I have already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and would need extremely serious charges to change my mind, ” said Graham.
– Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett strongly denied his claims,” added Graham, named Christine Blasay Ford.
– And none of the persons named by Dr. Ford have been able to justify the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don't think anything new will turn out."
What is a Global Civil Festival, and have you managed to reduce poverty?
The annual music event, the Global Civil Festival, will begin on Saturday, New York, and world stars will appear at the festival to stand up for a truly noble purpose: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Civil Festival will now be held seven times, expected to be spent tens of thousands of Central Park's Great Place, where participants can not only enjoy the performance of Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also draw attention to the real purpose of the event: the eradication of the deep poverty by 2030.
The Global Civil Festival was first organised in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is operated by an international interest group aimed at eliminating poverty by involving more and more people in an active fight against poverty.
You can receive free tickets to the concert (unless you are willing to pay for VIP tickets) for certain tasks or "deployments", such as voluntary work, e-mail to a leading politician, a telephone call or any other valuable activity to draw attention to the project: eliminating poverty.
But how successful has a global citizen been in achieving the goals set over the last 12 years?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with concerts to convince others about the importance of action, or is it just another form of so-called "coldctivism" when people feel that they really contributed to an online petition or wrote a Twitter message?
Since 2011, global citizens have reported that more than 19 million "actions" have been carried out by project supporters, which have served a number of different objectives.
According to the organization, these actions contributed to the allocation of 37 billion dollars by world leaders to policies and commitments against poverty, which could affect more than 2.25 billion people's lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed 390 commitments and announcements that their actions had come from, 10 billion of them have already been paid out or collected during the fund collection.
The group estimates that the amount of money collected has had direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between investors and contractors based in the United Kingdom, which aims to help children “to achieve the potential of their children".The organisation promised Rwanda 35 million dollars to help eliminate hunger after receiving more than 4700 Twitter messages from "global citizens".
"With the support of the UK Government and donors, national governments and similar global citizens, we can ban social injustice and malnutrition among the footnotes of history books," explained Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also claims that, after more than 5000 actions have been requested by the United Kingdom to improve the food of mothers and children, government resources have been allocated to the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the diet of 5 million women and children.
One of the often repeated questions published on the website of the Global Citizens is: “Why do you think the deep poverty can be eliminated?"
According to the reply of the Global Citizens, “It will be a long and difficult journey, which sometimes means we will fail and fail.
But like previous civil rights and anti-segregation movements, we reach our goal, because together we are stronger."
Among other things, Janet Jackson, the Week, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae will attend this year's New York event, and the programmers will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Minister for Foreign Affairs: US Navy "blocking" to prevent Russian energy exports
"If necessary", Washington would introduce the Navy against the entry into the Russian energy market, such as the Russian energy could not reach the Middle East," quoted Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of Interior at Washington Examier.
Zinke claims that Russia's active presence in Syria, particularly as regards Russian operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian government, is just an excuse to get Russia's new energy markets.
“I believe that they are only there in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe and the southern part of Europe,” Zinke said in a statement.
And according to the Minister of Interior, there are ways to prevent Russians.
“The United States of America is able to ensure that maritime routes are open and can include blockades, if necessary, so that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” Zinke said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the non-profit event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance – the non-profit group also defines itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington's action on Russia and Iran in his speech and noted that it was practically the same methods.
"Iran and Russia can be sanctioned economically in the same way: using existing energy sources and introducing new ones," Zinke said, while he called Russia the "one-dimensional economy", pointing to the country's dependence on fossil energy sources.
The statements coincide with the plan of the Trump Government to export liquefyed natural gas to Europe, thereby reducing Russia from the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Therefore, the leading officials of the Trump government, including the President, will convince Germany to back off the "unfair" line project called the Northern Stream 2, which, if implemented, makes Germany "a hostage" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the existing capacity is being doubled, thereby increasing to 110 billion cubic metres, a $11 billion Northern Stream 2 line only by an economic nature project.
According to the Kreml, Washington is against the project with such intense economic considerations, which is the manifestation of unfair competition.
"I assume that we are in the same position as energy should not be used for pressure, and that consumers should be given the opportunity to choose their suppliers", said Alexander Novak, Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with the US Minister for Energy Rick Perry in Moscow.
The attempt to convince the Americans went backwards because Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German industrial association (BDI) has asked the US not to intervene in the EU's energy policy, as does the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I consider it a problem when a third state intervenes in our energy affairs,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Association (BDI) Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin after his last meeting.
Senator Elizabeth Warren Massachusetts is “consideringly” to start for the Presidency in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren masseusets said on Saturday, after the half-time elections, that he would "consider" himself to take office for the presidency.
Warren Massachusetts, at a holyoke city meeting confirmed that he was considering the departure.
“It is time for women to enter Washington and fix the bad-working government, and it is time for a woman to become president,” said Warren, according to The Hill.
– After 6 November I take serious account of going for the Presidency."
At the town meeting, Warren was critical of Donald Trumpot, and he said that he said "he's taking the country in a bad direction".
"I pay serious attention to the concern Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," said Warren.
Warren literally criticised Trumpot and Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court candidate.
In a Friday Twitter message Warren wrote, "Oh, of course, there's a need for an FBI investigation before the vote."
However , based on a survey published on Thursday , the majority of Warren Massachusetts voters do not think that Warren should start for the Presidency in 2020 .
Based on the study by the Political Centre of Suffolki University and Boston Globe, 58% of Warren's "good chance" voters believe that the senator should not start for the Presidency, while
32% of them support Warren's presidential mandate.
According to the survey, the majority of those questioned would support Deval Patrick's former presidential candidate, 38%, and 48% would object.
Among other things, the names of high-ranking democratic politicians, such as former Vice-President Joe Biden, or Senator Bernie Sanders, have emerged in relation to the Presidential election in 2020.
Based on the Associated Press report, Biden will decide whether to leave until January.
Sarah Palin Track Palin at Donald Trump's PTSD meeting
26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after he registered in September
On Monday night, he was arrested for assault in the family.
“What my son is going through since he came home, I understand other families who experience the terrible consequences of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are going home with,” said Sarah Palin, at the meeting of the audience in Donald Trump Oklahoma.
Palin’s son was arrested as “the elephant in the room” and said that his son, like the other war veterans, “removed, he came back hard, and he kept on thinking that he would have due respect for the service of his fellows, pilots, and all other members of the army for the country.”
Track Palint was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska for the violence against a woman in the family. Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police, said that Track Palin, in a report, committed armed violence in the family.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. support judicial review of asylum policy
18 Member States and Washington D.C. are also in favour of a judicial review of the new American asylum policy in which those who escape violence by gangs or within the family are not allowed asylum.
On Friday, representatives from 18 different Member States and Washington D.C. wrote an expert letter to support a asylum seeker who attacks politics in court, writes the NBC News.
The full name of the applicant of Grace v Sessions, initiated by the US Civil Society in August against federal policy, has not been made public.
According to the applicant woman, she was abused by her partner and the “sons of this violent crime”, but on July 20, American officials rejected her request for asylum.
She's being kept in custody in Texas.
Prosecutors of the countries supporting Grace El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have been described as places where many asylum requests from the United States have been made, as violence by the criminal groups and domestic violence in these countries is a constant problem.
The new American asylum policy has withdrawn the decision taken by the Committee on Immigration of Immigrant Appaals (BIA) in 2014, whereby immigrants who are not registered for violence within the family may apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Washington, D.C.'s attorney general, said in a Friday communication that the new policy would "be ignored by several decades of state, federal and international law".
“In accordance with federal law, all asylum applications must be dealt with in accordance with the facts and circumstances applicable, and such a barrier violates this principle,” says the expert letter.
The prosecutors also explained in the letter that the policy against immigration would harm the American economy, since immigrants would be more likely to become entrepreneurs and "to fill the lowest level of employment."
In June, Advocate General Jeff Sessions instructed asylum courts not to grant asylum rights to victims of domestic violence and crime.
“Immigrant rights leave your country for reasons of race, religion, national origin, belonging to a specific social group or because of a well-founded fear of persecution or persecution,” said Sessions on 11 June.
Asylum has not been invented to solve all problems of people worldwide, every day and every day, whether they are of any serious nature.
A desperate rescue operation in Palu, the number of dead has doubled, rescue patterns are racing with time.
The situation of survivors is becoming more and more unpredictable.
“ Everyone’s very tense, ” says Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, while resting her febrile little son, the disaster struck Palu in one of the evacuation centers.
- The ambulances bring the bodies a minute.
We barely have a drink."

The man’s eyes were light when he recalled the way the fifth floor hotel room, in which they were occupied with their wife and daughter, and the destroyer’s upskirts.
“There was no time to run.
I think I needed to be among the fallen walls – said Haris to Associated Press and then added that his family came to town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accused China of taking propaganda advertisements to the country
The Chinese Ambassador of the United States accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the US press. This happened a week after an official Chinese newspaper was published in a U.S. daily newspaper which highlighted the mutual benefits of American-China trade relations.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to his announcement in China Daily Des Moines Register, Iowa’s largest copy issue, while accused China of attempting to intervene in the US Congress elections of 6 November. China denies the prosecution.
Trump's claim that Beijing is trying to intervene in the American elections, according to some American officials reporting to Reuters, is a new stage in the growing efforts against Washington China to put China under pressure.
Although it is not unusual for foreign governments to promote trade with their country through advertising, there is an ever more intensive trade war between Beijing and Washington, during which new and new customs duties are being imposed on each other's imported products.
According to American and Chinese experts at the beginning of the commercial war, Chinese customs in response have sought to target exporters of States in which Trump and Republican Party are popular, such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the Chinese Ambassador of the United States and Iowa's former governor for several cycles, said that Beijing was harming the American workers, farmers and businesses, Iowa's country to export a significant amount of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in his opinion in Des Moines Register on Sunday, that "He is still agitating our country by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
“The Chinese Government takes advantage of the great American tradition of freedom of speech and press by spreading propaganda in paid advertisements in Des Moines Register,” said Branstad.
However, if we go to a Beijing press firm, we can hardly find critical articles. The Chinese press does not reflect the different, different views of Chinese people on the growing growth prospects of the Chinese economy, as the media is under strict control of the Communist Party in China."
Branstad added that “One of the most famous magazines in China refused to publish his article, but he did not name the newspaper.
It is recommended that the Republicans move female voters before half-time elections with the Kavanaugh-botr
It is estimated that many high-level Republican politicians will be able to defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, in the cross-border defence of sexual harassment charges, in particular with the support of female voters, which may be lost before the mid-term elections.
The case triggered intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly declared that they would continue to vote on Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be remedied – says Grant Reeher, a politician working at the University of Brussels Maxwell School, in a Saturday article in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts about the fact that the FBI investigation launched by Senator Jeff Flake Republican Arizona at the last minute will be sufficient to reassure the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – neither tomorrow nor in November” said a Washington, D.C. newspaper, Karine Jean-Pierre, head of the Progressive Group MoveOn and national spokesperson on Friday.
According to Mik's report, on Friday morning, in the Senate hall, some protestors scandaled, “The November”, because despite Dr. Christine Blasay Ford's statement, the Republican Justice Committee decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation", said Stu Rothenberg, independent political analyst.
“So many people say that it has already been extremely high, and that is true.
But it may be even higher, especially among the suburban insecure female voters and young people (18-29 years old) who, although not enthusiastic about the President, often do not go to vote."
The analysts have already assumed before Ford's public statement that he could strike back the Republicans if they continue to stand by Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. Since then, Ford described in detail why he accused the Supreme Court candidate of sexual harassment.
“The Republican Party was wrong on the ground,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Commission at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This is not only about the vote and the final vote, but also about whether Kavanaugh is going out, but also about the way the Republicans handled the case and how Forddal acted", Mr Cecil, U.S. Director for the election of Democrats, stressed.
However, it seems that Americans have quite shared the fact that Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony is true. Kavanaugh believes little more than Ford.
Based on the new survey of YouGov, 41% of respondents believed in full or rather Ford's statement, and 35% of respondents responded to Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of respondents say that Kavanaugh probably or surely lied to you in his statement, while only 30% of the respondents believed this.
The FBI is currently examining the authenticity of Ford's claims, as is the case with another defendant, Deborah Ramirez.
During a week ago, Ford confessed to the Senate Justice Committee that at his 17th year of age Kavanaugh, he was drunkly harassed by Kavanaugh.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his sex organ at a party in the 1980s when they both studied at Yale.
A world-wide inventor would launch a new Internet to face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will start a round with the aim of bringing up the competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solidra.
With Solid, users can choose where they want to store their data and who can access certain information.
In his exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he was joking that the intention behind Inrupt was “the acquisition of the rule over the world”.
“We have to do this now,” he said.
"It's a historic moment."
The application, using Solid technology, enables people to create their own "personal online repository", also known as POD.
This may include lists, list of items, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify from the same browser at the same time.
In the personal online repository, it is unique for the user to decide fully who can access your data.
The company states that "the exercise of self-determination rights of persons over data".
According to John Bruce, the CEO of Inrupt, the company's task is to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the contract developers working on the project or a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, world technology developers can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt side.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team do not ask "Facebook and Google to introduce the whole-change technology, which would put the business models of companies all over the other day".
"We don't need permission from them."
In a post published on the Media on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “delivery of commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solidra network.”
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at Massachusetts University of Technology.
Berners-Lee has participated in discussions on the neutrality of the Internet in recent months.
Despite the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am absolutely optimistic about the next era of the world network" added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann Viktória, minister of World War I, was celebrated
The only Viktória baptism he received was an Anglican priest's hometown 100 years after he carried out his heroic act in the first World War.
In the course of the attack in Belgium and Lehacourt on 29 September 1918, Mr Vann was awarded the medal.
Four days later, however, a sniper killed him, so he could never know that he earned the highest honor of the British armed forces.
The two grandchildren of the Memorial who were prepared for his honor were exposed to the Saturday celebration in Rushden, county of Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that the Memorial was “symbolic” after exactly the work of his grandfather for 100 years.
According to London Gazette, Bernard Vann was “in the middle of a thick fog and hot cannon and machine gun ” on Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 to be respected and grounded.
Later, he rushed into the face line, and with “premium heroism” he stood on the head of the flag, and then he was only rushing into a campbed arrangement, destroying its three members.
Bernard Vann shot a German sniper on 4 October 1918 — only one month before the end of the war.
“I know that I can never reach what my grandfather did, and this taught me humility,” he said about his grandfather, 72 - year - old Michael Vann.
After the retreat led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have been crowned with the Memorial.
Michael Vann said it was an honor to have a part in the celebration and said: “The vision of a true hero shows how many people later express their respect.”
The OCTs have been rushed all night to see the transmission of the Bellator 206, instead of having Peppa pigco.
Imagine that he's been up all night to watch the exciting Bellator 206, and that the mediation is missing.
The San José show had 13 collisions, the six of which were broadcast live as part of the main competition event in the United Kingdom on Channel 5 channels.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to fight each other, England's viewers were not a little surprise for the game instead of Peppa pig.
Many of them have made this difficult for them to stay up until dawn because of this conflict.
Instead of MMA games, a child drawing film was classified by one of the fans as "all kinds of sick jokes" on Twitter.
“The public regulation has no longer provided for such content at 6 o’clock in the morning, so they had to switch to children’s programmes – said Dave Schwartz, the leading vice-president of the Bellator’s communication and marketing department.
- Yeah, it's Peppa, it's pig time."
Scott Coker, president of the Bellator company, promised that in the future, the schedule of the program would be revised to take account of the audiences in the United Kingdom.
“I think that by repeating, we can solve it,” Coker said.
But since it's 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, until Sunday, which is Monday, we can't fix the situation.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the show turned on, there were many messages, and so most of them were not very friendly.
At first, we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix the mistake.
But it wasn't about that, it was about the problem of law.
However, I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
Instead of six, there will only be five matches in the program – we would have wanted to do it very much for the viewers, but we have counted ourselves.
It was an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's sexual orientation with a minority complex
Tom Daley's M.O.P. said that at his youth, he felt lower than everyone's sex status, but that's how he motivated him to succeed.
According to the 24-year-old athlete, until high school, he didn't realize that "not everyone" was like him.
In Radio 4 Desert Island Discovery's radio show, Lauren Laverne told the programmer that she was looking for gay rights to give others a “hope. ”
She added that since she was a parent, she's less interested in the Olympics.
The permanent programme leader, Kirsty Young, who has lived for many years, has left him for several months due to his illness.
Daley, invited as a “shipbreaker” at Laverine's first show, said that as a youth, he felt “less” than anyone else, because “in fact, he was not accepted when someone loved boys and girls too.”
He said: “To this day, the feeling of inferiority and strength is what I am building up for endurance and strength to achieve my success.”
He wanted to prove that he too is worth “what” so that he would not disappoint everyone when light became of sexual orientation.
The double Olympic Bronzeer Monographer became a well-known representative of the LGBT Community and, taking advantage of this year's role in national community games in Australia, asked the world governments to decriminate homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said he spoke about the matter because he felt lucky that he could live his life openly, without negative consequences, and that he wanted to give others “the hope. ”
The three-time world champion said that "the situation was totally surprising" when he fell in love with another man, Dustin Lance Black, who first met in 2013.
Daley and the Oscar winner who was 20 years old with him were married last year and claimed that the age difference never meant a problem among them.
“If you go through so many things when you were young,” he said, “as he was 14 years old, and his father died three years later in cancer,” he found it hard in his own age to find someone who had similar extreme experiences.
The couple adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June.
“ If they asked me that question last year, I would have said the most important thing is to win a gold medal, ” she said.
But you know what I realized? There are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal, Robbie."
The child's name was Robert after Dale's father, who died in 2011, when he was 40 years old, after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
According to Daley's statement, his father didn't want to accept that he would die, and one of the last questions was whether the tickets were already available for the London Olympics in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first row.
“I was sick to answer him that ‘Dad, you will no longer be in the first row’, ” he quoted.
“I was holding his hand when his breathing stopped, but until the moment I couldn’t accept that my father was not vulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and got my brooch.
“I realized that this is what I dreamt of all my life: to jump in front of an audience in the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling than this,” said.
The number of Heather Small Proud (Büske) helped him greatly during the Olympic preparation, and until today, she will be a butterfly if she hears it.
The Desert Island Discs starts on Sunday, local time at 11:15 p.m. on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson wasn't in shape, and he was on a bench on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
U.S. Phil Mickelson can set a record by taking part in the 47th cup on Sunday, but he has to win back his form if he doesn't want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in his memory.
He's playing the Mickelson record for the 12th time at the two-year event, due to his performance in Saturday's four-ball and four-year-old games, but he sent Jim Furyk's team captain on the bench.
Instead of being at the centre of events that attract five winners in big competitions as many times as they had to fight for the victory of the United States, now, in one half of the day, the team is suffocating, practicing the other half and trying to correct the flaws of its game.
The 48-year-old player is not really on the short track of Le Golf National, where the high grass has to pay a very high price for the flawless blows.
And if the track itself wasn't scary enough, Mickelson will be facing the exact Francesco Molinari English champion who won all four games with Tommy Fleetwood this week.
If Americans start with a four-point background before the 12 individual matches, then Mickelson's game can be crucial.
Furyk claims to trust the player, but what else could he say?
“He is fully aware of the role he played in today’s development. He smote my back, scratched me, and promised that he would be ready by tomorrow, ” said Furyk.
– Very confident.
It's one of the biggest, and he's done a lot for the team in the past and the past week.
I mean, basically, it wasn't two games for him.
I was planning more, but in a situation like this, we decided it was the best solution.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
With Mickelson's Sunday role, he's gonna break Nick Faldo's record, and no one's ever played more games on the Ryder Cup.
This allows you to block a series of Ryder Cups that are far behind the player's individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 winnings, 20 winnings, and seven tiers, but Furyk has pointed out that the presence of the veteran player is also of no tangible benefit to the team.
“A funny, sarcastic, spiritful, loves to play games with others, great team members, ” he explained.
– I think younger players enjoyed the games against them, and it's good to see that.
His presence is beyond the play in the strict sense."
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, is aware that they can easily lose their gain
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if someone gets a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, it can easily turn its back on him.
The Danish player was first introduced in a 1997 Valderramai match, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage against the Americans, and then at the end of the day, they were able to keep a hairline advantage in terms of winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“We must always remind ourselves that, in vain, we received a great advantage in Valderrama, but we only won one hairline, and we also had a big advantage in Brookline, where we finally got out,” said Bjørn, after the 5-3 Friday and yesterday victory in class 2018, which led to 10-6 on Le Golf National.
– We have enough to think about the competitions of previous years, and everyone can see that the game is not over yet.
You'll have to play with full force tomorrow.
So go ahead and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the points are on the board.
We have our goal, which is nothing more than winning this trophy, and that's all we have to focus on.
As I said earlier, I am most concerned with the 12 players of our team, but we must also look to the other side, who are, by chance, one of the biggest players in the world."
Bjørn, proud of the team’s hard performance on the track, added: “I would never be able to make predictions in such a situation.
Tomorrow's a whole different noodle.
Then everything depends on the individual performances that are completely different from the team game.
It feels great to play in a couple when things go well, but when you stand on your own, you'll find out in every way what kind of golfer really is.
That's what you have to explain to the players that tomorrow they'll bring the best out of you on the field.
They have to cut off their partner, who will also have to make the best form of it."
Unlike Bjørn, the captain of Jim Furyk, the opponent's team is explicitly confident that his players will do better in individuals than in couples, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who score three out of four.
Furyk personally experienced both sides of the last day's resurrection: he was a member of the winning team in Brookline, and the loser was on the side of the European team's "Medinah Wonder" mentioned bravoir performance.
“ I remember every goddamn word, ” she replied, “when she was asked, because she encouraged the players before the last day, the team captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
– We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we are on the best of a quick start as we saw in Brookline, as we saw in Medinah.
If one of the teams really gets into it, it puts a lot of pressure on the opponent's players during the middle game.
Accordingly, we have set up the order and prepared our players so that they can do a real miracle tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of turning the job into an attempt to turn the job, and Rory McIllroy is playing against him in the first game, and then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next, as the first half of the European team.
“I have also decided in addition to the order because I think that it is the same as the picture from the beginning to the end,” Bjørn added to the individual position.
Once again, Germany's latest warship has been postponed
The latest fragat of the German Navy should have been put in service in 2014 to replace the age-old Cold Warships, but because of various system failures and the exponentially increasing costs, it is waiting for you at least for next year.
The brand new Baden-Württemberg flagship was postponed to the first half of 2019 by the opening of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the Die Zeit weekly, referring to one of the military spokespersons.
According to the initial plans, the ship should have joined the Navy's commitment in 2014 but the ongoing delays have made the fate of the major project very difficult.
In 2007, the Navy ordered the four Baden-Württemberg class ships to replace the Bremen class fragats.
We know that it will be equipped with a large-fired cannon, and various missiles against air and water vehicles and disguised technology, including a signifier that will reduce the ship's radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature of the need for less maintenance, which in practice means that these latest frugals can be put in service for up to two years away from the mother’s wrists.
However, due to the ongoing slip of the project, these high-tech warships, with which Germany could feel its power over the sea, may be obsolete when finally they are put on duty, noted Die Zeit.
The difficult F125 fregat was published last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the vehicle and sent it back to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time the Navy sent back a ship delivered to the manufacturer.
There is little information about the causes of the return, but the German media is a number of critical "soft and hardware flaws", which make the warship untapped in a combat attack.
Software deficiencies are a very significant problem, as only 120 sailors will serve on the Baden-Württemberg warships, half of which are crews of the old Bremen Class.
It has also been shown that the ship is extremely overweight, which undermines its performance, and it is impossible for the Navy to make further changes later.
The 7000 tonnes ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ is said to be twice as difficult as German ships in the World War II.
Apart from the flawed parts, the overall cost of the project increases, including the training of the crew, is an increasing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an amazing amount of EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) while the initial draft was EUR 2.2 billion.
In view of the particular importance of the new Frerets problems, it is warned that the presence of Germany's marine presence is diminishing.
Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the National Defence Committee of the German Parliament, recently acknowledged that the Navy ‘go away from the available warships’.
According to the civil servant, the problem in the meantime has become a self-sufficient process, since old ships had to be installed, but no more ships could be replaced by demises.
He expressed his concern about the fact that even one of your Baden-Württemberg-class freaks could not join the bond of the Navy.
National Trust is searching for the secret life of bats
New research is being carried out on a Scotlandn property, which aims to find out how bats use the nature of the landscape while hunting.
Researchers hope that the results will provide new information on the behaviour of single flying mammals, which can also benefit from future racial initiatives.
Scientists of National Trust for Scotland will examine the behaviour of ordinary and soprano midwives and brown long-tailed and water-brother bats in the Inverewe Garden area in Wester Ross.
At the appropriate points in the area special reception facilities are put in place to record the activities of bats during the season.
NHS’s employees and volunteers will carry out mobile data collection with manual detectors.
A detailed analysis of the sound recordings can determine the frequency of bats and what kind of species they are doing.
Researchers are also preparing a habitat map and report to determine in detail how animal behavior depends on the landscape.
Rob Dewar, the NTS conservation consultant's hope is that the results will reveal the most important habitats for bats, and what species uses them.
This information will help to identify the beneficial effects of habitat management work, such as the design of trails, and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and other relevant species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom the size of bat blood populations has decreased significantly over the past century.
Building sites and territorial development work disrupt animals’ sleepplaces and reduce their living space.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also a risk factor for them, as are certain chemical procedures used for airbags, construction materials, and attacks of domestic cats.
The bats are actually not completely blind.
However, because of their nightly predator, they rely much more on their hearings when they hunt for their preaching, nothing to see them.
Their sophisticated techniques based on ultrasound reversion can determine the exact position of insects and of the fields that are going on their way.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historical buildings worldwide, 38 gardens and 76 000 acres of land, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
They work with ten trained professionals who regularly conduct studies and sleep-time studies and participate in rescue work.
The organization has created the first and only dedictable dentereves of Scotland on Threave Birts in the area of Dumfries and Galloway, which provides eight of the ten bat trees in Scotland.
According to David Thompson, the area is an ideal place for bats.
“Here inThreave they have a great place for bats, ” he said.
– There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that is needed for a good living space.
But we don't know much about bats, and thanks to work here and in other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel great."
He also highlighted the importance of verifying whether bats live before building renovation, since the destruction of a single site could result in the destruction of 400 female and young individuals, which could lead to the death of the entire local population.
The bats' protected animals, their destruction, their harassment and their place of living are prohibited by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, asked for the help of the population.
He said: “There are still many things we don’t know about bats, and we have almost no information about the situation of most populations.”
Ronaldo denies charges for rape, and his lawyers sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo described charges for sexual violence against her, and in his view others want to use her name to “report to the public”.
The football lawyers are ready to sue the German weekly form, Der Spiegel, on charges.
A member of the Portuguese framework and the Juventus Battle were accused in 2009 of rapeing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to the woman, the athlete paid her $375 000 to listen to the case, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo, after the accusations went into the sun, announced a few hours in an Instagram Live Video with a 142 million fan camp that the news was “truth.”
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
The ones I was brought together today are all lies," said the camera's five-time goldball player.
"They want to use my name to get into public knowledge.
It happens.
They want to be famous with my name, that's the life of the public.
I am a happy man, and my life is fine" – the player added with a smile.
Because of the claims that have been called "inadmissible, suspicion of privacy", Ronaldo's lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel, says Reuters.
According to Christian Schertz's lawyer, the player's claim for damages will be "for moral damages, to the extent appropriate to the gravity of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years."
The incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in one of the Las Vegas Palms hotels and casino suites.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went up to the sports suite where the man was anally raped woman, standing in the papers submitted to Clark County District Attorney's office in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo was on his knees after the incident and told him that he was “a good boy in 99 percent,” except for a single percentage.
According to the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo acknowledged that he had established sexual relations with the woman, but he believed that all this was done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police, and in a hospital she also had a vision of her injuries, but later went into an out-of-court settlement, because she was “fearing from depravation” and“recognition.”
The 34-year-old woman now wants to repeal the agreement, as the trauma caused by the case in question continues to make her life worse.
Ronaldo was right before confirmation at the time of the alleged attack (real Madrid was placed in Manchester United's team), and this summer, the giant in Italy, Juve bought the player for 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom will “be treated forever” the loss of car factories
The United Kingdom will ‘be treated forever’ if the world leader lost his position as a car manufacturer after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Enterprise.
He then added: “I am concerned” the statement by Mr Toyota UK to the BBC that, if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, the car factory will be forced to temporarily stop production at the potato factory near Derby.
"We need the deal," Clark said.
According to the Japanese car manufacturing company Brexit, jobs can be lost due to delays at the border.
The Buranstoni factory unit, which manufactures the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150 000 cars last year, which exported 90% of them to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that, if the United Kingdom falls out of the EU at the end of March, production stops will take place at the factory", said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Tokyo Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers operating in the United Kingdom (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) expressed concerns about the possibility of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, declared that after Brexit, it would close the Oxford plant of the Miniket manufacturer for a month.
Car manufacturers are most concerned about the risks associated with the supplier chain in the case of an agreed Brex.
The company’s production line works on a ‘open time’ basis, the components arrive at 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the United Kingdom and in other EU Member States.
If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without agreement on 29 March, it is the industry's representatives who believe that there may be a risk of production delays and part-time shortages.
The company's plant in Derbyshire said it would be impossible to store more than one day enough parts, so production should be stopped.
Clark said that the plan for future relations with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, was “prepared to avoid delays at the border.”
"We need an agreement. We want agreement under the best possible conditions, with which we can not only enjoy the fruit of our current successes, but also offer new opportunities, in its BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
– It is not only Toyota, but also other producers who can confirm that we definitely need to keep our highly successful supplier chain at the moment."
Toyota could not tell you how long production would be, but it warned that the cost of the company could in the long run undermine the competitiveness of the factory, which would eventually result in the loss of jobs.
According to Peter Tsouvalris, who has worked for 24 years at the Hamburg plant and is currently active in the representation of the Unite trade union, the union members are increasingly concerned: “I feel that we will never be able to recover the jobs that are going to expire at this time.”
One government speaker said: "We have developed a precise and feasible plan for future EU relations."
They can postpone Trump and Rosenstein's meeting again, told the White House
"You can postpone" Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump's high-ranking meeting, since the debate around the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues to continue, the White House announced in the communication on Sunday.
Mr. Rosenstein will monitor Robert Mueller's work by a special prosecutor who will examine the Russian influence on elections, the possible connections between Trump's advisors and the Russian government and the possible obstacle of justice by Trump.
In Washington, he's been thinking for months if Trump is finally losing the Deputy Attorney General, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk.
According to this monthly announcement of the New York Times, Rosenstein considered that he would arrive at the meeting in a wired manner so that he could record the discussion with the president, and the question was also raised as to whether Trump could be replaced on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refused to speak.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, and the rumor was to present his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then present before the United Nations in New York City, was announced Thursday.
Trump said that he would go to Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed, so as not to run into the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women suspecting him of sexual sin, Dr Christine Blasay Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into the charges brought against Kavanaugh, with further delaying the final Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made a visit to Fox News's Sunday show.
When asked about the Rosenstein Summit, he replied: “We do not have a designated date until now, or even for this week, but I see a chance of another one-week delay in the light of the Supreme Court cases.
We'll find out soon enough, and I will, as always, notify the press."
Some journalists, however, accepted this statement as follows: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The director of Chris Wallace asked me about this reason.
Sanders replied that the rareness of press conferences was not the cause of the resistance to the behavior of television reporters' "sustainable desire for repression", but said: "I do not dispute the fact that they are truly sensational hair."
He then indicated that direct meetings between Trump and press representatives would be more frequent.
"The president gave interviews for more questions than any former president," he said. He added, even without supporting the claim, "We looked at the numbers."
Press conferences will continue, said Sanders, “If the press has the opportunity to put its questions directly to the President of the United States, it will be better in the light years than talking to me.
We are often trying to do this, and in the past few weeks a number of such events have taken place, so that, instead of the White House press conferences, you can talk to the President of the United States personally."
Trump responds regularly to reporters' questions when he leaves the White House or at public events, perhaps at press conferences, with visiting dignity.
But press conferences alone are rare.
Why, perhaps it is possible to conclude what happened this week when the president, in New York, produced a bizarre role in front of the assembled journalists.
The head of the health wallet has sent a letter to the EU staff of NHS Scotland for concerns related to Brexit.
The head of the health wallet expressed in writing the country's gratitude to its staff from the countries of the European Union and stressed that he hoped that they would remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom was expected to leave.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs associated with the application for permanent residence of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations on exit between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued, which are expected to take place in the autumn.
The UK Government also agreed to prepare a scenario without any agreement.
I am aware of the worrying time this may be for you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the efforts made by each member of the team, regardless of the country they come from.
Workers from different EU Member States and other countries will be assisted by valuable experience and expertise in the work of the health register, which will also have a positive impact on patients and our communities.

Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after he had a head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, carried out an emergency surgery after he had a head injury from Mike Organ Tennessee on Saturday against the Vanderbilt Commodores team.
The director of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, declared to the journalists that the damage had taken place shortly before the midterm.
"He walked out to the coastline, and it just fell," said Reed.
The training team and members of health staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen and then put it on a barrel and took it for further examinations.
One of Tennessee State's competent authorities in Nashville in Tennessee said to Chris Harris, the WSMV reporter, that Abercrombie was beyond the surgery that was carried out at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “he still cannot provide further details about the type and extent of the injury,” while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury took place.
Abercrombie, a second-year student who's been resting for a year, spends his first season in Tennessee State's team, where he's been certified from Illinois.
On Saturday, he presented five successful gears before leaving the track, so he'll be at 18 in season.
Foreign customers will have to pay higher fees for the properties purchased in the United Kingdom
According to Toryk's new plan, foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees for the property purchased in the United Kingdom and would support homeless people with the additional income they receive.
To neutralise the success of Corby's young voters by this step
The increase in fees is aimed at those who are not taxed in the United Kingdom.
According to the Treasury's calculations, this would amount to EUR 120 million per year, which would be used to support homeless people.
Foreign customers will have to pay a higher fee for the properties purchased in the United Kingdom, and the additional revenue resulting from this will be used to support homeless people, and there will be an announcement at Theresa May's press conference today.
The aim of this step is probably to counter the success of Jeremy Corbyn among the young voters, which has been achieved by promise of more affordable housing and high income measures.
The increase in the tax will affect individuals and companies who are not taxed in the United Kingdom and will be used to combat homeless people.
The additional fee to be added to the current fee, which can be calculated over the higher fee on the second dwellings or on the properties purchased for the purpose of the expenditure, or up to three per cent.
As a result of the measure, the State Treasury accounts for EUR 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London real estate are purchased by citizens outside the United Kingdom, causing significant price increases, resulting in an ever more difficult situation for the first apartment buyers.
Many of the country’s rich districts have become “a city of spirit,” especially in the capital, as many foreign buyers spend much of their time outside the country.
The new bill came only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for the reduction of the fees to help young people who were waiting for their first home.
According to him, large construction companies are responsible for the high maintenance of real estate prices, which have become a habit of buying and leaving areas on parlagon. He has asked May to delete quotas for affordable houses and to start something with a "storage market shame" in the country.
Mr Corbyn has announced remarkable proposals on the series of housing reforms, including the elimination of rent controls and undue cancellations.
It would also provide more powers and opportunities for councils to build new houses.
May said: “I have told you that I want to devote my Prime Minister to the restoration of my English dream and that life is getting better for each generation.
This has to be the case for the real estate market.
Britain continues, as always, to be open to those who want to live, work and start a family.
However, it is not right for individuals living outside the country and companies with foreign interest to buy real estate just as easily as those who work hard in England.
Dreams from their own home have become almost inaccessible for too many people, and the unfair state of homelessness has become too available."
Jack Ross: “I want to be the manager of the Scottish team.”
Jack Ross, according to the Sunderland coach's statement, "the greatest desire" is to be one of the head of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would like to take up the challenge of raising the North-East club, which is currently the third place of the first-class league, with only three points behind the first-place.
He then transferred his headquarters to the stadium called Stadium of Light after he successfully returned St. Mirren's team to the first-class Scottish football championship in the previous season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a Jew.
Unfortunately, I was only able to access the reserve – said Ross in his Scottish BBC Sportsound programme.
– When I was a kid, I watched a lot of Scottish team games in Hampden with my father, and something has always come back to them.
But now I only have a chance to succeed as a club manager."
There's Dick Advocate, David Moyas, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio on the front post of the Sunderland manager.
The former coach of Allo Athletic doesn't care because he has to go to prints of such great names, and he has previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's offer.
"The success is now measured by whether I can get the team back to first class.
If we take the structure and facilities of the club, it will undoubtedly be in the first class league," he said.
"It won't be easy to get back, but it's more than likely I'm going to see my action here as success if I can get back to the club."
Ross' career as manager only started three years ago after he was a deputy coach at the Dumbarton team and spent 15 months in Hearts' gym.
Then Aolla helped her get back on her feet after the team fell back into third grade, and St. Mirren and St. Mirren on the edge of the fall got the title of the champion in the next season.
Ross claims he's feeling much more confident now than he's ever been in a player's career, either Clyde or Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academic.
“It was just a critical moment, ” she quoted the time spent as coach of Alloa.
– I clearly thought that managing is more for me than being a player.
That sounds weird, because I've done it well, I've had a very good life of it, and I've had some really memorable moments.
However, the lives of players are sometimes very hard.
There's a lot to go through every week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the work with stress and pressure, but management tasks lie with me.
I've always been interested in managing, and now that I've tasted it, I've been feeling the best in my skin since I was an adult."

According to a study, beer is the best thing to do on Saturday afternoon at 5:30.
In the summer heat wave there has been a significant increase in the turnover of UK pubs in difficulty, but there is still a great deal of pressure on restaurant chains.
Based on the data collected, the revenue of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business advisor to the statistics, said: “The trend of the previous month continued in July due to the long-lasting period and the longer-awaited presence of England, when the pubs experienced an increase of 2.8%, with the difference that there could be a higher decline than restaurants.
The fall in revenue of 1.8% in June has deteriorated further in July.
Pubos and bars selling mainly alcohol have been best met, who have grown even more than those in restaurants.
The pubs that offer food were also unpleasantly affected by the long-term sun, although not nearly as dramatic as the operators of restaurants.
It seems people prefer drinking at this time.
The income of pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% this month and the income from food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, according to a leisure and catering RSM analysis, “These results have followed the trend that has occurred since the end of April.
The weather and major social and sporting events are still the main source of revenue for the entertainment and catering industry.
It is not surprising that the food chains are in a difficult situation, and the reduction in annual revenue of 4.8% can be particularly painful due to the constant pressure on costs.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the operators, and it will only come to lighten up the more moderate weather in August."
The total increase in revenues from pubs and restaurants was 2.7% in July, with the exception of newly opened sites, which also reflects the slow pace of the introduction of new brands.

Five out of five children have social media accounts to hide from their parents
According to a survey, five out of five children (even when they are 11 years old) have social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
According to a survey conducted at 20 000 secondary schools, the number of “Insta websites” is increasing.
The news leads to increased fear of sharing sexual content
20% of students replied that they had a "main" account that their parents could see
Five out of five create a child (even when he is 11 years old) of social media that you hide from adults.
According to a survey conducted at 20 000 secondary schools, the number of ‘Insta figures’ is rapidly increasing, with which Instagram is referred to as a photo-sharing site.
The news shows a growing fear of sharing sexual content.
20% of the students replied that they have an unpatriated "head" account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found her a teenage profile on which she said "to rape".
According to research by Headmasters’ and Headistresss’ Conference (HMC) from Digital Awareness UK and independent school directors, 40% of the 11-18-year-olds have two profiles and 50% have recognised that they have private branches.
“I find it worrying that so many teenagers feel that they need to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot reach them,” said HMC leader Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletic Association.
Eilidh Doyle was selected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Association of Athletics at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle Scotland's most successful attitude and the president of the board, Ian Beattie, is of the opinion that sports decision-makers will be an inestimable support for his extensive international experience over the last decade.
“Eilidh is a great honor in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the international Athletics community, and his presence will help the development of Scottish Athletics,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I have been happy to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really help the work of Scottish sports leaders.”
Two of the four Olympic gold medals, which regularly declared an expert at BBC, received 200 metres and 400 metres on the Atlantic Olympics in 1996, were forced into a wheelchair because of a temporary brain-circulation.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I received a stroke.
I couldn't walk.

My mother's breast cancer like cows shares the online community
He put an online debate on the advertising of a company that makes breast-feeding babies, comparing breast-feeding mothers to head-to-head cows.
According to Elvie, he developed “the world’s first silent, bearable chest ” and published their product in an ironic advertisement that presented the freedom of the mothers who gave their milk.
Four real mothers dance in a cow stand full of apples, while in the background the songs that draw up the following lines can be heard: “Yes, I am thinking of myself, I don’t even have a dick” and “If I hadn’t noticed, they’re not a stock, but my breasts.”
And the refrén sounds like, "I'm pumping, pumping, eating big kids, pumping, pumping, cutting girls."
The advertisement published on the Facebook site of the company soon became a cross-section of online disputes.
The video has reached 77 000 views and has received several hundred mixed welcome comments. Many people say that the advertisement is gross from the dairy industry’s “borrowings.”
“A lot of tasteless cows promote the product.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only if they give life, but their wines are taken from them within days,” recalls one comment.
Elvie can be placed in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother )
Another comment says: “Yes, it is terrible also for the mother animal and for the calf.
But why don't we take advantage of them to sell breast-feeding to mothers who can keep their children?"
Someone else said, "Advertise fully insensitive."
Others came to the defense of advertising, a woman admitted that she thought the video was "a very funny one."
“I think it's brilliant.
I would've taken it directly if I'd been breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a crazy commercial, so I'm not gonna try to see it again.
The product is brilliant", wrote.
According to another comment: “This is a funny advertisement for mothers who head their milk at work or in a toilet, who feel like a cow.
He doesn't praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that during their dancing, their bra was in the discrete chest.
The campaign is based on the feeling that women using the chest can sometimes feel cows.
Elvie Pump, however, does not apply wires and pipes, can be placed discreetly in a breastfeeding bra, so women can move freely, hold their children in hand, or even move out during breast-feeding.
Ana Balarin, co-owner of Mother and the communication director, said: “Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product and therefore had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
We wanted to draw attention to the challenges faced by the use of breast-feedings and, in a funny way, to show what kind of sense of freedom our nipples give us."
Elvie's nipples didn't come into the news for the first time.
At London Fashion Week, Marta Jakubowski was dressed as a two-year-old mother while using the product.
Hundreds of migrants of childhood were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of child-age migrants in custody has reached a record, while the number of monthly border crossings has not changed much. This is partly explained by the fact that it is more difficult to find homes that are receiving them because of the brutal history of Trump administration and its measures so far.
In particular, receptionists themselves are illegal immigrants and fear that they will be affected by the possibility of staying in the country if they report to the child’s reception.
This threat was further increased in June when they announced that parents and adults living with them had to print and share these data with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, Chief Officer of Immigration and Customs Environment (Bemmigrant and Customs Office), admitted in his statement made last week before Congress that several dozen were arrested for the reception of minors who had arrived without the escort.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of the arresters were unpunished.
“80% of those applying for reception and living with them are illegally staying in the country and a large proportion of convicted criminals.
Therefore, we continue to search for such individuals," Albence said.
In order to speed up the procedure for children, new rules have been introduced, according to which a part of them must appear before the court within one month of their arrest instead of 60 days before the date on which they were taken.
A lot of people report through videoconference in court instead of personal appearances to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge doesn't give you legal protection, the immigrant will be deported quickly.
Over the past few months, social workers and those working in the system have reported how much longer they will be in custody, the more nervous and depressed the children will be, and the possibility of violent outbreaks or escape attempts will increase.
According to lawkeepers, these risks are only increased by a larger facility such as the towers, where the number of children makes it difficult to cover those who need psychological care.
They added that if they don't give the kids enough time to prepare or say goodbye to friends before they move them to such an establishment, they'll make them even more trauma.
Syria called upon the American, French, and Turkish “departure forces” to leave immediately.
Despite the 8th civil war in the country, the Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem, speaking before the UN General Assembly, asked the Syrian refugees to return to their country.
Moualem, who is also in charge of the Prime Minister's position, claimed that foreign armed forces have illegally entered Syrian territory on the basis of the fight against terrorism, and that they will "be treated like this."
"They must withdraw without condition," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem proved that “the war against terrorism will end soon” in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He stated that Damascus “ continued his sacred battle to clean up Syria’s entire territory” from terrorist groups and“the illegal foreign presence.”
The U.S. 2000 soldiers are in Syria, as training and advisors to help the Kurd forces and Arab militias fighting Bassar el-Assad.
France sent over 1,000 soldiers to the country affected by the war.
With regard to refugees, Moualem claimed that the conditions for their return are adequate and that only a “one Western country” is being swept away by the “irracial fears” of the refugees from their return.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help the population return home," he said.
"They made politics out of a purely humanitarian question."
The United States and the European Union have warned against providing reconstruction aid to Syria until political agreement was reached between Aszad and his opposition on the closure of the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recently established agreement between Russia and Turkey, which will create a battle zone for the last great mayor of those in need, around Idlib, can help further negotiations.
The Russian-Treak settlement prevented the Syrian government forces supported by the Russians from attacking the three million inhabitants.
Mr Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had set "light deadlines" and indicated his hope that military actions would be directed against only jihadists, including An-Nuss Front linked to Al-Qaida, which should be "researched".
Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee of delegations from the government and the opposition will soon be convened, whose task is to prepare the post-war Syrian constitution and prepare elections.
The participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, for example, is considered acceptable under the conditions of Moualem, for example only to ‘review some of the articles of the current Constitution’ and to protect all external actors from interference.
That's why Trumpot will be re-elected.
Following this logic, Trumpot will certainly be re-elected in 2020 unless there are a number of liberal viewers' hopes that it will not end up with a discharge procedure or a scandal before the Presidency.
We can be sure that this would be "the most dramatic presidential finale of all time."
For now, however, viewers enjoy the show.
Since 2014, CNN's main programme focus has grown to about 1.05 million and MSNBC has tripled its views, to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen's data, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers at the main event time instead of 1.7 million years ago, and the Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC is the most visited cable show with its 3.5 million audiences, which reach the nights of major news.
“It attracts us as the fire, because something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the leading producer of the drama series of the ABC’s “A designated survivor”. In this series, the office’s miniature sits in the president’s chair, after an attack by the Captain.
Nell Scovell Veterán, author of the Funny Parts: And the Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, is a different one.
Thus, a taxi trip to Boston prior to the 2016 election would arise:
The driver told me he was gonna vote for Trump.
“Why” – asked Scovel.
"Because he made me laugh," the driver replied.
It's the fun of chaos.
Of course, unlike television series, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases similar to Roe v Wade-precedens, whether they can reunite the immigrant families and the stability of the world economy.
Only a very narrow layer can make sure you don't mind these facts.
However, it is no longer part of the responsible information, when we are staring at a discussion show in which the authenticity of anonymous background talks used in Bob Woodward’s book entitled “French” or about Paul Manafor’s 15 thousand-dollar Struccker’s jacket (‘the body’s Arrogance’s clothing according to the wording of The Washington Post) or the consequences of his description of Stormy Daniels Trump, hhm, anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, that's all I've got about Super Mario from now on.
“A little feeling for people to watch a reality show where we get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, author of the “Sale Stars”. The Trump show is constantly changing, and new turns are coming every day (for example, N.F.L., starts to praise Kim Dzsongunt).
If you miss one part, you'll be left immediately.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a nice, 26-degree, sunny time in Kaain, yet he was in his house looking at MSNBC, while recording CNN's show.
He couldn't get rid of the TV as he began hearing Brett Kavanaugh at the Senate Justice Committee, where he was the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we produced those crazy shows, many said that was the beginning of the end for Western civilization, ” Fleiss pointed out.
I thought they were just kidding, but it seems they were right."

Both parties spend money in the worst competitions for the mid-term Congress election
No one was surprised that, in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, both parties spent money in countless ways after the re-circulation of the Congress districts, two active representatives fought for the same chair.
One of the competitions for the recently re-created district of Pittsburg, Democrat Conor Lamb, who received a mandate in an interim election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, the Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently a member of the former 12th Amendment of Pennsylvania, which shows a significant overlap with the 17th district today.
The map had to be redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January determined that the earlier district borders had been manipulated to the advantage of the Republicans.
In the fight for the 17th district, the funding bodies of the two parties, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republicn Campaign Committee (NRTC) were almost linked to each other during the campaign.
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after winning the March interim election in the 18th Congress district of Pennsylvania in close competition.
For more than a decade, the seat of his representative was the Republicans, with 20 exact advantages for Donald Trump.
According to political experts, democracies have a better chance of winning.
The United States considered sanctions against El Salvador due to China's support and then withdrew from the plan
Diplomatically, the Dominican Republic and Panama were already on Beijing's side, which Washington barely reacted to.
Donald Trump discussed with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pulled him out of the board of the Trump Organization.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the U.S. officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for their “serious decision that they did not support Taiwan” earlier announced Heather Nauert, the Minister’s spokesperson.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received about 140 million US aid in 2017, including the fight against drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial subsidies and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painfully affected by the Central American country, where unemployment and murder rates are also extremely high.
As the closed meetings continued, the North and Central American competent authorities postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been the continuation of a similar meeting last year, with the primary objective being to reduce migration to the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of administration made it clear that I would like to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
At the conference scheduled for mid-October, Vice-President Mike Pence also spoke, which, according to the diplomats, is a clear indication of the importance of administration.
The three Americans sent them quietly back to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue any convicted statements and did not take any criminal action.
John Bolton's white household spokesperson did not wish to comment on the details of the debate, which were reported anonymously by three American officials, including two diplomats.
They were supported by external analysts close to administration, who were also willing to speak anonymously.
Historical Experience
The next strike may be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who examines whether Trump's in any way hindered justice... ..but it has been made public by a number of facts.
Mueller's investigation is also supposed to cover whether Trump's team has cooperated with Russia trying to influence the elections.
If the Democrats are put in the majority in Congress, they must try to take responsibility for Trumpot, who may have to face the judgment of fellow politicians after the voters.
We can see that there is a lot of uncertain questions, and the fall of Trump is far from inevitable... as is its European friends.
Serious decisions must be taken on both sides of the Atlantic, depending on how far the fight will be.
In 1938 many German officers were ready to kiss Hitler, just waiting for the West to stand next to the Czech Republic in Munich.
The aid has not been granted, so it has not been possible to prevent the bloodshed of the following years.
It is at similar historical turning points that the inevitable development of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
In today's America, we can identify more of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump replaces the Deputy State Attorney General Rod Rosenstein who oversees Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's chair has been drinking since last year, when, as our newspaper has reported, it recommended to record discussions with the president and to pretend that Trump's inability to fill up his office.
Rosenstein says the Times reported the events in an inaccuracy.
“How will we respond if the F.B.I. study, initiated against Brett Kavanaugh, will be biased or incomplete, and, despite a serious sexual harassment charge, will be appointed as a member of the Supreme Court?
And the most important question is that in the interim elections we vote for a Congress that is ready to take responsibility for Trumpot?
If we fail these trials, democracy will be facing a long winter.
I trust it won't happen, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother, Czech Republic, was a Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once was situated in my ambassador's home.
My mother survived the holocaust, emigrated to America, and asked me to light candles on the table that wore the sign of the Svastics at the time of Sabbath.
Such cultural heritage, how can I be pessimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans, playing at Rangers, is a truster before the Rapid Vienna game
The Rangers will be receiving Rapid Wien on Thursday, and the Austrian victory against the Spanish Villarreal can provide them with participation in the Group of the League of Europe G.
Because of the knee damage in the middle-field Graham Dorrans, he was unable to take action in season 2-2 against Villarreal, but he feels that building this result, the Rangers could also set themselves more dazzling goals.
“ A great team, against Villarreal, was a good point,” said the 31-year-old player.
– We believed that we could score points, and we brought a point.
Maybe we could've pulled another goal in the end, but we can't complain about the tie.
They were better in the first half, and we turned on him in the second half.
Thursday will be another important European game.
I hope we can get the three points, but it won't be easy because they were good enough for their previous match, but we'll definitely have the strength to win behind our backs.
Last year was difficult, I was hurt, around the club, but now the atmosphere is very optimistic.
Our team is good, the guys enjoy the game, the training is good.
I hope that if we put everything in place, we can leave the last season behind us and achieve good results."
A lot of women worry about not paying enough for their age.
The surveyers had accurate ideas about what old-age care they wanted, but only a small part of them talked about it with family members.
According to the Nationwide survey, only half of the respondents discussed the expected costs of their old-age care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them answered about talking to their children about this.
“Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t usually raise the subject,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide’s life insurance business.
The following should be done.
First, discuss the question with your mate and children: You cannot expect them to provide you properly if you do not tell them in time what your needs are.
Together with its advisor and family, choose where and what care is needed; these decisions will have a significant impact on the future costs.
Enter a financial advisor: He can give useful ideas on how to pay for the planned care.
Financing may be made with a traditional insurance bond designed for old-age care or a hybrid savings insurance that can cover expenses or use as collateral your own assets... if you have enough resources to add to it.
Prepare the legal documentation: This way they will cut the possibility of a subsequent trial.
Trust a representative, a reliable person who is on your behalf on health issues, supervises his medical care and ensures that everything is expected to happen even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone's financial management.
This reliable person will make the necessary financial decisions and ensure that the accounts are paid when you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the details: Let’s assume that your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about your medicine and your allergy?
Such data shall be recorded in writing to be available at any time.
“It is not just financial issues that need to be clarified, nor does it matter who your doctor is,” Martin added.

Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Everything needs to be planned in advance."

Earthquake and fugitive in Indonesia
At least 384 lost their lives on Friday, when a high-power earthquake and then a fountain hit the city of Palu in Indonesia. According to the authorities, the number of victims could continue to increase.
The communication network of the region was also damaged, so for now there was no news of the Governor of Donggala, north of Palu, where he was a center of the 7,5 - strength earthquake.
More than 16 000 inhabitants had to be evacuated in Palu.
Some important information on Palu and Donggala is available on the island of Celebes:
The capital city of Palu Central Celebes, on the west coast of Celebes Island, was built at the end of a narrow bay, with 379 800 inhabitants estimated in 2017.
The 40th anniversary of the city’s foundation was celebrated by the earthquake and the fountain.
Governor Dongula has a length of more than 300 km on the north coast of Celebes Island.
The government population of the administrative region, which is less than the province, was around 299 200 in 2017.
Central Celebesz is characterised primarily by fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
The nickel mine is one of the important sectors of the economy, but mainly in Morowali, on the far side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Palut and Donggalat have been hit several times in the last 100 years.
A 1938 escape price killed over 200 inhabitants and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a fountain hit West Donggala, then nine died.

Federal prosecutors have requested death penalty for suspecting a terrorist attack in New York City.
New York federal prosecutors are asking for a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspect of eight terrorist attacks in New York City, and since 1953 there has been no execution in the state.
According to the 30-year-old Saipov, a truck hired from Home Depot in October was driven by several pedestrians and cyclists on the street of Also-Manhattan West Side Highway.
In order to prove the legality of the death penalty, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed his eight victims “wittedly” and that he was ‘ committed’ to injury, being in the office of the DA in the South of New York City district.
According to the file submitted, proof of any of the two charges may justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was accused of 22 crimes, including eight-line blackmail murders, which were used almost exclusively for organised crime, as well as for the destruction and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack called for significant planning and premeditated intent, the prosecutors claim, and Saipov, as they say, carried out his actions in a “mortal, cruel, inhuman” way.
‘Sayfullo Habibullaovic Saipov has caused the pain and loss of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
In the southern district of New York, the last decade of his death was a death penalty for a defendant.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In the New York Federal case, a fatal judgment was taken in 1953, including Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: two years earlier married couples were convicted of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, has been reported to have shown no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
During the interrogations, he claimed he was happy to do it.
Saipov said that ISIS videos on his phone gave him the idea of an attack, standing in the case file.
The police said they asked me to put out an ISIS driver in his hospital room.
All 22 charges made you innocent.
David Patton, one of the state defenders representing Saipovot, said that they were “seriously disappointed” because of the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the actual loss of life in prison for recognition would have been more favourable, and that the death penalty only prolongs the suffering of all those involved in the case," Patton claims.
Saipov has previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for a death penalty for their protection.
According to a member of Tory, NIGEL FAAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Mr Farage stated in the protest at the Tory Conference that "he calls the army of the people into battle".
According to the former Ukip leader, politicians need to feel the pressure of Eurosceptics after one of Theresa May's partners has suggested that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to Farage.
Peter Bone, who did not sign up for any office, said to the members of the Birmingham meeting, that the United Kingdom would have "belonged out long ago" if Farage were the Minister of Brexit.
It's a good sign of pressure within Mayre's heavy party, that Toryk on another protest against Brexit in the city.
May is trying to implement the elements contained in Chequers, which requires permanent recruitment between the Brexit and the residual parties and the EU.
According to his allies, he tries to reach agreement with Brussels in spite of the negative reactions, so that Eurosceptics and Workers can choose only from his package or from his "full chaos".
Bone, in the demonstration of Leave Means Leave in Solihull, which means we're leaving, said that we need to count off the Chequers Alku.
He suggested that Farage be included in the House of Lords and that the negotiations with Brussels should be entrusted.
"If he were to lead the negotiations, we would have left," he said.
He added: "I will stick with Brexit, but the Chequers alku should be counted with the Chequers."
When criticizing the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be servants of others.
We want to make our own country's laws."
Bone rejected the assumption that the public voice had changed since the vote in 2016: “There is no real basis for the British people to change their opinion and to stay.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a representative of the Brexit Party, also attended the meeting, said to the journalists: “I ask only that: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
The Chequers Alkut rejects the public opinion, the opposition will not vote, the party membership is unpopular, and especially the activists who work in the field and helped us get to the government.
Forget Chequers, and listen to us."
He added as a sarcasm addressed to May: “Only the Prime Minister can hold his seat and keep his word.”
Farage said at the meeting that politicians should "be able to feel pressure" so as not to tell the results of the 2016 referendum.
“The confidence between us, that is, between the people and our politicians, has now been expressed at stake.
- They want to sell Brexite, and today we're gathered together to say, we're not going to let them do it."
These were the words: “I would like our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brex, to feel pressure.
We call the army of the people into battle to win the Brexite, and let us not rest until we re-establish the United Kingdom as an independent, proud, proud country."
The remaining parties also attended Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting at the center of the city.
Some activists took up the flag of the "Toryk Against Brex" movement this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party, for the purposes of applying the party, was established on the conservatives due to the security errors that occurred during the opening of the conference.
"These people said that they have the IT background for an agreement on Canada-plus plus, a border crossing and a free trade agreement with Ireland without borders.
- They're just talking to you.
He was simply not good at Brex" – he stressed.

Russian grand prize: Lewis Hamilton closer to the world champion's address after he won before Sebastian Vettel thanks to the team travels
Having qualified himself to a better place than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, the Mercedes team's orders will play a big part in my run.
Buttas, starting from no position, started well, and almost put Hamilton into trouble, because the first two round he was protecting his position, which enabled Vettel to attack his teammate.
First he stood up in the bushes with Vet, and he let Hamilton get stuck in the back of the middle field, which should have proved decisive.
Mercedes stood a round later, and he came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came after a nearby mission, during which the Ferrari's pilot, he left the inner curve free after he moved twice as a defense in the third bend.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started out from the back row of the box, and at the end of the first round, was the seventh.
After that, he led most of the race, since he didn't trade rubbers, so he could quickly target and stop Kimi Räikkönen in the hope of the fourth place.
Finally, the 44th round stood in the bokzutca, but the remaining eight round could not increase his pace, so Räikköne became the fourth place.
“The next day was because Valtter was doing fantastic work all weekend, and he was a real gentleman when he was instructed to let go.
The team did an exceptional job to get the first two seats," said Hamilton.
His body language was really bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday because the senator insisted that he did not leak the letter of Christine Blasay Ford, which accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment as a new member of the Supreme Court.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to Ford's testimony, which he made before the Senate Committee on Justice, only noted, the things in the Senate prove that people are “truths, hateful and liars”.
“What may happen, and the wonderful thing that happened in the last few days in the Senate, when they see anger, when they see that people are angry, disbelief, hateful and lying,” he said.
“If we look at statements and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
That wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
I did not leak."
Well, let's stop for a second.
We leaked it?...No, we didn't leak it," he added, after the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh to Feinstein in July and leaked out the letter early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have been the source of his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims and leaked his story," Feinstein said to the committee, according to The Hill's report.
"He asked me to handle it confidentially, and I treated it confidentially in accordance with his request."
However, it seems that the President did not accept his refusal at the meeting on Saturday evening: “I will tell you what was going on: his body language was very bad.
Maybe he didn't leak it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president, by claiming the protection of a member of the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women, continued to use the alleged accusations for their own purposes.
“ We were determined to have any means, but they regained power.
They can see disbelief, hatelessness, no matter who they're hurting, they have to run through to gain power and control," said the President, Mediaite.

According to the latest announcement by an airline operating a flight in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, a man disappeared, although earlier it was claimed that both 47 passengers and crew evacuations were successful from the sinking plane.
According to Air Niugini's press release, on Sunday afternoon, a man cannot account for a passenger.
According to the airline, he's working with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately reply to any further information on the passenger, such as questions on age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and staff after flying into the water while landing at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported transporting seven people to the hospital.
According to the airline, six passengers left at the hospital on Saturday, all of us in stable condition.
The cause of the misfortune and the exact course of events have not yet been clarified.
According to the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon outside the runway.
According to some witnesses, the plane's been blocking the runway.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said that the plane was very low.
"This is an enormously good thing" – said Jayes.
Jaynes told me that he and others were able to gas the power in the water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the air escorts were panicking and yelling, and he suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, nearby shipowners to repair a cargo lot helped rescue, and they took people to the shore with a blowable boat before the plane sinked 30 metres under the water.

It's a great story to put together the events of the night when a woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the D.A. presented the accusation to the man at his retrial, accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett has been witnessing his information analysis experts for hours.
He knew with the jury how he put together the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements on the night she died.
According to Rowlett, he received location data from several phones, according to which he was with Tellis Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicts the earlier claims made by the man, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when the man said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford was testifying on Saturday when he told me that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "was sick because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said she knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
According to cell phone data, they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett reported that, after Chambers died, Tellis deleted her text messages, phone calls and contacts from her phone.
"He erased her from her life," said Hale.
Protection is planned to start closing on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be brought before the jury that day.

Another black one?
The New York dada sued after a "grassist" message due to the release of a couple.
A young lady in New York suing a couple for a discrimination against a couple, after a wrong message sent to her, the mother complained that they were able to apply a “black one again. ”
The couple deny that they're racist, and the trial is like "scraping."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, disappointed her when she saw her black in 2016 when she arrived at Giselle Maurice on her first working day.
“SEYELY, YOU’RE A WELCOME!" – wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after she woke up, the Plasco-Flaxman who was "unspeakable" released Ms. Maurice, claiming that the outgoing nanny, who was African-American, did a bad job, and that she was more of a philosopher.
Ms. Maurice was paid one day's work and then sent home with a Uber.
Maurice is suing the party for credit due to the discharge, asking for a daily compensation of 350 dollars for the work for the six-month period that was originally hired, even though it was not a contract.
"I want to show them to stop the journey," he said to the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple responded to the accusations of racism that the termination of Maurice was reasonable because they were afraid they could not trust him after they were offended.
"My wife sent him something she didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We are not racist," said the husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
“ But would you trust your children to someone with whom, if by chance, he was rude?
His newborn?
Come on!"
According to Plasco, similar to the trial, his wife only delivered the baby two months ago, and he was in a very difficult situation.
‘ Would anyone ever attack such a thing?
It's not really a nice thing to do," added the investment banker.
While legal proceedings are taking place, the court of public opinion has already condemned the party in the social media, indemnifying their behaviour and logic.
According to a letter just found, the publisher of the Paddington was afraid that readers would not be able to connect to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “There is someone who can imagine us being replaced by someone who will first read it before it was published.
It's kind of fun this information right now, when we know what a huge success the Paddington is."
According to his statement, his father, who worked as the cameraman of the BBC, before he was inspired to write a child book about a little game bear, would have no problem if his work had been rejected, and then added that the 60th anniversary of the book was a bitter after his father's death last year.
Paddington called him "a very important member of his family" and added that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, he was not trained at all,” he said.
“But since Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a child who takes something: we are proud of him even if we really don’t deserve it.
I think he saw Paddington's success somehow.
Although he made it and he fell out of his imagination, he always attributed success to himself in Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye through the phone.
On landing, your daughter was put in Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where the doctors were in vain fighting for her life.
“They regularly called to tell me that he was in very bad condition and that he was not expected to survive,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I received a call from Nad, in which she told me that my daughter would die in the next two minutes, and I must thank her.
I said good-bye.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave him to keep on beating his heart were slowly gone and then left his body.
He died before, and then everything stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait to know that everything was over.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a place surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now grieving for her daughter's loss, got into the plane with the others who didn't care about the attempt she's been through.
"No one knew," he said.
“ I fell off my head, and my tears were ringing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on that plane, I felt this over-reacting sympathy for them.
That you need my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much."
Image to prevent suicide on the bridge with grieving women
Two women who lost their loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent them from throwing away their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put out postcards with inspirational messages and emergency numbers on a walkie's bridge.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he was depressed and then committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the same thing I feel every day,” he said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, told me that his son was a promising cook, and he got stuck on everyone.
“He knew everyone about his smile.
They always said that his smiles are gonna throw up any place."
However, before he died, he gave up his work because he was “very bad”.
Tyler, who ended his life with his own hands, was then found by his 11-year-old brother.
Ms Davis said: “I was constantly concerned that this would result in some kind of domino effect.”
Ms. David prepared postcards for “the purpose of knowing that people are able to look and talk to them, even if it is just a friend.
Don't be quiet – you have to talk!"
Ms. Humphreys, who has been Ms. Davies' girlfriend for years, lost Mark, who had been a partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was depressed, depressed or anything," he said.
“Some days before Christmas we noticed a change in your attitude.
He was completely on his own Christmas day: when the children had their gifts cut out, he didn't look in their eyes, and they were like this."
He said that his death had a huge trauma for them, but they must prepare: “He left great space in the family.
He broke our hearts to little pieces.
But we must continue to fight."

Questioner Brett Kavanaugh's future as the FBI starts his investigation
"I thought if we could achieve what he asked, a limited-time investigation, perhaps we could reach agreement", said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that the committee held the party 'out of the fall' because of its indecision.
Why were Mr Kavanaugh and Republican supporters opposed the FBI investigation?
Their resistance can only be attributed to timing.
The interim election is only five weeks away on 6 November, and if the Republicans are not expected to do well, it will be much harder for them to get their people to the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and he also met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases his report?
There is a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will receive the minimum of 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow the Vice-President Mike Pence to decide to put Mr Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of dissidents "decreased" under Kim's control
The number of North Korean dissidents to South Korea has decreased since Kim Dzsongun took power seven years ago, declared a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Bjangok quoted the South Merger Ministry data and said that last year 1127 dissidents against 2011, when that number was 2706.
Park said that the tighter border guard between North Korea and China and the higher punishments for human smugglers were the main causes.
Phenjan did not comment on this information publicly.
Most of the North dissidents finally get South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans entered the border illegally since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most of them travel towards China, which is at the longest border in North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized area (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
The dissidents are known as illegal immigrants in China, not as refugees, and often send them back by force.
The practically still-war relationship between North and South has improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenjan, at the heart of their discussions on the ongoing nuclear arrest negotiations.
This meeting took place in June between President Donald Trump and President Kim Dzsongun in Singapore, where further cooperation on nuclear-free Korean Peninsula was agreed in large lines.
However, on Saturday, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Jongho accused the American sanctions for the lack of progress since.
"In the absence of trust in the Americans, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is inevitable that we unilaterally lower our weapons," said Ri in his speech at the United Nations High Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "historic", saying that he was incapable of the Supreme Court
The minority president of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh “historical” as the Supreme Court, and claimed that his conduct did not correspond to the work of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi performed an interview like this at the Texas Tribune Festival in Texas Austin.
“I had no intention of thinking that if a woman acted like this, I would call her “historic” – she explained Pelosi’s reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Thursday Senate Justice Committee.
In the heat of Kavanaugh's emotions, he protested against the rumors that he would have sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasay Ford in their teens.
In his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes he yelled and his voice was closed when he talked about his family and his high school years.
In addition, he specifically condemned the Committee's Democrats, calling it "grotesk and coordinated character murder", the defeat of Hillary Clinton in 2016 was organised by angry liberals.
Pelosi told me that Kavanaugh's conduct proved that he was not capable of working at the Supreme Court because he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I believe he has excluded himself from his statements and conduct against the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi was hacked when they asked if he would try to take responsibility for Kavanaugh, in case the post was filled, and if the Democrats were to get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"As far as I'm concerned, if you don't tell Congress or the FBI, it's not just for the Supreme Court, but not for the court where you are right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently in a judicial position at the Supreme Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that he was concerned as a Democrat about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh on the matter of affordable supply or Roe v Wade, as Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings of Kavanaugh, the questions about whether or not they would copy the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“There is no time for a hysterical, biased person to be among the members of the court, and he expects us to tear us from joy,” Pelosi said.
And women have to keep their hands on it.
It's a legitimate rush, months, and years of rage that has grown up, and it can't get out of you without crying.
“When we're angry, ” said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think this is so rare, do I?"
“A woman who worked in some leadership position was very helpful to me – she told me that she was crying in anger, but she worked out a technique that, when she started crying in anger, she said to her conversation partner: ‘You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I am angry.”
And then he kept going.
And I thought that was a great idea."
In part, they look at tears as a sign of anger because they're misunderstandings.
One of my most lively memories of an early job from an office ruled by men, where I once started crying in my angry impenetrable, that an older woman took me to my neck — a cool manager I've always feared — and took me to the stairwell.
"Let them cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're gonna be happy because they're able to upset you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with a non-marital affair in a hair called Monkey Business, he fell out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, thinking in his deep frustration that there was no reason why he could not start for the presidency himself.
“It wasn’t a well - thought - out decision, ” she said to me, laughed 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the contest, and the new candidate was wanted in the middle of their backs.
Someone named "The Snow Whites and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign had been held for a long time, Ms. Schroeder has missed the money collection, so he agreed not to compete unless he'd collect $2 million.
It was an act of defeat.
He realized that some of his supporters gave the men $1,000, but he only got $250.
"They thought I'd get a discount?" he thought.
When a press conference was held that he did not launch an official campaign, emotions were so overwhelmed by gratitude to the people who supported him, as well as the frustration against the system of money collection and achieving the voters directly, and the anger caused by sexism, that the throat was reduced.
"They thought I had nervous breakdowns," Ms. Schroeder pointed out how the press reacted to it.
"They believed that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my gravestone.
"He was crying?"
How can the US-China Trade War be good for Beijing?
The trade war between the United States and China was almost ploughing, and the battle has not yet ended, according to experts, breaking between countries could favour Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, launched the first warnings at the beginning of the year by taxing the most important Chinese export products, including solar elements, steel and aluminium.
The most significant idea was this week, since the new duties have already affected a product worth USD 200 billion, practically taxing half of the goods from China to the US.
In all cases, Beijing reduced its duty rate of between five and ten per cent and the last US product of USD 60 billion.
China has agreed that it will come back every time, and the second largest economy in the world will certainly not be back in the near future.
If you'd like to get Washington to back up, it would mean that you're going to have to put the dereka in front of the claims, but the public bowing to the United States beyond would be embarrassing for Hszi Chin-ping, the President of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing is to act well, the US's commercial war pressure can be good for China in the long term, as it reduces dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision can create conditions for any economy in the two countries, whether in Washington or Beijing, is much more serious than the previous recognition of the observers,” said Abigail Grace, research assistant researching Asia at the New American Security stroke.
Syria is "ready ready" to return to the refugees, claims Minister of State
Syria claims that it is ready to return to refugees and to seek assistance in rebuilding the country that has been destroyed for more than seven years in the war.
In his speech before the United Nations Assembly, Minister Valid Moallem claimed that the state's condition would improve.
"The current situation is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues the rehabilitation of areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now there are all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to escape between terrorism and economic measures that had to escape, which affected their daily lives and their lives.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Moallem said that the Syrian state would welcome all the help it could bring to the country's reconstruction.
However, he stressed that countries would not accept conditional assistance or involvement that supported recovery.
Europe has acquired Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018, overcoming the US team 16,5:1,5 p.m., held Le Gold National outside Paris.
The US has now fallen six times in the European scene, and since 1993 it has not won Ryder Cup in Europe.
Europe has protected its title as the Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn has reached the 14.5 point necessary to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star player who was struggling all the way to the tower, put him in the water at par-3, 16 holes, giving Francesco Molinari this victory.
The Italian golf player Molinari was glowing all over the place, so he became one of the four players who ever achieved 5-0 results since the tournament was in its current form in 1979.
The U.S. Jordan Spieth received 5&4 from the lowest ranking player in Europe, Dan Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2&1 against the English Ian Poulter, who may have participated in the last Ryder Cup.
In the eight Ryder-kup veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best winner of the tournament for all time in Europe with 25,5 career points.
“I don’t cry when I’m tired, but I couldn’t stop today.
It was a pretty tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he has chosen and believed in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy I got the cup back.
It's all about the team, and I'm happy to help you," said Garcia, who's struggling with feelings after her European victory.
Give it to Jon Rahm, who, on Sunday, defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods on person 2-11.
"I can't help feeling proud that I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this man," said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost all four games in France, and now he's got a 13-21-3 career record in Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistics from one of the biggest players ever who won 14 major titles, and only Jack Nicklaus's performance.
The U.S. team has been fighting all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who have been doing great golfing throughout the tournament.
After the shocking result of Jim Furyk's team captain in the United States, he declared that he “was proud of these guys because they fought.
There was a time this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Cut the hat in front of Thomas.
It's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will work together with our team, the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love this 12 guys, and I'm proud to be your captain.
You're gonna have to raise your hats, too.
The opponent was better than us."
