There was a nine-year-old boy in Tampere who ran away.
Police have had a search assignment due to a nine-year-old boy's escape trip in Tampere on Tuesday night.
The missing boy report from Western Tampere with his friend has spread in social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted and has no life and health risk.
The son's father told Ilt-Sanom half-night that he's been found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the ex-post verifications.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home, Dad told me.
Ronando, once again, rips off the paint line for Messin.
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals on the Spanish league weekend and continued his factory on the Master's league.
The fight between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo from the league of the Masters turned to the latter for at least one moment.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo was alone at the top of all-time paint statistics when he shot a visitor to the Shahtar Donetsk network with two hits on the penalty kicks and one on the game situation.
Ronaldo lifted his goal portfolio to 80, before Tuesday, the Barcelona Messiah has 77 hits on the track.
Real won the 4-0.
Juventus has been making fun of the Italian football league at Serie A since the beginning, but in the master's top D segment, it started with a 2-1 visitive victory in Manchester City.
The winning goal was made by plenty of ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack made the absence of Sergei Aguero of the knee-responsible.
Aguero, injured in a weekend's dial game, came to the field only on the last ten minutes.
Manchester’s Second Society United experienced hard work in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering from a 1-2 kill.
The 20-year-old shipkeeper Luke Shaw's guest game could only take a quarter hour.
The dangerous moving resistance of the PSV Hector Moreno hit the finish line towards the attacked ManU pack so badly that Shaw was likely to break his leg.
Shaw lay on Eindhoven's home stadium lawn for ten minutes before the medical staff went to drive him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests to the 1-0 line in 41 minutes, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno set up before the break.
In the second half of the time Luciano Narsingh was doing the PSV victory painting.
In the league of the Masters of the Landing season, Paris Saint-Germain started in block A.
The case had changed the PSG pain in Manchester United's shirt from Argentina to Angel Di Maria.
Di Maria broke through the right and pulled the ball through the back corner of Malmö's goalie Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made a 2-0 for the second half of the PSG.
PSG has been dragged into the successes of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league, is not the best possible benchmark.
The PSG star player Zlatan Ibrahimovic first met his professional career, Malmo FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career at Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team, Moscow's TsSKA, lost the game of block B in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately called for a distinction - the President gave the wrong speech.
President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has given the country the same speech again in Parliament, which he held at the end of last month.
In his 25 minutes speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts about the 91-year-old Mugabe in full power of life.
The main opposition party, MDC, called on Mugabe to resign because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants rushed to say that the confusion had only taken place in Mugabe’s department and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mr Mugabe's speech discussed earlier, and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an extra summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
The President of the European Council leading the summits, Donald Tusk, assesses the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
According to Merkel, negotiations on asylum seekers' quotas are at the table of the Home Affairs Ministers.
The teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during the emergency call.
Just sound a little bit like college teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during the emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police should come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "black dog" was alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact information of the loved ones of the dead woman was found on this phone.
Within the house, the police found the body and the enemy on the page of the handwritten message: "I am so sorry I could cancel this beloved Amy and she is the only woman who has ever loved me," said a letter from experts that says Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Cleveland Delta State University in Minnesota, had already traveled almost 500 kilometers to the school campus, where the police believe he had shot and killed a history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this office.
The police chief of Delta State University Lynn Buford told the university staff about the shooting at 10.18.
He said Lamb called the fateful emergency call for a while after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose again: Lamb committed suicide during the division of the police.
The authorities still tried to find out Lamb’s motive for the day after the students and staff had to hide behind locked doors due to a school drop.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information that says that students and staff described Lamb as a gifted teacher, which may have had problems.
The students told me that they were waiting for her hours.
In Prentiss's death scene, Gautier, the police say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in the book he wrote, where he thanked "the impossible people" with whom he shared the academic life.
Both taught at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended both courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
The student named Brandon Beavers said hello to Lamb, but said that he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something had been wrong."
Another student Mikel Sykes said Lamb told me that he had a lot of stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for sick leave, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university pay principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, he did not decline his automatic career development and the post of assistant professor.
The university principal William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt to know that there was something in his mind.
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After Lamb escaped from the campus, the police got to him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol at the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Missipp Greenville, told Methel Johnson, the Washington district's death seeker.
Lamb's car was still in the yard.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this very house, even though Johnson said he believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009 and taught geographical and educational sciences. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city of about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb conducted his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as smart, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston told me he was 15 years old and Lamb's 20 years old when they met together through friends.
Hairsto's friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried to teach Hairston for many years to play guitar.
He was quite a charm in those days.
All the girls were melted with wax when she was there, now told about the 40-year-old Hairston who lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
I guess Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for a while.
In an emergency speech, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the riverside brick house in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' former husband Shawn O'Steen told me that he was divorced 15 years ago, but he's still friends, and now he's got a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Ste described his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me that he had never met Lamb, but he had heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and called blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail both appeared on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they called together on some gigs.
O'Steen told me that his daughter does and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, the barman of The Julep Room, who is near Gautier, tells us that he saw Lamb and Prentiss last night in September 5 after Lamb had finished his guitar and lipstick performance to a few audiences.
Nothing seemed wrong.
"Only a happy couple," he said.
We were playing games and throwing whispers at each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
The dead teacher Schmidt conducted the first year’s student seminar program and was specializing in Indians and colonial history, told the school’s English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emphoria State University in Kansas and was the chairman of his fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday night in Cleveland, Delta State's campus was held a candle-scraping campaign involving about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in a masseuse during which the university choir sang songs to Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The lesson goes on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report to the Mississippi Cleveland.
The Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus from Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans took part in the report.
The case has been corrected by the fact that the police are now saying that Lamb called after Schmidt was shot, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that it does not employ as many workers as last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that the current regular and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, while 45 000 employed in the 2014 holiday period.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
The company said that the interviews of the applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months of holiday time, the season of Christmastime is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with the occupation of shops and the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking with Princess Diana.
The first night of the future film, Michael J. Fox was an extremely important moment of professional importance.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal arrival, and I realized that I was sitting next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," she said the coming documentary film back in Time's trailer.
The movie starts and I think I'm just gonna be on a tea break and a hand out of a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the future film of Foxy, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and director Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future was first night 30 years ago.
Spielberg told me, "It's definitely the finest time travel film of all time."
Back in Time is available as an order video, DVD and some cinemas in October.
United Nations leader says that Syria does not resolve the situation in a armed manner
The response of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict "not solved in a armed manner", and additional weapons only worsen violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN leader again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to join and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference in Wednesday, Ban told me that he was going to meet five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in connection with the General Assembly Council week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted the fact that the distribution of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional forces "has made it impossible to resolve the situation."
Ban called on five permanent Member States to show solidarity and consensus when dealing with the Syrian crisis, as demonstrated by the agreement on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 advocacy to show that Donald Trump is true
Some have tried to make him a windmill.
Others think he's just a joke.
Some of them are waiting for the collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to slow Donald Trump away from the top of the support polls, it has not (beautiful) succeeded.
Of the last 11 national surveys in ten Donald Trump has been in charge in the two-digit century, some have begun seriously to consider what this means in terms of the potential of the real estate.
Of course, the election is only in the early days.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to be a candidate for the Republican Republican.
Comments point out that at this stage in 2011 Rick Perry was losing control of Herman Cain, both of whom did not receive any state in the appointment process.
There are also many reasons why he has problems in general elections.
However, external groups such as the Jeb Bush Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth have taken note of Trump's sinfulness and started to use his funds to bring him down.
The following recent surveys of support indicate that the building king is not just a transient step:
Trump's popularity figures have made a full translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, the examination of the support at Monmouth University showed that only two of the ten Republicans welcomed the real estate King.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At present, six out of ten Republicans are in favour of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten says they have a negative attitude.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
Last week, 60% of Republicans said that they were in favour of Trump.
Two-thirds of the Republican voters would be pleased if Trump became a candidate.
In CNN/ORC's questionnaire last week 67% of the Republicans said that they would be either "industrated" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said that they'd be "satisfied" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson produces almost the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% of "incentived" vs. Trump's 40%).
Next, most inspiring?
Marco Rubio's only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "dissatisfied" if Jeb Bush became a candidate.
The nature of Trump's fire is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpic has been widely criticised for his excellent speeches and insults, on Monday according to the ABC News/Washington Post survey, 52% of the voters who are eminent at national level think that the King of Real Estate has an appropriate quality for the President.
According to last week’s survey, Iowa’s first party meeting in the state is the same: 52% of the Republicans think Trump has the right character for the director.
However, according to ABC/Post's questionnaire 44% think that his character is not suitable for the President, and almost six out of ten believe that his character is not part of the White House.
The Republicans are going to get used to the idea.
When Republicans think like commentators, they think Trump is a real alternative.
According to CNN/ORC's survey, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asked who is most likely to be appointed candidate for the Republicans.
At the end of July four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Release of information: Republican voters have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball available.
In the last parliamentary term, four out of ten Republicans felt that Rick Perry was appointed candidate, and only 28% supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any event, this shows that most of the voters in the Republican Party consider Trump's campaign credible.
Even if the Republicans were to support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the sickle field is likely to have contributed to Trump's leadership, as Trump's opposition is divided between numerous other candidates.
However, the survey carried out by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He runs Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points as well as Rand Paul, John Kasichi and Chris Christie with 33 points.
He's on a level with Ted Cruz.
The only winning candidate in Trump?
If they were put in a fight, Ben Carson would win a businessman with a big 18 points apart.
Just now, the majority of Donald Trump's supporters have told us that he has made a decision.
The new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that just over half of Trump’s advocates have decided to have their voice go.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say for sure that he will never change his mind.
46% said that they could possibly switch candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unwarranted winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say that Trump agrees with immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants "rapers" in his campaign statement, immigration has been at the centre of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s high point is to drive Latin voters further away from the Republican Party and to harm migrant businesses.
According to the new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of matters, so is Donald Trump.
Absence to the government has reached a new peak.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely because of their position outside of politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said on Monday in the ABC/Post survey that they choose a non-political person rather than one with a government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago, Des Moines Register/Blumberg's survey of Iowa showed that three of the four Republican Iowa are frustrated with the Republican Congress: 54% are "unsatisfied" and 21% are "true".
Jeremy Corbyn's first presentation at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Corbyn's first interview has been eagerly expected.
The new leader of the Labour Labour Party, Jeremy Corby, will meet David Cameron for the first time at Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby rises to ask about his first six questions a little after noon, and probably both the media and the Labour Party's representatives were very careful about his performance.
Corby's been calling for this weekly show of "lower theater and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities for his colleagues to attend.
This encounter is the first parliamentary trial for Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and he spoke at the annual meeting of the Associations' Central Organisation on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the leader of the Labour Party to keep silent during the national song was held in a memorial service organized by the Fighting from Britain on the 75th anniversary of the air war, raised criticism of the conservative party’s representatives and appeared in several front page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing has attracted attention
Corbyn's representative said to him "insolently silent" and he confessed to "the bravery of royal Air Forces in the Great Britain Air War."
Mr Owen Smith, member of the Corbyn shadow government, said to the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he would have invited the Labour Party leader to sing a national song despite his view that the King's room should be terminated.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in the Corbyn internal border, calling for differences in economic, defence and external affairs.
The BBC policy correspondent, Robin Brant, says that there are differences in policy regarding the role of the party in the European Union and the state of play of the government's aid ceiling have also been 'assembled' within the working party since Corbyn was appointed.
At the meeting of the Associations, Corbyn said that the Labour Party is proposing a change that would remove the entire roof.
A few hours later, Mr Smith said that the party was "very clear" about the fact that they were merely opposed to the government plans to cut the ceiling from 26 000 pounds to 23 000 pounds.
Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party, whom David Cameron has met during the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The director of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now tells us that he has "supervised" ideas for the Prime Minister, and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
Mr Corbyn of the Islington North has said that the nature of Question Times is too counterbalanced and that he intends to refrain from both clever wording and suffocating, allowing for serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corby has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow government's finance secretary, will be in his place at the polls when Corby does not participate, for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corby has also proposed that other colleagues might sometimes be able to make speeches, and he has said that he has approached the president of the sub-room, John Bercowi, from the point of view.
When Cameron came to lead in 2005, he said that he wanted to move away from a political theatre that is often linked to Prime Minister's Question Time, but later he had to admit that he had failed.
Since they began on television in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important gauge in assessing the leadership's discretion, the management of his sub-rooms, and his position with other people's representatives, even though critics have criticised the way in which they have become just a gloomy, which requires far-reaching reforms.
Image given in Journey: Education of homeless young people as photographers
It's a difficult place to stay homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is an unprofitable studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and gain it.
BBC News met one of the young graduates from the first project.

The weight rises as the UK wage rises
The value of the cloth jumped up after the numbers showed an increase in the salary of the United Kingdom, while the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller.
Between May and July, the UK's wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent from the same time last year.
The growth rate was fastest after 2009 and it was considered to bring estimates of the increase in the course.
It rose to over 1% against $1,505, and to 0.84% against EUR 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index was closed at an increase of 1.49 per cent to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most separate share in the market and rose by 20 % after the competitor AB InBev approached it with the offer.
The agreement would bring together two world’s largest brewery and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artos, Peron and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent after the encouraging news of the competing luxury group Richmont.
Richemon's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had started to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose by 5% after the miner told us that it had collected $2.5 billion by calculating the shares as part of its debt- cut-off strategy.
The package and paper group Mondi's shares were the largest in the index of 4,3 % after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from company to "sale".
JD Sports rose 3.1 per cent after the sports view company published a half-year before taxes: 83 per cent increase to 46.6 million pounds.
According to JD Sports Director, higher wages can harm enlargement
Peter Cowgill, Director of JD Sports, says that, if workers are to be increased in the UK, it may mean that "the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase".
However, this purchasing power is not likely to exceed the higher labour costs charged to the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs could be related to the company's enlargement plans, he added, which would mean less jobs.
Metcash begins the grass root campaign against the invasion of Ald
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA shop from Ald's attack in South and West Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grass root campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before the attack of Aldi $700 million.
Aldi prepares two distribution centres and first trade openings early next year to South and West Australia, where up to 120 trades are coming. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food dealers and build IGA brands through the marketing of current and social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA’s traders and buyers have jumped in, and brands like Dunsborough’s ice-cream maker Simmo's offer corn in IGA’s shops, and shop owners sell discount-priced tickets to Australian football games to their customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on 29 September when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and iron is holding an annual investor strategy day.
There is a great deal in the game, as South and West Australia account for nearly 30% of the area of Metcash IGA stores, with a higher yield margin than the IGA network of the Eastern Metcash states.
Those who shop in South and West Australia are known to be square, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% in the eastern countries.
The analysts, like Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will take about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first movements.
In this week's report, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers can lose $ 360 million annually in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 movements next year in the south and in the west of 30 movements, which will generate a turnover of USD 500 and $600 million in these regions.
Loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash's high fixed costs base can cost Metcash some $13 million for loss of business before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash lost market share in eastern states mainly for Ald and Coles, although the recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA’s customers were most credible.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 so that its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Investment Fund and the founder of Magella Financial Group, Hamish Douglas, said on business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "be the best possible loss in a decade".
Metcash has refused to reply publicly to Douglas's comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of Metcash's board would have contacted Douglas last week.
After 2010, IGA's market share has decreased from 18% to 14%, and revenues from Metcash's food and food business, which pass on products to around 1200 IGA resellers, has decreased by 43% since 2012.
However, the wholesaler has been keeping half of it and has invested over 150 million dollars a year in reducing weekly prices of hundreds of products to the same level as Coles and Goolworths, helping IGA dealers to repair shops by increasing more rapidly growing fresh food and bringing on the market a better choice of private brand products.
Ian Morrise, Director General of Metcash, says that the calculation of prices and the improvement of sales have increased attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of returns in 2017, for the first time in four years.
The Australian tennis union president Steve Healy supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanas Kokkinakis deserves more honor than criticism of his conduct
Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer as a side in a recent storm, which has been exhilarating around his friend Nick Kyrgyos. He deserves more credit than criticism of his own behavior, says Steve Healy, chairman of the Australian tennis union.
A talented two-legged member, called "Special Ks", Kokkinakis, was unwittingly exposed to a case in which Kyrgyos provoked Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters competition.
Soon thereafter, in an alien boxing match in Cincinnati, the main judge had twice to break up the Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison when Harrison declared: "Wawrinka should have beat Kyrgyos, and I should have beat that cock."
Even though Kokkinakis was last seen disintegrating his land after he ruined his potential victory at Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been a solid defender in Kokkinakis.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth from another place in doubles with Bernard Tomic at Davis Cup's semifinal against Britain.
"I'm pretty strongly in the opinion that Thanas has just been dragged into ruins," Healy said.
He broke his land when he was lost because of the cramp in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his land when he's frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved perfectly well, including in quite provocative situations in the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, a nice family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He is very mature to 19 years old, he works hard, fits with the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he is practicing firmly, is in good condition and is quite peaceful and mature young man, and I think he should be assessed according to his merit.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgyo in important games starting on Friday, describing this 'common decision' as a solution for all, but still supporting the Canberrai return to the team's spying.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games and not everything around [Cyrgyos]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen very quickly, as Federerer and Murray have pointed out, and he is growing up in public, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and for him if he spends some time away from the public thinking of these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declare emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared an exceptional situation and shut down its southern border against Serbia by arresting those who sought to enter the country illegally, with the aim of the escape of the migratory flows.
At the border, chaos followed when hundreds of migrants gathered in a neutral area, and the Serbian authorities reacted with sturdy reaction.
The people who fled the violence in their own countries have now set up their tents and settled on the road for an unspecified period between the inspection stations in two countries.
However, there was an increase in vanity.
As the police helicopter remained above them, immigrants said, "Open the border!" and called insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water for protest.
The Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs declared that it is "unacceptable" for migrants to return from Hungary when they are always getting more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, no damage to civilians.
The debate needs to be held in the near future with other countries and Brussels," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
There was confusion at the border between Hungary and Serbia after the 28 nationalities failed to create a common immigration policy at a fair meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibility for 40 000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece. Ministers had hoped to talk about reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - about which EU countries will take 120 000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
On Tuesday, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an extra EU summit to discuss the country's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act shortly.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation in two southern regions gave the authorities greater power to act in a crisis and allowed you to be closed and asylum law cases to be speeded up.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Sijáarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is complete, the country will also set up a part of the barbed wire fence against Romania in order to stop immigrants from flooding through the country.
CBS News correspondent, Charlie D'Aga, reports that even prisoners had been recruited to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the biggest bottle neck and a place of entry to the European Union for refugees, many of whom have escaped war on Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the people arriving are seeking a better life for economic refugees, and not the people fleeing the war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, are now defining a company over or undermining a four-metre (13 feet) barbed wire fence, built by the government to the southern border of Serbia and including longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"In view of the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian Government announces an emergency," the government informant Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the South Senegal City.
We are very clear about this: crossing the limit of the law is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally accept the deployment of the military expected next week, but at the border with Associated Press journalists have been seeing for days heavy armed military personnel with their vehicles and their dogs.
Gyorgy Bakonyi, domestic security advisor of Orban, said that the authorities had taken 45 people in their efforts to cross the border, as well as 15 countries that had already reached the ground.
They are now being held captive by the police and accused of breaking the new laws.
The authorities will quickly fix the fence.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two seven crossing points from the border against Serbia after they sent a train to shut down one of these places.
The main crossing point near the Hungarian Roske was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened up a small office in metal containers for human handling and the crowds came in.
About 20 got in, but thousands remained outside.
One group of immigrants was blocked by the main engines between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 elections: According to the national survey, Hillary Clinton's management in Bernie Sanders has narrowed half
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton will continue under the leadership of the two-digit Democrats in the appointment contest, but Senator Bernie Sanders will be against him.
Clinton is now supporting 47% of democratic voters (calculated by 58%), and Sanders, on the other hand, supports 27% (increased by 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will join the Presidential Competition, but he will support 15% of the democratic electorate.
More than five months before the start of the pre-elections, the majority of democratic voters say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
However, Clinton’s supporters stand more closely behind their own choice than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has decreased in several population groups since the CBS News Poll survey last month, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is very much in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity with men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's first journey to democracyists under the age of 50 has disappeared, and now he's on level with Sanders.
However, Clinton clearly leads with older voters.
Last month Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit century with liberals, but now Sanders manages this group with five percentage points.
About half of the country's democraticists say that they strongly support Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
The fourth one says that he will support him with certain reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not very surprising that the current supporters of Clinton are very likely to be very eager to support him.
The ideas are more confusing for those who are not currently in favour of Clinton - only one quarter would be zealously supportive of him.
Where 48% of the democratic voters say that they would be very supportive of Clinton, the Republican First Man of Donald Trump, the same is said to be the less-favoured Republican voter (35%).
When Clinton’s supporters were asked why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had the right experience (16%) and then the most popular answers were that this was the right time for the female president (13%) and that he was the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same views and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
As the Vice-President has an effect on the possible presidential rule, 57% of the democratic voters would like to see him in the race, even though one third disagrees.
When asking the Democrats who they would choose to appoint the second party, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton's supporters more than half says they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to reach out to the democratic candidates, Hilary Clinton's leadership will grow from Sanders. If Biden goes along, the management will be 20 percentage points, but if he doesn't go away, the number will be 30.
55% of democratic voters consider that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
On this scale Biden will be far away, but the proportion of those who hold him more voting has increased.
However, when the democratic voters were asked what was most important in the candidate, they raised their views above the vote.
Even last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered impossible for these voters.
The candidates or potential candidates of the Democrats will be very successful in certain key areas among the voters of their parties.
Most of them consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden can do the three best in honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
30 per cent of democratic voters say that Clinton does not consider honest and reliable, twice as much as Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent say they have no opinion about Sanders.
Democrat voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically agreed.
When we look at all these issues, about one quarter of the democratic voters say they have no opinion about Sanders.
While the personal e-mail address of Hillary Clinton and the use of the server as Minister for Foreign Affairs still raise questions, the majority of democratic voters are satisfied with his explanation of the matter and says that the matter was not affected by their public opinion on him.
However, it is different when we consider America as a whole.
Half the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about one third is satisfied.
In March, the people’s opinions were divided shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that their overall opinion about Clinton was not affected by e - mail work, even though 36 percent say that he has become worse.
More than six out of ten Republicans say that their opinion on Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him to be honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all the registered voters. Only 32% consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points from last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say that Clinton does not consider it honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 per cent of voters registered in the whole country do not regard Trumpic as being honest and reliable.
But both Clinton and Trump are considered to be very good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the investigation, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered to be the most honest.
Sanders are generally considered honest, but many people have no opinion of him, just as they do not of Carson.
The error margin in the study involving 351 democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaching Donald Trump in a national survey
Ben Carson will come near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
In the new survey, two candidates collected half of all their votes, leaving others to fight for their feet.
Throughout the country, the Republican voters are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen from 23% of the CBS poll on Tuesday before last month's Fox News election questionnaire to 27%.
However, Carson rose at the same time from 6 to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing very well with different demographic groups and that Trump is being excluded from the higher-level Republican voters.
After the rest of the field, apart from Carly Fiorina and Governor of Ohio John Kasichi, the support of Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin has fallen most: from 10% of last month to 2% today.
Former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio are in third position at 6 per cent.
The error margin of this latest survey in September in the sample of 376 Republican voters is +/– 6 %.
Last week's CNN/ORC survey published showed Carson's rise in the polls: he has 19% support for the Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him 32%.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was also significantly above Carson.
At Carson's popularity last week, Trump criticises the retired neurosurgeon for nothing, even though Carso apologized to the question of Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday on his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five fraternity members are charged with the death of Baruch College's first year student.
Almost two years after the death of a student in the brotherhood's brute ceremony in the Pokono Mountains district of Pennsylvania, the murder charge has been brought against five people.
The members of the Baruch College in New York City, Pi Delta Psi, brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the membership line in September 2013, and then delayed his hospitalisation, thus contributing to his death, the police stated.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a top of more than 13 kilos full of sand, and then he was repeatedly stamped on the ground when he tried to walk across the ice field toward the goal.
Finally, Deng complained that his head would hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
The brothers did not call the emergency number after Deng passed out, but, according to charges, they waited an hour before they brought him to the hospital, says the police.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, look for information on his symptoms and contact the national president of the brotherhood, Andy Meng, asking for advice, Chief of Police Chris Wagner, at the press conference.
"This is where the members began to hide their ritual equipment, and therefore practically put the brotherhood's welfare ahead of Michael Deng," said the Chief of Police Wagner.
Deng wasn't released, and he died the next morning.
According to the report, Deng received repeated boring artifact attacks on the head, body, and thigh.
"There have been too many families suffering from brotherhoodism, when every year at least one student has died since 1970", Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the family of Deng, said in his opinion.
Brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this step of authority is important.
The great jury in Monroe County advocated that the first five members are charged with the murder of a third degree.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent blasphemy and criminal plotting.
"We do not want to be responsible only for individuals. If there is an organisation behind the event that has accepted the situation either officially or informally, they must also be held accountable", Wagner stated at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College denied Brotherhood and National Brotherhood to disband their contact with the local department.
This is what happens when the U.S. Central Bank raises interest rates
There will be an increase in interest rates, and the emerging markets will fall, bond yields will rise, and the economy will have to decline.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take or how long it's gonna last.
The past does not give much help with timing, especially in the economy.
The return to recovery has taken only 11 months after the first lifting, sometimes it has been as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the U.S. Central Bank in raising interest rates has been often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets reacted.
Therefore, U.S. officials have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are being raised, but rather on the development of the time to normalise the situation.
Indeed, there are many variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the promotions related to the acquisition of interest have been oversized.
"The first increase after the global economic crisis in Keskusbank will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the 'bad money' era," said Capital Economics Global Economics chief economic expert, Julian Jessop, in a message to clients.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to normal, even though still low, to the level of the mutating shock that many feel afraid.
However, this does not mean that it has no effect.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react on the basis of past developments:
As has been seen on the market in the last about a month, waiting for interest rise can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It appears that capital output has a tendency to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy", Deutsche Bank's analysts said in a recent study about what is happening after the central bank's increase.
In more detail, in the last around 35 years, the market is generally strong at an increase of around 14%, after 250 days, the situation is rather flat (mean increase of 2.6%) and after 500 days the average return has been achieved in the last six cycles, multiplied by the latest analysis by the Nuveen Asset Management capital strategy of Bob Doll, published in Barron's magazine.
According to the Deutche Bank, the impact on the shares is generally more clear at the later stage of the interest cycle when outputs start to fall.
The recessions are part of the economic life, but interest purchases often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces a number of challenges that have not previously been met, which can speed up the recession.
This is particularly the gross national product, which will be closest to its lowest level of all time before the central bank's interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 rise in nominal annual GDP since 1950 has only been less than 4.5% twice.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 per cent, few believe it will remain, while the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, says the federal reserve bank in Atlanta.
The rise in interest rates in this fragile economic situation can be risky and raises the question of whether this is different," Deutsche Bank said.
The market participants have been looking forward to the central bank's increase throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategic and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept an increase at this meeting, only 25% of the likelihood of future trade is expected.
"Our research shows that from 1950 onwards, all growth cycles have so far experienced an increasing leverage effect in supersystems, where GDP has passed its peak before the recession very quickly after recovery has begun," the report says.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptional slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the period of observation.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been waiting overwhelmingly for the last recession to end: the record has been 35 months, and now there is 74 months already in progress.
A fixed return has also been unstable in the waiting for interest on the market, and the model reminds some of the observations made on capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects will be more visible in debt instruments than in shares.
The pattern of debt returns appears to be immediately variable for the first cycle increase/loop.
At the end of the interest cycle, debt returns fall immediately", Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategies believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a convergence of returns on longer and shorter-term debt securities, thus disproportionately increasing the rate of return.
High-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about finding returns", says Schwab’s fixed return analyst, Kathy Jones, in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's expectations.
"In addition to the fall in demand and inflation expectations, there are several indications that the market has adapted to more stringent monetary policy prospects," he wrote.
The short-term interest rates are high, the rate of return is even higher, the credit margins have increased and the instability has increased - all these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its course.
In general, companies whose business activity mainly invests in the United States win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt are less effective when the increase in dollar value makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have funding.
"Histeria shows that 'qualitys' shares are generally more profitable in the three months following the first interest rate," the Goldman Sachs analysts stated in their report.
After strong net sales, companies that have a strong turnover were overrun by an average of five percentage points following the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Enterprises with high return on capital and low-volatile shares did better than low-quality companies, with the average of 4 (percentage) and 3 (percentage) respectively.
It's gonna be a big problem.
Those companies that owe a lot of change rates are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in dollar value.
Farmers can also gain profits with higher returns, although experts disagree with how quickly they feel.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, Congressman Andrew Bingham says
Congressman Andrew Bingham charged the channel for 'reporting'
He claims that separating it from a commercial competitor will become more and more difficult.
In addition, he took his target for BBC Music Awards, saying that they were just mimicing the British Awards Awards.
Mr Collins, with the Congressman, criticises the Voice, saying that it is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is turning into "Classic FM", claims the leading representative, adding the pressure of the production company to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not do.
Commissioner Bingham also told the BBC leaders that the public service radio channel had an effect on its 'responsible' content and that it is increasingly difficult to separate it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "reporting" - is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took over the BBC Music Awards Prize, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, only looks like the British Awards, under different names.
So if you're trying to do something different, here's two examples I remember right here, when you actually just copied something already on the market," Bingham said.
The President of the BBC contested the allegations that BBC Radio 3 is much ahead of his commercial competitors as regards live music and the distribution of information to citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, first-class.
"In addition, I think it is really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel must work more than previously to reach the public because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of BBC's supply, which was criticised for entering commercial competitors' toes during the consultation of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A conservative member of the Tory Party, Damien Collins, criticises The Voice, a musical contest that BBC bought from a Dutch production company Talpa Media, estimated at 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and is not unique?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, in which Paloma Faith and Boy George functioned as star stars, was produced in "sightly BBC style".
He added that he wanted the production company "to find success inside his own house" the next time it started a entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of future The Voice periods or to impose the money of the licensees on other forms of entertainment.
The net sales rose the least so far in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Net sales rose by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
The increase in last month was low after the start of statistics in 2000
Three years ago online sales confirmed the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday may slow down consumption
Virtual shopping has grown tremendously for more than a decade and has transformed many of Britain’s shopping bags into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a deterioration in online sales in the air, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total August consumption grew least since the start of statistics in 2000: only 5% increase last year.
Experts say that there are indications of a decrease in online sales in the air, when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If we look at the growth levels of previous years and return to 2000, it was clear that the situation would improve over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the JMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales were confirmed when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that many people made online shopping, and that they could be made in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it is balanced, and (growth) can be calculated.
The Black Friday phenomenon from America has been regarded as one of the reasons behind slow shops.
Experts believe that consumers will control shopping before the last Friday of November.
Last year, the average of five times more buyers balvele their computers to pick up shops by knocking down the website of many traders.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who got the buyers fighting about the findings, can control shopping.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium revealed that only about one of five of the five were used online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now made from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of using the fashion chains of shopping bags.
The Muslims are burying sanctions against the family of the Mecca Apocalypse.
The Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly accused the collapse of the construction waste Saudi Binlad Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured when the crane broke down.
29 dead men were carried across the streets, and hundreds of Muslims gathered together to bury them. The victims died when the crane collapsed in Mecca's great housekeeper.
Most of the white-dressed deaths filled the route to honor the first dead who made their final journey to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
The sad course passed a sacred place where only a few days ago the upheaval fell through the roof of the mosque and destroyed the worshipers.
The bodies were released to be buried when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed that Bin Laden’s building group was responsible for a disaster involving 394 people.
The killing of the upheavals that fell in the masser of Mekka was carried across the streets by 29 bodies of worshipers.
Among the dead were the father of four children from Qasim Akram Bolton, Manchester, who was the first of his saints when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in a large house with his parents before the start of the annual break-up.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that the hair of Mecca will continue when thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binlad Group should not have left the crane up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the decision, published by Saudi Press Agency, led by the state, said that Binlad Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English service of the News Office did not mention this detail, but it said that company leaders are prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week Salman swore to find out what caused the fall of the cranes to fall in a large mound yard where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had been gathered before the break-off to be held later this month.
The Binlad Group has not published any notices of the collapse of the throat, and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The royal decision also accused the association that it did not use up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with meteorologists.
There are dozens of cranes around the Mekka majormaja, which are part of the huge building robbery led by Binlad Group.
The Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia’s ruler family for decades, leading to major construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a rebel boy whose family banned it in the 1990s.
The ruin occurred in wind and rainy weather only days before millions arrive in the kingdom for a holy spirit that every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
The authorities say that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a million dollars (74 000 pounds) for the owners of the dead and permanently injured persons.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
The B&Q popo says that the Eastern Europeans work cheaply behind popularity
The British are increasingly using assistant services, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country
Author Rupert Steiner, head of town correspondent for Daily Mail
Britts are said to give up their hammers and goals and to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home shopping
It seems that if you're right-handed with a hammer or start painting walls, you're in a minority now.
You see, the British hire more and more helpers to do tea-sex-work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of the home repair chain, Veronique Laury, said that behind popularity, the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a blatant price.
This leads to Kingfisher planning to open up 200 new sales for workers and close down 60 B&Q shops.
Laury said that she wanted more women to work at B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions are specifically made by more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that the changes in the population need to be taken into account: today there are more than one woman's economies, where more household purchases are made than before.
Laury said, "There are still men on the part of our salesmen.
We need to get a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the decision to buy products is made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of the five women who lead the most important companies in the UK FTSE100 index, who have restructured their management team with equal numbers of male and female men.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with a group of nearly 50% of women, including its Director-General and Financial Director.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - the difference is important here.
It hasn't been hard to find good women in the management team."
Kingfisher reported the invoice both in the production and sales of six months after the Group took over the costs of closing down sales.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, who owns Recrewfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new moves
The three-year government decided to resort to forceful legislation in order to save the country's economy.
After all, the effects were quite rapid.
The sharp head of SAK’s and other employees’ center organisations began to force the country to stand on Friday because of the widespread demonstration of workers.
A lot of people think that there is also reason at that time.
Let's see if it's worth strike while it's going to go bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50,000 people on the Internet have already reported that they are not going to take part in the demonstration but go to work.
In old times of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but openly declaring a criminal would have been a small human political suicide.
A few tens of thousands of trade unions do not have a long time to protest, but it gives a reason for thinking.
The position of the trade union is no longer as obvious as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, government brutal solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years, when things have seemed to be rolling with their own weight, then there is finally a point in the alliances, i.e. the rights of the employee to defend, visibly and properly.
This is how the government may want to take the role of ay movement, when membership in the trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary than ever.
Let us be of no opinion about the activities of organisations, so it is a waste of time that Friday's demonstration of mind might somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has already fallen for 31 months.
Gross domestic product continues to decline, with unemployment rising.
These are the things that you would think would force everyone's head.
Hard savings for University of Lappeenland: Objective 8.5 million savings, reduction of personnel by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenland begins a savings period with the aim of obtaining a total cost of EUR 8,5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will launch the entire staff-related negotiations with a savings target of 6.5 million annually.
In practice, it means reducing about 130 employees.
In addition, two million will be spent on other activities.
In the light of the Yt negotiations, the 2016 budget is expected to be 8,5 million deficits.
It is also affected by the government’s grant operations.
In this financial year, the university will make some 2.6 million deficit results.
The expenditure will increase slightly next year, but funding from the same Ministry will be reduced by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The overall budget of the University is about 85 million euros, so the saving target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive teaching and research cuts and the reduction of company funding on our university is very important, says Principal Anneli Pauli in the University's release.
Before the summer, the impact of cuts was even more moderate, but the reduction in additional funding now appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with the trustees will be launched next week on Tuesday and will last for six weeks.
Yle: Happy wants to see Finnish railways
The owner of Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in going along with Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the UK's largest railway companies, says Souter.
Rail transport should be gradually opening up to competition.
The first is close traffic in the capital region in 2017-2018.
After nearby traffic, long-distance traffic is in place.
Souter tells me he's already approaching the Ministry of Transport.
According to Ylen, the Ministry of Transport welcomes the plans for Onnibus.
Other international companies have also reported their interest in rail transport at least in Transdev (ex Veolia), which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
The U.S. Central Bank must take decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world follows on the page when the US Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesdays and Thursdays to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
At the time of Reuters' survey to 80 economic scientists, slightly more than half of those who still believed last week to raise interest rates, now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and the interest rates are maintained at the current 0-0.25%.
This is an historic event, because when the central bank cut interest rates to zero, it is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero levels and to start normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute of Economics.
The U.S. economy has worked relatively well, and recovery has brought over billions of dollars in balance sheets, and has created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore any less rose global views.
It has warned the market that they should be ready to rise, but the signs also show that they believe that there is an increase in probability.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20.00 (CET).
Delta State University shooter left an apology message
After his girlfriend was shot in Mississippi on Monday morning before his colleague later shot on the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was "bad" about the first murder and hoped that "you could cancel it," they told the authorities on Tuesday.
Missionary Gautier police told me that Lamb called 911 at about 10 a.m. A.M.
Monday, she told me she's shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send constables to his home.
He said that he "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there was a "soul dog" in the house, which "it doesn't bother anyone", but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller for this name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, there was the body of a 41-year-old Amy Prentisss, and a message written by a 45-year-old Lamb that read: "I am so sorry that I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing a message, Lamb drove almost 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt before he finally killed himself late on Monday when he was surrounded by the police.
The university principal William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt to know that there was something in his mind.
On Tuesday, the authorities said that, despite the claims published on Monday, that Mr Prentiss had believed that he had been in relation to Schmidt, there was no "invoicing information or proof" of any type of "three-fold".
Shawn O'Steen told me he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as "good man."
A couple divorced 15 years ago, but stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who's "supervised".
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and his daughter were "all their best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked hand-in-hand online. Sun Heraldi said that Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police said that Lamb called his relatives somewhere near Monday to tell them that "I'm not going to jail".
When the police reached Lamb's highway on 1 near Greenville the same night later, Lamb stopped his car by the side of the road, left it and went running into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about education from Delta State in the spring of 2015, explaining the CV found on the University’s website.
The stars that lost their charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has been hard in recent years.
In 2001 he was ill with leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The rumor is that he also had drug problems, and in 2008, he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this really takes its taxes.
Manchester United Luke Shaw is out for months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw had a double fracture in his right leg at the loss of Manchester United to the PSV Eindhoven in the league of the Masters.
Even though the defender is on the ride and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury caused Héctor Moreno's unsupervised charge by 15 minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw had crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the field and had to give him oxygen before taking him to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his leg and he's in the hospital now."
He'll be moved tomorrow or maybe the day after that, and then he'll be cut in Manchester.
This is terrible, and the boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18, he's suffering from trouble and then he's playing great, and this is what happens.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She cried.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes me at least six months, and she's not playing block.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he received a red card and a penalty shot.
Errtomari Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that an Italian contractor be mistaken.
You can personally judge the situation when I say that it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-leg guarantee.
Shaw twiittat reads as follows: "Thank you for all your messages, the words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Subject: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw's case and loses to the PSV.
An English defender has an additional incentive to recover next June of the European Championships in France.
PSV Coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out for this kind of injury, they're all very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend the opponent.
Moreno's leg broke when he played in Mexico's team against Van Galal's Holland in the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this hard because the aim is not to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's tail.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after Chris S modeling challenged him.
I guess David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Each parent will soon learn one thing: If your child loves a book, it will not last long before it is almost learned outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the holiday-time childcare service asked the Prime Minister for his favorite children's book, he chose the Dr. Seussin The Lorax book, an environmental protection story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps website and goes on: "Huska, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book for my children because it always seems to have a picture or message that we've never seen before."
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, where Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details had been added to fill out a fairly short original text.
"In the town of Tarville, in which all nature has disappeared and even air is a commodity, the Ted boy hopes to win his dream girl's heart by filling in the hope of seeing the right tree", the text says and describes the love story that Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, did not write from the right name Theodor Seuss Geizel.
If this isn't suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds like it was taken from the plotting of the Lorax movie on the Internet Movie Database, which begins as follows: "In the town of Tarville within the walls, where everything is artificial and even air is commercial, the Ted boy hopes to win his dreams over Audrey's daughter's heart."
Considering that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would have had such an inexplicable book drink. In it, a young, anonymous boy will hear how local nature has destroyed greedy, wood-sucking and needs of Kerskanen, without passing on to the story of the short, fictitious creature named Lorax, which is "cleans for trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably an external assistant, who apparently has never read the book 20 times in a row for a child.
The secretary-general said the text must have come from Cameron's electoral office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameron's staff, but no further comment was made at the moment.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being missed by the English team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan is a tough task in the Arab Emirates, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I do not think it is likely to happen to repeat the last 3-0 series destruction.
I wouldn't shut down the guest victory, either.
Alastair Cook's side can be less experienced than a three-year-old team, but it has good spinners and a strong way of thinking: they have no scars from 2012, only young positives.
Moeen Ali develops in its rotations and Adil Rashid is an attack option, even though there is an unknown factor at this level.
Subject: Adam Lyth dropped from the British Cricket Team, replaces Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is clearly difficult to analyse for me because I'm his chief coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against the attackers under challenging circumstances, and simple but bear the truth is that the critics are appreciated on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the announcement, because, as I have said before, players are the best of choice.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he himself was responsible for his own destiny.
I hope if he gets more runaways for Yorkshire, another chance will come up.
Even when he did not perform as well as he could, and it does not surprise me. Lyth is above all a teamman.
It's hard to answer the question of how long the hit man gets to leave a trail.
Lyth was elected to the team seven times, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was chosen nine times.
Only Compton was given the opportunity to play both at home and at guests.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trot first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top condition, but the lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming with me, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
He is a critical player of what we saw early in Yorkshire during this period when he made 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this certainly depends on the team's composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen has been hit by the idea of having an extra feeder on the field, and I am not against it.
I don't understand why the player can't hit there, and this left hand has already shown himself to be quite a critic.
Moeen did not necessarily perform his assignment in his Greece at Worcestershire, but he is three to them and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games in the fall of his first hip before he moved to the opening in 2001.
He did three hundred points right away, and he didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a thief, and, a little bit of what I've been dealing with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unpunished statistics hitting an average of 31, with a ball of 35 and think it's a gambling game, but there aren't too many baiters and electors to choose young people.
He'll learn a lot with this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach's side.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan hitter M chain Jayawardene as consultant in the games can prove to be a genius.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game, and he brings a huge amount of experience, because he's done everything in every situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in with the white ball games, bringing both energy and an unsatisfied blasphemy.
I've always thought that he was born to be involved in international crises, whether it was playing or training, and he's got a lot of crazy things to use like Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's team camp in Durham, Ben Stokes, is being put to rest in one day, and Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, coaching and choosing do not make schedules.
And you must remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on a light basis.
British departures from the EU (Brexis) can take profit if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's half-bodied renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU will become more and more difficult every day, even if it does not even take into account the hearty Jeremy "Yes or not?" Corbyn's choice of the Labour Party's leadership or the failure of the trade union to Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farags.
The European diplomatic partner recently explained that, since the EU is so far in a variety of crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of the British self-centred agenda, which is full of dissatisfactions and disruptive contractual changes that these countries do not most want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Organisation of Trade Unions decided that they would not want them if they were to break social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's self-evident agent.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, either with or without a local eyemaker, and then coming home, saying that they will win the supporters for the reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside the British EU tent, "Don't leave us alone with France", is said to be saying from Berlin, that the shortest ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where we don't care if we don't leave.
German careful and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but he has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his work in the same way as he did for too long for Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France is facing a re-election or replacement of François Holland in 2017.
He's a walking force, too.
Poland may soon have a national right-wing government, a left-wing Spanish government.
It's hard to see these countries sacrifice for the Selfiebrits, when their energy should rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they don't want it because of similar separatist trends.
So, my friend puts it, some of these ministers can even deliberately plan to make useless remarks by the Scottish National Party style in the UK during the 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiation was a case" and "The renegotiation of the negotiations had nothing to do with Britain."
Europeans have been hard to experience how greedy Fleet Street's newspaper know how to be and how the EU-sceptical press's exclusive powers were, which they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership began in 1973 was strengthened in the age of 2:1.
They can easily remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist who named themselves "EU Direct Bananas" when he was a Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a book - booking group of strangers, telephone hacking foreigners, and persons who have their place of residence elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same thing about them, but she realized that if you're in a cage with a lusty gorilla, bananas should be given up for a blizzard, unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later on dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blarirish than Blair himself, as regards the opposition to Cameron's renegotiation, namely, Bair had accepted the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgived him either.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me in the Westminster House on Monday (I told him that he had no time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-enacting Neil Kinnock's 80s strategy for Murdochi, which was a mistake both then and now.
Even though it may take time, however, he has to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not with me, but no doubt Andrew Marri, whose BBC attack Corby left on Sunday.
The official role of Corbyn in Europe is beautifully, evolving.
He says that he would like us to remain in the renewed EU.
Well, most of the people outside the British Independent Party are certainly behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fan" Benn said this both on the radio and on TV this week when his internal patrolman wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint a fugitive John McDonald as Minister of Finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father-in-law was squeezing on TV, trying to be unspeakable to the government of the working party without going so far as to lose his government position.
Hilary was more attractive.
But the fight for us to remain "in any event" - the Benny statement - was not what McDonald said, and for everything that Corby told the principals and the people at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever it is, the unhikered, emotional and personal image Corby wants to convey (repeat that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important during the period of the 24-hour television, and in particular in social media circles, which is an acceptable growth platform for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonald has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to support the working party in the referendum campaign for himself.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
However, the basic rotation of McDonald and Corbyn concerning EU membership (and in line with their Benn-lagged economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate with left-wing thinkers, who are at the heart of the dogm's opalism.
As for his two-dividence with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to surrender), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they even have suspicious voters) awarded to Britain when it can be completely futile?
The United States has already been somewhat disappointed in the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the regime that cuts even the cost, as I was mentioned on Monday at the initiative of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England's electrical tobacco assessment
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency’s claim that electric cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional ones was the beginning of a 12-person meeting, with some contacts with the tobacco industry.
The experts who wrote British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed to the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) in the report on electricity tobacco.
In the last month, the PHE published this 'virtant seal' report, describing it as a "ready review of evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and referred to contacts between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, Lance published a final report that attacked PHE’s main ruling against the ‘exemptive hutera base’.
Two other researchers in BMJ have wondered whether the arguments are "constructed on rock or sand."
Professor Martin McKee of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Professor of Clinical Epidemiology of the University of Liverpool Simon Capewell say: "The main principle of public health is that the policies should be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects that the claim of the PHE 'at present best estimate, electric tobaccos are about 95% less harmful than traditional tobacco' is based on a detailed assessment and modeling of the evidence.
In fact, it will come from one of the 12 meetings that developed the multi-criminal decision-making model (MCDA) to synthesize the disadvantages of their opinions, combined with products containing nicotine, and the results of this meeting were concentrated in research.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which is reported to have previously received funding from the British American Tobacco company for independent research.
He also supported BAT's public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people in the meeting announced that he had received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not from the funding he was told that he had received from Philip Morris International earlier.
The selection criteria for members of the panel are not reported, but the panel includes a number of well-known producers of electricity tobacco, some of which also indicate that they have obtained funding in the area of research.
Others who were present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the Director-General for Tobacco from PHE.
The study carried out by the group "responsibly admits" that there is a lack of "undisputed evidence of disadvantages in most of the products and most of the criteria", McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell claim that "there is no evidence that electric tobacco is a route for burning children or non-commokers".
Professor Kevin Fenton, Head of PHE's Health and Welfare, says that earlier BMJ's arguments have been answered.
He says, "The tobacco is considerably less harmful than burning."
Half of those who burn their lives die of addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electricity tobacco are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what evidence appears and what it does not seem, particularly when there is so much public awareness of relative risks compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die every year from smoking-related illness and smoking costs NHS 2 billion pounds annually.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even if the electric tobaccos are not harmless, their disadvantages are just part of the damage to traditional tobacco - we will meet our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Luke Johnson, former Chairman of Channel 4 said that the BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "do anything" of a grade such as this sort of soap show on Albert Square Street.
Johnson said that the concession fees should only be used to produce programmes that other British broadcasters do not.
He criticises BBC's placing public service programmes that are likely to have fewer audiences, difficult broadcasting times, against more likely programmes and channels than BBC4.
After Tony Hall of BBC said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said that he had experienced Channel 4 for six years to create a relationship with BBC, in vain.
"I do not understand the idea that BBC produces and sends programmes that would clearly fit non-substantial competitors," Johnson said to the Committee on Communications of the Upper Room as part of its research on the future of BBC.
If the licence fee is held - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this message or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not do or bring.
The Voice will be sent to the most important transmission time, because its future will be supported as much as possible.
The idea that no one else would show the program is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously stupid.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why the progressive tax should finance programmes that could also be financed without State aid.
The Voice is one of those and EastEnders is the other, without denying the inside of the house been implemented.
To be honest, other channels would give anything about it.
I don't understand how it's about sending a public service.
I don't think it would weaken BBC at all."
Channel 4 leading serialist Johnson in 2004-2010 said that BBC is responsible for hunting audiences 'cause of the goals of people working in these countries, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support'.
He commented on BBC's most popular series reminds me of the comments made by former Sky Director Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTagart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that BBC sell series like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the public service programmes of BBC's smaller audience "are going to BBC4, where often it is impossible to measure the number of viewers, but BBC thus fulfils its responsibilities and can then buy 4 billion pounds of promising income in defence of the pretext of saying 'of course we are doing all these unknown programs that no one sees'.
They'll put them on the embassy where no one will ever be able to look at them.
With regard to the licence fee, Johnson said to the committee: "I will make you look for a more aggressive system in the world that gets the most value from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year will get a lot of value, but I don't know if that's true for people who have 150 pounds of money because they don't use BBC much.
David Elstein, former Director of Sky and Channel 5 who also proved to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-assemble its early task "to inform, train and entertain".
He said that only a small part of BBC's production is now classified as education - he said that the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should be modelled on Australian and Canadian broadcasting, and that it should be changed to "information, election and entertain".
With regard to the partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which, according to him, only some people are being shown on TV, and be associated with commercial companies so that all of them can be viewed online.
"Audio genetics" allows the management of brain cells by means of audio waves
The video shows how the shuttle mats change direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Researchers have raised worms that have genetically engineered nervous systems to control them with sound waves.
Little shuttles change direction as soon as they hit the sound pulse that is too high to hear the human ear.
The pulses function by switching on genetically engineered motion nerve cells with ultrasonic responses to the membranes.
Subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said that worms show the functioning of a new method called sound genetics, which can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that one day the method could replace a deep-brained simulation, an invasive measure in which people's brains are driven by electrical pulses to treat Parkinson's disease.
The shuttles did not normally respond to the ultrasound, but Chalasan found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the doves confirmed ultrasonic waves that then go into the worms.
The increased ultrasound waves affect the structures of the TRP-4-ion channels, which are in some worm cell membranes.
The sound waves allow these ion channels to open up and activate the cells attached to them, reports the Nature Communications report.
In order to produce ultrasonic controlled shuttles, Chalasan has genetically engineered worms so that part of their motion nerve cells is the TRP-4-ion channels.
When Chalasan used ultra-reformed worms, the microspheres confirmed the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms in which they switched on the modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some features similar to optogenetics, a pioneer tool that allows scientists to switch nerve cells on and off using light pulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sociogenics can have some advantages compared to optogenetics.
Unlike a light that has to be sent from the optical fiber along the desired point of the brain, low-speed ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unattractively, so they can be sent to the brain at the head of the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic virus, it can be possible to get targeted human nerve cells to react instantaneously to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
An illegal torture device delivered to your home!
Advantage to the shame of British arms trade
Look at the video against Amnesty International weapons fairs.
Horrible killer machines!
Neck-breaking leg blades!
Rice bombs!
And electronic know-how pumps that cause pain but do not leave any trace!
The joyous voice and comic book language of comic books leave no doubt that this advertising of the world's largest weapons fairs is a sharp parody, which Amnesty International produced in order to stress the willingness of the British government to trade weapons for repression governments in the Defence and Security Equipment International ExCeL Centre at a party in London's shipyard area.
Subject: DSEI arms fairs: authoritarian regimes arriving in London
As a result of a special campaign, many posters appeared for bus stops and subways, which require more accurate access.
"Serious information, are you travelling on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" together, you will be asked using London's underground font and brand, as the DLR track becomes the picture of the tank.
In this September, a bunch of arms dealers arrive on the DLR route... customers are asked to help stop the weapons fairs.
These 300 posters are made by artists who were present at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (in the museum of the plans of the public).
The collective called Special Patrol Group helped spread posters all over London using the Ad Space Hack Packs package. This is a six-pack package of six-packed six-packed six-packs with "to the third-third of the advertising space for bus stops on the planet".
Transport for London is not interested in this unauthorized "public vandalism".
One of the parodia commercials produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to the Cruel Designs curator and the University of Essex journalist Gavin Grindon, artists are asking more and more questions, and they want to take political work to non-parliamentary audiences.
Many artists have started working with activists on resistance lines when they realize that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another poster against arms trade greets business travelers in the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed through Facebook over 100 000 times in the last 24 hours. It created free advertising office VCCP, and also the graphic designer and browser worked for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever found that weapons fairs were not advertised at all - and even ExCeL's calendar was an empty point - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They used to play the idea of a more realistic form of corruption, but "it was more important to stop it with bright colors and animation".
"They've done fantastic work helping us to raise questions about the illegal torture device sold at fairs," says Amnestyn Tom Davies.
Now the British Government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally sold near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art in the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL when exhibitors trade fantasticly decorated products.
In his press release, he was ordered by the U.S. Army to launch the AT4CS RS.
This includes "a unique tube setting to target excellent effects behind the panzer".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dwelling
It's been 11 years since I was an unknown 19 years old, and I still believed in barettes and moral relativism, but only now I remember the violent smiles of people I've been agitated and numerous long complaints I remember.
Most of my studies can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving to the apartment can be anything that goes to the nerves completely scary.
It's tempting to say where you're from, did you keep the mid-term and where you think of Corbyn, and why "I really don't love or hate Marmite because it's really just a sweat in my room".
Take a breath.
And help others to draw spirit, ask questions, and show interest.
It guides the discussion and helps you find the people you like, and not those you would like to talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and they would divide fires.
Give people room.
People’s rooms are often converted into cocktails, entertainment places and high entertainment guides, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Subject: Don't even think you're starting a university while you're in a relationship
The university is a tough place for the introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but in many residential areas there is a culture of walking from one room to another, which is friendly, social and causes long-lasting friendships.
It could mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say 'I will hold on to you and I want to be friends with you, but you need to leave now so that I can collect back the energy I spent in my conversation with you'.
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
Cracking when the speech comes: knock.
A guy in my student apartment thought that if the door wasn't locked, he had been invited in.
He saw quite a bit of things.
Befriend yourself through the bakery.
Since you start at the university in the top of the bakery, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate sandwichboard and presenting yourself to some degree seems less strange, less "healthful in the neighborhood, I rested on you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" -50-s.
The offer of self-doers is a great way to be friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk, and it may be that they will then combine your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you know about bread.
Badly mixed flour-sugar-fats are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Obviously, taking someone's chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a little milk in your tea?
Ask and check the owner of the milk.
It's possible that they'll give you permission, even if they're climbing inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathy, but try to face it more adult than my apartment mate who mixed up her milk with detergents to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You're not supposed to make noise so people don't get to sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial boat blowing a cat.
In my hall, the girl asked her neighbor if they could call her drum and bass music later, because she had three in the morning and she had a exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally slowed down at 5:00 in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before making their own music bloated, locked their doors and left for three hours.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future mate had to move into the same apartment with you?
Or, in turn, would it not be incredibly awkward if you considered your roommate to be your future spouse, you would come together, differ, and then you would see him every day and possibly lose all your friends to him?
Of course the heart wants what you want, but if a hot roommate really isn't your future spouse, you might even try to make sense of yourself.
At the moment of joy, when you realize that someone has left their keys in his locked room, the border between masquerading and bullying is more vulnerable than it seems.
Good job is fun, but it's possible to cancel in a moment.
You can give the safety of useful and fun teaching by hiding something, but never mess up a room with a toothpaste and a shampoo.
Lock their doors and put the keys in the water glass, and then put them in the freezer, but don't stick their property on the blue star roof like you've got twice.
A racist strike at the place of residence of foreign students in Kite - The house as reception center was stunned in Salo
On Saturday morning a racist strike was taken at the foreign students' headquarters in Kite, North Karelia.
Unlike the police earlier, this is not the accommodation facilities of minors' asylum seekers, but the sleep facilities of foreign students in Finland, says Heidi Luukäinen, a teacher at the Estonian National School of Evankelinen.
The windows and walls of the National School's accommodation were stunned by racist signs, such as hakaristas, and a metal object had been thrown through one of the accommodation windows, says the police in Eastern Finland.
According to the Luukkainen, responsible for social security training at the National School, there were an estimated ten people at the time of the attack.
"There was a weekend and adult people are free to move, and some could have been elsewhere," Luukinen says.
People from 12 different nationalities are housed at the National School.
They are students who have already been in Finland for some time, as well as those who have recently arrived for asylum.
All the people in the dirty building have a set of statuss.
Some study at an adult basic school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," says Lukanen.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time for a foreign country that has been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to the verse, students were given an information meeting on Monday, including the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to go away.
We've had tens of years of foreign students, and this is the first time that something like this happens," Luukinen says.
According to a bunch of people, the mess's already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men were suspected of being in the factory, and they had been on the move with a light passenger car.
I think that this is the top of the youth weekend when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," Luukukinen says.
There is also a hospital in Salo, where a reception centre has been set up.
The case happened last week.
He told me about it on his MTV website on Tuesday night.
The hospital wall had been drawn by a hammer and written in English "You are not welcome".
A criminal record has been made to the police.
Amendment 15.9. at 16.02 Revised police information on the age and status of people living in the building.
The state will stop Y-junna's Karja, the passengers in their throats, "the old idiots."
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepor's Karjaa ceases to travel in March.
The new train was agitated by passengers on the early nights of the train at Helsinki main railway station.
In particular, the downside is hitting on the civilians, said Torbjörn Bengtström, in the municipality.
It's just idiotic, because the number of inhabitants is growing all the time and people who work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be closed to anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says that HSTV's interview video is coming with a tractor to the capital.
There are also train changes elsewhere in the Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main track are combined into a new R line.
The station of Purola in Järvenää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula is out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR published information on the routes that the Ministry will purchase train services during the next contract period.
The contract period will change at the turn of the year and the rest of the routes will be in the country as a whole.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in autumn, will later be adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
The Siuntio, Bengtström, considers that the state train course is short-sighted.
We make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeated in a very systematic way.
Then we'll turn on the roof.
The Y train is also used by non-raaseporians and citizens, because it is fast and pass several stations.
In Espoo Annina Pöyryä felt the fate of travelers further away from the city area on the train.
"It's very bad for those who have to plan their journey again," he said in hurting the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
There must be a new train connection to the beach track, which will replace Y-jun in the area of HSL, which will take you to Kirkkonum.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. practically for municipalities and their taxpayers.
"We are now going to find out different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs carefully.
Rihtniemi tells us that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million dollars a year for the Y train, the Ministry has certainly much more for this.
The R-line on the main track leaves two positions between them.
Instead, the number of trains in Ainola and Saunakallio doubles.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease across the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuru and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinajoki.
The Piksämäki-Joensu route is shortened into the route of Pieksämäki-Varkus.
The trains are reduced on the routes of Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million journeys are made per year, while the total number of services purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring the state's annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote in the Book of Capital Time: "Marxin is worthy of study"
The crises in the global economy have brought Karl Marx (1818-1883) to the surface and his main work, published in 1867-1894, to the Capital of Marx, the former president of GDP, writes in the book Yrjö Hakane published today.
"He is now taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his speech.
Marx’s estimates of capitalist economic development, internationalisation and intrusion have proved to be an amazingly remote one for all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money and imaginary capital.
A list of books based on the Capital Seminars organised by Hakas is also provided by Professor Aalto University, a respected economic owner, Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx's current "butt and forever".
I mean, isn't the former CEO of the Business Research Institute and the Business delegation a Marxian?
No, no, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not think Marx is a timely economic thinker, but rather an interesting socialist.
Today social sciences have been distinguished and specialized, but Marx was a philosophy, historian, sociologist, economic scientist, journalist, political agitator, and hours of literature.
"The real idea is that the theory of the dead men tells about wrong opinions," Korkman starts.
It's true that Marx's predictions were hard to deal with.
While Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the initial art of capitalism, Korkman wondered.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical position.
"The most relevant in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again we are discussing Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to anyone who wants to understand a big picture, as a result of a technical upheaval to change the world", Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is no help from Marx.
In his view, capitalism was an hopeless case that should only be stopped.
Still, Marx is in the opinion of Korkman to get to know him.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't read," says Korkman.
"The Mamans and Trotskis and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more of each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political weight of the back years.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's thinking world, like other classics," says Korkman.
The United Nations is calling for war crimes in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes in Sri Lanka, reports AFP.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report is accused of war crimes both by Sri Lankan armed forces and by the rebels known as Tamils.
In the civil war in Sri Lanka, at least 100 000 people are estimated to have died.
Even the number of victims is not accurate.
In particular, in the last months of the long war, the major attack of armed forces in 2009 should be properly investigated, and the UN report calls for this.
The Sri Lankan armed forces report accused of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely to be men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of coercion of by-laws and children as fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to conduct an investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice because foreign judges.
In the UK yo test, you were able to redecorate social media.
On Wednesday, in the autumn, there was a long foreign language that was mostly English.
His skills were tested by over 16,000 experiments.
Even if it was an experiment, it could be written about social media.
Based on his experience, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of 150-250 words in English could point to the keeper of the web page.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for the rest of Leelia, Finland.
She had to ask for advice on how parents should also look at matters for young people.
There were four subjects of the substance, one of which had to be chosen.
"It was the hardest of them", assessed the third topic of Porvoo's Swedish-speaking high school in English by Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was just a commitment from the former President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso.
The fourth topic, Lybeck said it was nice.
It had to write a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school has been trained to write words," Lybeck says and estimates the whole experiment as "mell normal".
In Finnish or Swedish - English experience, questions were answered about texts that included, for example, the adaptation of the summer hat to climate change and the processing of large pools of information.
On Wednesday, a certain length of Russians were also written (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The autumn articles continue on Friday, when there is another domestic or Swedish or Finnish test.
The test is organised normally in the upper secondary schools, i.e. the mood of the employees does not affect it.
The University College invites them to test for appropriate transport connections in time to get to the trial.
Further time may be provided if it can be demonstrated that delays were not due to their own negligence.
The deal was robbed in Oulu, under threat.
On Wednesday morning, a shop was robbed in Oulu.
According to the police, the robber had been dressed in dark clothes and a commando box covering his face.
He's normal and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a gun and received a small amount of money for the prey movement.
We're looking into this as a serious robbery.
Police prepare for the arrival of thousands of protestors in Helsinki - Support teams from elsewhere in Finland
The protest against government surgical decisions will be blocked by the Helsinki Centre on Friday, predicting the police.
According to preliminary data, even tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of SAK, Akka and STK's associations will meet at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The task of the police at work is not only to carry out alarms and other police activities, but also to ensure the smooth functioning of the giant animal manifestation.
The road leading to the railway service shall be closed from motor vehicles for about 9.30 a.m. to 14.
Only alarm vehicles are released to the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off from Kaisaniemi’s traffic circle, west of Mannerheim.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
For now, at least it looks like it's enough.
I'm not taking a position on the police's fight.
According to Kujala, support teams from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki because of the demonstration.
The exact patrol officer won't tell me.
"Some of us are coming, but as a rule, we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
Police are calling for a private car to be avoided in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic pump extends from Hakaniemi level to the core centre.
It is expected that standing traffic will be expected from morning to early evening.
With protestors from elsewhere in Finland, many orders are also coming to Helsinki.
They won't be released to the Railways.
Buses leave time at a distance.
The rest of the trip is then to walk to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The expression also stops Helsinki’s public transport.
From the police's point of view, there's also a positive side.
The issue of the smooth running of public transport, which is normally at the hands of these large crowds, is now dealt with in a part by itself.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government's economic policy may be in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the demonstration to go smoothly.
After all, people are ordinary people who work or are unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are rational and peaceful people," Kujala says.
There will also be local demonstrations on Friday in different parts of Finland.
In many ways, Friday’s demonstration of mind is exceptional. Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations of mind?
The great demonstration of professional marriages on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good benchmark for Finnish political history, says Professor Emeritus Martti Siisiinen of Sociology at Jyväskylä University.
It's no wonder the Ay movement protested.
If it didn't do that, it would raise your hands in front of the government, says Sisiainen.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the Finnish corporate tradition, as well as the points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard grips are missing contract law.
There are a lot of features here that are really trying to get ay business on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a seat to look at the mirrors.
For example, mirrors are needed because there is no support from all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
The new one is now the steep division in which the demonstration of mind results among the ones that the Ay movement would like to be involved in the demonstration.
The unemployed from all over Finland showed their opinion at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a benchmark for Friday's demonstration of mind, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, says Mustrostorsti in 1993.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostoristi collected one 20 000 unemployed.
The government of Esko Ahon, which is the centre of the world, is coming up from a labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and the employees' organisations was never as bad as during the Aho porvari government.
Now, perhaps even worse than the time of Murrostorsta between the government and the Ay movement.
Besides, there is now a very high level of dust government in Finland, says Siisiinen.
The present government coalition is still so interesting that it is such a strict right, despite the words of the basic Finns.
There were certain elements of the old labor movement at the time of the hurdle.
Several thousand protestors are expected on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and possibly closes day care centres and schools.
Even though the demonstration does not receive the undivided support of employees, it can become the greatest for years.
In Helsinki, about 300 demonstrations have been organised annually in recent years.
They're out of range.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Ay movement in Finland have been quite peaceful, even though the way in which they have worked has grown in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is legal.
Preachers seek to avoid damage or destruction of property, says Sisiainen.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The demonstration culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on them.
The strike of firemen lasted three months in 1998.
Among other things, there were spectacular strikes with pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical lakes of the 1970s
The main varnishes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electric varnish in 1977.
70,000 metal men were involved in the strike of metalmen.
The strike was suspended by the Conciliation Board’s proposal for seven weeks.
Metal workers received a 16% raise.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused power losses around the country.
In 1993, it was a mess.
On 4 November 1993, around 20,000 people, many of whom were made unemployed, met in favour of the Parliamentary House to show their opinion on behalf of the work.
Firemen lived three months in 1998
The firemen's strike was one of the longest in the 1990s unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
In 1994, police went to the chicken port in the protests of farmers against the EU.
"Siberia is teaching, the EU will stop," was one of the hit words.
Espa's farmers had tons of snow.
In 1999, the Helsinki European Summit also made farmers protest and burn hay boats before the meeting place.
The nurses lived in 1983 and 1995.
For about a month, nurses lived in prison in 1995.
For the last time, they had been in strike in 1983.
The 1995 strike was colored by some deaths during the strike.
He threatened the strike and the carers' mass relocations in 2007.
In the end, the negotiations on the threat of mass demarcation had speeded up the outcome.
Doctors were limping in 2001
"Doctors in strike - escape," was part of the strike of leaching doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospitals lasted for five months and resulted in a lively debate on how strike can jeopardise patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised medical fees.
Students on the move in 2013
Some 5,000 students march for study support in Helsinki from the Senate to the Parliamentary Hall in 2013.
Central criminal police will find out the backgrounds of the Finno-French, full of refugees, to the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have requested help from the Central Criminal Police to find out the backgrounds of a refugee record registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped the border of Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck might have been on its way to Finland.
They were all in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility are at the scene in Austria, says Superintendent Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by truck to Austria became more fatal.
Of course, at that time, all 71 passengers on board died with suffocation.
According to General Radio, which first told us about cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish company.
The company conducts restaurant activities, among other things, and its managing director is a foreign-lawed man, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two of the Iranianism has been arrested for trafficking in human beings.
The refugee captain, the former drug criminal, and the dynasty businessman, the story of five smugglers.
The Uphoric king of smugglers, the violent boatman, the stylish missionary, and the taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, such people engage in trafficking in human beings into the European Union.
The criminalologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci at the University of Trento have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their clients, and their book Death Travel Office is published in Finnish this week.
In the book they present the hips of human trafficking, present solutions and present smugglers from different stairs of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
The light islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many of the Tunisians are heading for the summer trip.
On behalf of their location, the islands are also excellent for smuggling, as there are only 120 kilometres to travel to the island of Lampedusa, Italy.
Due to comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives in Emir, in the chain, the burning captain, and the father of six children.
The islands of light are famous for their shrimps, but it is more productive for the fishermen to carry people.
It has been done by Emir on its blue, ten-metre wooden water hundreds of times.
If the boat's full of feathers, it'll fit 40 people.
One trip, Emir, after the expenses, makes about 8 000 euros.
Emir has five assistants looking for her clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive in many countries, but during the Arab spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation was calmed down until the refugee crisis came again.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna island in small groups.
Emir's going to put them in empty houses for as long as he sees good.
Food is given in such a way that customers just and just stay alive.
The accommodation costs about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer leaves the money, it's their problem.
We're going to go to the water in the middle of the night with the lantern.
The first night is driven away from the islands, then stopped, waiting for the day and driving to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the seaport is hard, and passengers cry and throw up at 20 metres in heights.
At the most, human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants her to be scared.
That's why he beats his clients, and at least he says he's gonna beat the sounders to death.
He says in the book that once the police kept him occupied, he threw all his passengers across the street and ordered them to swim on the nearest island.
"I've made customers one by one from the neck and threw them across the line," says Emir in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of Sahara.
His countrymen are told he's gonna have to handle this.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
We need to show them who's in charge here.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran's a regular cab driver in Boovaš, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good. The starter engine's been rolling on its last one, and anyway, it's seen the best of its days.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi moves at all, moving towards the Hungarian border.
Boovaša is a 500 inhabitants' little village about 60 kilometers from Belgrade to lunch.
The centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mainly released.
In the forests surrounding the centre, without their families, men are staying in tents, camps, and abandoned cars, which now everyone has been able to find or build.
Families living in the forest who have not lodged an asylum application for Serbia for a reason or another.
Some people also stay in private homes, but it's a public secret.
Among the foresters, Gora finds most of her customers.
These are often stolen - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of cross-borders and weekly walks in difficult lands, often mountain areas and in the dark.
At the end of their arrival in the Boovasha region, in the center of the large trafficking of human beings, people are victims of death.
The Kyyts of Goran are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi, and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he'll tell you in the book.
"They say their business once, and that's enough," Gora says.
He says the Africans are trying to make a mess.
That's not what Goran likes.
Stupid fool all the way.
First, 300 euros will be agreed, for example, and then they will fall to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran stresses that he's a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he's doing a job cheaper than the rest of us and he's going to charge a ride to Hungary's border with only 50 euros per person.
It's a three-mile trip, most of the comfortably motorway.
I hear the colleagues are asking for a three or four-fold price.
Goran deserves about 50,000 euros a year.
It's not a lot of money for smuggler, but it's a very nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport migrants 12 km closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran does not care: he knows the ways and the roads, and takes his cyclists a mile away from the border.
Then he shows his customers the right direction and he's going to get rid of it.
The Work of Singing
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Missionary, and it's not just a nickname.
He truly has a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital city of Uganda, with many believers fleeing from Congo, and a small centre to help the Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Consignor runs from a smuggling business, where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He looks at the work of mercy.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and ensures that the rubber strip of white collars is stylized under the low waist of his jeans.
The host is proud of his new Mercedes, his mastro and his three motorcycles.
When the Ambassador does not preach, he will arrange people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
At first, the customer will call in one of the five telephone numbers of the sending company.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money from you and sail in the midst of the traffickers who cross the border.
In order to obtain the asylum seeker or refugee status, the authorities of Uganda must be told that they have come from, for example, the areas of war in northern Kiev, and that they have had to flee their homes to violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Consignor will arrange a new identity for the customer.
The old identity card will be destroyed and another one will be acquired.
It'll help us contact the Ambassador at Uganda Police Department.
After that, the customer will be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum procedures, NGOs, and finally the United Nations Refugee Organisation (UNHCR).
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He will charge each port separately: an application to Ugandan police will cost about EUR 100, a document to a humanitarian organisation of approximately 150, and a migration process, for example, EUR 4 500-7 000.
Folio and ice-creams
Tom's a beginner, a former drug criminal.
A four - year - old Irish on the coast of France at Calais, where his job is to load people into the trucks on his way to Britain.
He has an Afghan, a French taxi driver in London, and dozens of trucks who may not even know he is in a trafficking business.
At night, Tom and the cab driver picked up their clients, usually 2-3 people, one of Calais' centers.
They're driving A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would have to go straight to prison to arrange illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been sitting there for seven years because of drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs over the highway with his customers to the resting place where the drivers sleep before they continue across the canal to Britts.
Tom picks a suitable truck, he's gonna have to make sure it's on his way to England, not even Holland, and he's going to cut the safety net.
It's gotta be done quiet so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is on the line, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wrapped his client in an aluminium foil, similar to the one wrapped around the cooker or oven potatoes in the kitchen.
That should keep the police from spotting a hideout from the heat scanner.
Some use ice-filled sleeping bags for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place hoping he wasn't driving a bunch of midwives before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçuk is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
The Ukrainian Turkish population has been called a marketing master and an undisputed king of the Mediterranean countries, which manages sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, Küçuk has been operating and has continuously developed new forms of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage in relation to other entrepreneurs: he still wants the money.
One of the new methods is the luxury platform: Turkish ports are rented to take American or European families to a few days of tourist cruises.
In fact, ships will be loaded into a full range of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who will first be transported from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe.
Customers are stored in human stocks, for example in old industrial halls until they are ready to leave.
People are going to go to minibuss and drive somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it's given, we need to get on board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way under the deck.
The Navy can only observe how deep the ship swims, as no other signs of the human population are visible.
Food and drink is given, but the less passengers excavate and throw up, the better.
Küçuk receives approximately 53 000 euros from one luxury ship after the expenses.
He does not handle practical things himself, but hire captains, recruiters, guards, accommodationers and other smaller factors to do the work for himself.
During the summer period, transportation takes place at least hundreds and Küçuk earns millions.
He is thought to have purchased over a hundred apartments through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company, and an apartment he rents.
Muammer Küçuk was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the Turkish Democratic Party representative and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
After that, he's probably gone.

American Olympics reports their illness and becoming a prostitute in their book
Three times at the Olympics, the new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a racer of 1,500 metres, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton tells us in his book Fast Girl about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published a breakdown of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at Sydney Olympics.
He came to the contest in top condition and ran for the second best time in the race.
In the final, however, he was panicking.
At first, he rushed to the top and defended his leadership on a underground run.
At 150 meters before the paint, however, his powers were overthrown.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I made myself cross the line, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from a bi-directional disorder.
His brother Dan had been doing years before Sydney's race suicide, and he himself felt tremendous success pressure.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with strange men.
He also called on his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's cab was 450 euros an hour.
He tells me he's spent the money on a luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations of becoming a prostitute was that he needed the same adrenaline peaks as he had competed for public sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was ill with a bi-directional disorder.
The double life of the former Star Leader came out at the end of 2012, when the Smoked Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 meters away from the world's statistics during time 3.57,40, but remained the last of Sydney's Olympics.
The world champion was glad when the marriage put Norway's skis in control of the "Silver Back".
In the opinion of at least one of its colleagues, the Norwegian skiling lady Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of convenience.
The Northug and the Norwegian skiing union have failed throughout the summer and last autumn in the same way as the athlete's agreement.
Even though the Union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it is not suitable for a multi-time world champion and the Olympics.
The consequences of the dispute in the Norwegian skiing union decided to exclude Northug from the future period of the world.
The decision was given thanks to the double champion of the world, Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put the ski away.
"Thank you for showing your spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian skiing union and Northug is about money.
Northug would obviously like to be part of the season of the country team so that he could promote his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said that he was happy to represent an alliance that would also care for future generations, and that he would not let one athlete’s bowels.
At the same time, he pointed out that the Union has given Northug both economic and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug published his own notice on Tuesday, in which he assured himself he wanted to be brave in Norwegian colors next season in the World Cup as well as in the World Cup and the Olympics.
In total, Astrid Jacobsen won six MM medals, two gold medals.
He was involved last winter in Fallu in a team that won the news gold.
The shielding day of the pastors is also celebrated in the north
On the day of the race, 25.9. there will be paces in various restaurants and shops that have been given the shield of the pastors.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of food expertise and reduce the threshold for going to a restaurant and to raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants have focused on the capital region, but the high restaurants that are controlled and classified by an impartial operator can be found around Finland.
International attention to the event is shown by the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of turtle restaurants and organisations.
In the north, the day will be organized in Vasas in Fondis and Kantarelli.
In Kokkola, the turtle day takes part in the Old Town restaurant.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make an organisation one of the most important international events that will take place in the same day in a different world.
Finland will continue to be the host country of the event.
Kauhaki-lehti: Legal Chancellor applied for the establishment of a remote reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in the premises of LSK Business Park Oy, currently owned by Kauhava ex-Sauva.
According to the complaint, there is still a permanent nature of the critical infrastructure of the time of crisis in the region, which is used by the Defence Forces and its co-operators, i.e. the Finnish Eriklis netot Oy.
The Kauhakori-lehti reports that, according to a private person, the placement of a reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, defence forces may have interests in relation to the area and airport of the former Air War School, whose impact has not also been investigated when the reception centre was prepared, the paper writes.
The report states that for the last two years, negotiations have been held on the organisation of flight training and the results of any foreign operator to the airport.
The case has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (see).
A private person tells the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about the principle of opposition to the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned place in the former reserve area is wrong.
The remote city government discussed reception center issues last Monday.
Zone: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The administration means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented on journalists in the evening after meeting the presidents of all parliamentary parties in Mäntyniem.
According to the President, concerns about refugee governance were linked to all participants.
He values the ability of the Government and opposition parties in Finland to discuss confidentially fundamental issues.
Especially these days, when we face great challenges
The situation in Syria and the activities of Russia and the United States can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
It is desirable to have a dialogue on the development of the dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the continuing tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to the committee, the issue of NATO was also addressed in the discussions.
The president did not take a position on the situation in the labour market.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, beginners catch up for a few hours

From the Union's corner of Hakaniemi, transport is directed to the Union's street in the case of Kaisaniemi's traffic circle.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the number of people involved in the demonstration.
Only alarm vehicles shall be released to the area.
Metro and horse-hunts in the whole Friday's demonstration
Metro and tram drivers participate in Friday's demonstration of the morning traffic to the end of the night.
The Society of Raitio and Metro staff informed the STT about this evening.
The majority of Alkos closes for two hours, including posts closed
Friday’s demonstration also results in disturbances with Post’s services.
Significant delays are expected, among other things, for the distribution of daily mail.
Most of the postal service points are closed.
The blood transport of the Finnish Red Cross is maintained despite the strike.
Food transport as well as the dispatching of hospitals and laboratory samples are also being carried out.
Situational information on services can be found on Post's website.

The Employment Union of Services Pam has instructed its employees to stop work between 11:00 and 13.
Pam has also called on daily asset trading workers to participate in the demonstration of professional organisations.
SOK and Kesko’s representatives will tell the Helsinki Word that sales are being made to keep open, if necessary, the superiors.
According to Kesko, the possibility of closing individual stores is not yet known.
Helsingin part closed
The day care centres in Helsinki do not operate in full on Friday, inform the Helsinki Early Education Office.
Because of the interest of professional organisations, day-care may be concentrated in certain day-care centres, and day-care centres and play parks are not organised.
Full-time homes and groups of children with developmental disabilities and many disabled children remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of people with developmental disabilities and autistic schoolchildren will be organised normally.
The Office for Early Education is authorised to inform more about the changes in the operation tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipula takes a big risk
According to Sipil, communication requires a wide range of channels, and television and radio calls from the Prime Minister are one channel among others.
The channel for such a direct speech is also needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä said to journalists in the Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches become.
According to Sipilä, talks may not always be transmitted on Yle's channels.
If other channels report to channel, then let's see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipila said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires that TV and radio be given to citizens.
This dossier, which is now being debated, is quite complex and calls for a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipila figured it out.
The call will be sent at 21.05-21.20 both on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Areena.
I'm gonna take a big risk.
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's TV won't tell us about the more general government turning in.
Is it the intention to take a more stringent approach to defining the right of public debate and to refuse the public debate on the issues?
It reminds me of the recent comment by the Foreign Minister (Timo) that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define itself.
In the name of a democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters will not be linked.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is agitated by Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of policy-makers are not about communication issues in democracy.
The role of the Media representatives is, in a definition, to try not to take the agendas of politicians.
According to the hard work, TV is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, the Sipil should bring something new and special to the table so that the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech can be met.
Is there any more of what we've heard today?
Or can he speak in different words, in different ways, or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there are only more of the same old age in the promise, you must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it extraordinary time.
In this respect, everyone takes the risk in the sense that it is not a particular situation but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will become a message from politicians or Parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with the interest of Ylen or the general line.
A bright bet from the top
In the forthcoming speech, it is also important that what the Prime Minister does not say is emphasised by the media investigator.
Tonight, you must look closely at where Sipilä is missing and what you do not want, says Heikki Kuut, research coordinator at Jyväskylä University.
According to the six TVs, Sipil is a lively bet, because this is how it gets its own view out of the air without the sound of the rucksacks.
In this way, the message is made available to the public without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The Sipils pass the media and speak directly to the people.
However, the risk is that the media interprets something wrong, since specific questions are not available.
Six says it's very important how Sipila appears on TV, whether sweats or sweats.
He compares Sipila to his father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If Sipila can do her job well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to report on something, because here man is like speaking directly to another person.
Such (United States President Barack) Obama and partners are regularly engaged.
Very exceptional
Researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to be truly exceptional to the public.
He said that this has not happened in decades, that the Prime Minister will speak directly to the people.
Extraordinary time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The investigator believes that this is the way the Prime Minister wishes to make the Finns compassionate for the premises.
On Friday, employees' organisations are organising a demonstration and strike against government activities.
The President of the Left Association, Paavo Arhinmäki, says on Twitter that Sipilä could speak about the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, when the talk could also be discussed.
The Chairman of the SDP Antti Rinne (cf.) again announces his challenge for Sipilä's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
Almost six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
The 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere
He was fine at the moment he was found.
THE son's father updated his Facebook page.
The Home Finland police department will also confirm the matter to the East Side.
The boy went out to play out at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later tonight, he was never contacted.
My father thanks all the people who helped us find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
This update was distributed 15 000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
The UFC star in Finland was disappointed in the violence of young people: You will be hated at the moment.
Makwan Amirhani, a Kurditist freelancer, published a video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to young people who are immigrants.
Makwan Amirhani had to speak against the street fights of young people.
Amirhani, born in Iran and entering Finland at 5 years of age, has so far won both her professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirhani says he received a message asking for a Instagram account.
There are videos loaded on the account where young people fight with the most violent grips.
Amirhani tells me he's disappointed in the execution of youngsters.
26-year-old Amirhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick in the ground, sit on one side, and beat without thinking about any of these consequences, as you make these videos, Amirhani updates.
It's hard to defend.
Some of the young people on the video are immigrant.
According to Jarmo Heinonen, the Helsinki Police Commissioner, social media has been downloaded by both immigrants and young people from Finland.
It's the fact that you're fighting on the street at all.
You make life harder for many other immigrants here in Finland, Turkish Amirhani reminds you.
Amirhani reminds us that Finland has websites looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These isolated cases have become very severe.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you now.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be very long guests here.
That's a little different to thank you for being here, says Amirhani.
Amirhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they sometimes become the target of some racism, then you'll have to blame it on yourselves.
Now think about it a couple of times before you go in with one of those guys.
Amirhani says that violent activity makes a contribution to racism.
You're the kind of hate that I don't like.
You've got things pretty bad anyway, and that's not gonna make it any better, Amirhani.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter Lauri Lyly, Chairman of the SAK, says that on Monday, the employees' organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STKK.
Lauri Lyly commented on St.T.K.'s proposal on Twitter.
In the past Wednesday, the Staff Centre’s STK informed the Government of its proposal to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central).
The President-in-Office of the Programme, Mr Fjäder, believes that the Government will accept the proposal if SAK, STKK and the Plan are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest wager organisation, SAK, be softening its previous position.
Lauri Lyly, Chairman of the SAK, commented in a few words on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with this on Monday.
According to Lylyn, SAK is looking for solutions to open a labour market lock, and the status of forced law requires agreements concluded by active parties.
Lyly points out that the proposal by Prime Minister Sipilä's Government for a social agreement did not fit the SAK.
In the past, the Sipilä cut off the negotiations on a social agreement when SAK refused to commit itself to the objective of the 5% productivity cut.
Comment: A great demonstration threatens to sneeze - "It's a little silly to put a fist"
I mean, it feels a little silly to put a fist in the pocket if there's a piece of reconciliation paper in it, write Pekka Tiininen.
The feelings vary from one area to another in the wage camps.
Is it supposed to call the government to annul it, or will it be settled?
On Monday, SAK’s Federal Directors came forth with sacred hatred for the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to close.
And the Uto spread to the stimuli.
OAJ, a teacher's trade union, threatened to close schools and day-care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: none of the schools or day-care centres are completely closed.
In Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd) President of the Staff Centre for Staff, STK, appeared to be in agreement.
He told us that he had contacted the government and made a five-percent productivity cut required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.
Sture Fjäder (Cok) of the current President rushed to announce that his agreement paper was already ready.
At first, SAK's office didn't even belong to the yard.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the Federal Directors just ordered the country to stand on Friday.
Finally, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should tend to accept a 5 % productivity cut as a target.
No wonder Palolaan STK's relationship with the Sipila Government is fine.
The right hand of Palola, Head of the St.T.K. Social Impact, Jukka Eineus, former Minister of Central Affairs, Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi, served as special support.
Palola also described the improvement in the government's ay-skilling skills.
Sattuma or no, but Palola's exit took a little break from Finland's standers, whose image is the wedding of the ACP Marko Piitainen (sd).
I mean, I feel like it's a little silly to put a fist in the pocket if there's already some amicable paper in the pocket.
Modified at 18.00: Added information about Lylyn's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The Russian duumaan President, Sergei Naryshkin, criticises the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
Sergei Naryshkin, President of the Russian duuma, believes that Mongolia is better than Finland's father, Etyj.
In the capital city of Mongolia, Ulan Batori has begun the prosecution of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July festival meeting.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were forced from the European Union to attend the meeting - a matter of which the President reminded journalists of.
We believe that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin printed the news office according to Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was not only directed at Finland and the EU, but also to the United States, where his access had been prevented.
Sanctios are a political suicide from the EU, declared Naryshki.
The Russian delegation in Mongolia has become complex, so Naryshkin continued to covet Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for the 'special organisation'.
I am sure that the parliamentary general meeting will go hand in hand with positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva, a meeting in Ulan Bator, who has already discussed Russian delegation, according to the Russian media.
The lock meets the real playoff mirror: "Malile tight"
Tapara and Lockko are going to continue their bull days in Hakamets tonight, while both are on fire on the second day of the day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today's Hakamets will not see a real goal party.
The killer went to Kuopio last night to pick up a 3-2-long-time victory from KalPa.
The rise was a manly one, for the silver team of the last season was the worst of two goals.
The lock on Tuesday was much more molluscous.
As a guests of Blues, who started on the Iron Hall with a strong start, there were round zero points, and the loss readings were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, lockman Janne Lahti anticipated situations on the follow-up pages.
The killer has formed quite a playoff nightmare for the Raumas.
In fact, in the last two years, the tapara has just dropped in the spaces from the Locko finals series.
Both layers call for a decisive seventh match.
In the last season, the lock took the series to a break already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose on the next three sides and passed.
There are no major changes in the composition of the groups, except for goals.
Both of those who rejected us last night will be on a mission today.
With the kill paint Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhuse, and between the lock-tops Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Face: Up in the top, a terrible play is going on
The Sports Director, Loola, scripted head coach Rautkallio, inconvenient to the follow-up, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote Rocky's film, where he himself played the main part.
In sensually, the defendant put a heavyweight series on Apollo Creed.
Rocky got great sympathy even though eventually the title match was lost.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Tovaila's script was written in Pori by an unsatisfied ashtray.
An anonymous and wooden package of luggage advanced to all as a surprise to the SM standard 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underdogs like Rocky.
There were white Indians, Porin Matti and Pele Pelto.
In the drop-off games, the players dyed their heads red and cut the ironies.
It's called a blonde.
That's what JP Jalo called coach Neumann.
The ace took the winning silver.
It was one of the heroes.
The writer, Tovaila, believes that this season's novelty works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports leader of the mothers has built the potter on behalf of the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been rotting some shit in the faraway like Rocky's pig carcases at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparise are in some kind of a game other than a rock game.
The hope has forgotten that the main part of Rocky VI is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has been crucified to Sean Conners of Rautakallion.
Rautakallio is handicrafted in Rocky as a clumsy main performer as Connery would have been in the original work of 1976.
There's nothing in the iron ceiling but a favorite name for Rocky.
The game philosophy of Rautakallion is not part of the rushing and small-scale movement.
He appreciates a tough game, but there's a different thing to play hard as a pig.
In the last season, the Aässien Garrett Stafford had a stick on the head of the Tappara Jere Karjalainen.
He got two plus ten minutes from that chair, but Raitatallio put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We're the only ones who deserve to play.
I don't accept a game like that, and it's not part of an aceking, and after the game, Rautakallio's gone hot.
The team of this season is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, cops, colognes.
There are virtually no key players in the best game age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the art project.
How much have you been able to influence game acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the last period affect procurement and, unfortunately, the situation on the market was rather limited, Rautakallio responded diplomaticly.
Underneath the light.
In 1953, Rautakallio is clearly interested in becoming a sports bomb.
Men's contracts end in spring.
The top balance in the three leagues of the season has as many losses as the difference between goals 1 and 6.
I wish you hadn't written the rest of the script.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temone reveals that if he had met his husband when he was a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
For the first time, Olga Temonen plays under the guidance of his husband.
Yes, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, acting, and producer Olga Temone laughing.
He's been married to the Abilanna ex-Basisist and director Tuukka Temos since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but now Olga plays in the direction of Tuukka for the first time.
Olga's role in the early years of abilanta's story, you made us the most beautiful of us, is the drummer's mother, Sipe Santapuk, Sirkka.
Sirkka zemppa and support his son, even though his father Risto (to present Lorenzo Backmann) tries to be a sense of sound.
The more I have become acquainted with my true example of Sirkka, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me in the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that, the twin has been getting a lot closer.
They've met, they've been on the phone and they've been texting.
She's been helping so much.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
I am also glad to understand that drama is drama and the truth may need to be a little colored.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apatila would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, it was flat and really mean.
There was a pretty small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had a stroke, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot about Tuukka since she was young before she was planning a movie.
However, the parents’ stories have sometimes been slightly different.
Yeah, well, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you're up to.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from Heinola’s evil skater - known Tuuka.
Olga was a good girl who had nothing to do with the Tuukka movie.
At his highest, he could have been a secret charm.
Olga says he's been working so hard in ten years with Tuukka that a big joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always been a super-hot.
Now, the whole production group is going to go to Heinola for a month.
However, the couple living in ancient Israel often plan to drive home because of their little children, because the distance is not too long.
We're going to take over Henola for the whole month.
They have taken us very warmly, only to ask what streets and when to clear them.
Iron Sky 2 rose to Finland's most expensive play film
The Iron Sky, directed by Timo Vuorensola: The Coming Race film budget is EUR 17 million.
The photographs will begin in October in Belgium.
Timo Vuorensola begins filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The following part of Iron Sky’s scientific film, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will be the most expensive film of all time in Finland, with its budget of EUR 17 million.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been at Jalmar Helander Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation, which is under way, will also rise after completion of Iron Sky 2, as the film budget is over EUR 100 million.
Timo Vuorensola's film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, starts in October near Antwerp, near the AED Studios, and lasts for eight weeks.
Timo Vuorensola is going to Belgium next week.
The giant budget is not afraid.
I've been on a sick date!
I'm so relaxed about the file script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize that something is going on.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show you this movie to the audience, he'll tell the Night magazine.
Originally, 8-10 million had been envisaged for the film, but as the script developed, the budget was also increased.
The budget's big, but it's a big story too.
However, 100 million would be added to the film because each angle and efficiency are so expensive.
Now everything's so tight that there's nothing to find.
Today, the production company Iron Sky Universe launched a public finance campaign and a mass loan that is paid at an annual rate of 4-8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
After two years, the company will pay back the loan.
The film features Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
Big logos are coming back to the shirts.
The fronts of the Trends have recently been decorated with big logos.
Just a while ago, a fashionable dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocses in a concert.
The advertising of a hood or a t-shirt was seen as a bit of a jinx.
But times change.
Sport has become the true megatrendi of fashion, and so have the old, familiar sports fashion marks such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the cooly wave.
And as often as before, the border of the stench and trendy one is diabolical: if something is right, it starts to turn into iron and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. a tavis fashion, where trendsetters surprised us by promoting as boring basic clothing as possible, as if as a way to separate themselves from mass.
Now on top of the grey basic college, instead of the one that buried on the bottom of the cabinet, the front of which is the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, for example, Adidas identified track screens, favorite team gaming shirts and New York Yankees flags have returned to the street fashion.
At the beginning of the Farkks' edge, the primary calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
Trendi seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands too.
For example, the front of Versace’s sculptors makes clear what kind of clothing is.
Would you be willing to present logos in your dress?
The Russian politician published evidence: I did not get stuck in the tank too!
According to its claim, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, which held the Russian Arms Expo 2015 presentation of Russian war industry products.
Over the past few days, the Russian press has been saying that the Russian Emergency Department had to remove the large size of Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook page, which looks like he's snooping from the hatch of the armored vehicle in very good moods and, at least, on the basis of the images, it's nothing to be said or angry about.
Full of nonsense.
Let's start with not going into the battle armor truck, but it was a raiding tank wagon BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, serving at Ural.
I went in there, looked around, and I came out in peace, and Zotov said to Komosolskaya Pravda.
I wasn't stuck and I definitely didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
To the Russian army television channel, Zotov explained his desire for Russian technology in the exhibition because he was a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagons, and I was very interested in our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to every tank.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the raid wagons, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the author's stupidity.
One fool wrote and all the others repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm tall and ugly, but nothing that I'd be stuck in a tank, didn't happen, he said Russkaja sluzhba was not on the radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photo of the alleged chatter has been published, even though 50 000 people have been at the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov's wedding began in the first place on the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotov was told to crawl out of his tank trunk trying to kill everyone around, and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around, unless he gets out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the exhibition organisers explained their views on what happened.
Everyone's just used to the fact that soldiers jump out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, because of his large size, simply waited when he came out.
But he didn't sit there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Alexander Pisarevski Bloknot.

The Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland's Kittilä mine has had a leak.
The process water cleaned by the gold mine has been leaked from the so-called sand wave to its stream.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the bleeding.
In Alta, the foaming process is neutralized by enrichion sand and purified process water.
Usually, water is pumped into the environment either again as process water or according to the permit, through the surface-lighting field.
The bleeding rate was estimated to be approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of leak water meets the current permit conditions.
The rest of the material didn't fall into the environment.
The bleeding was observed during the inspection round on Monday morning.
The bleeding has not been observed to cause structural damage to the base of the vessel.
The company will report on its close cooperation with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuppämäki: IMF warns you not to cut too much
The country report published by the IMF today follows largely the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization has traveled to structural reforms covering Finland in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overemployment allowances and paid leave would help Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed in the whole contract system and in unemployment security.
According to the main economic operator of Danske Bank Pasi Kuppamäe, structural reforms are agreed, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a great deal of sympathy for government action, but on the other hand, there are words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
For example, infrastructure investments, Kuopamäki says to the Economic Area.
In the view of the IMF, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates an economic growth rate of 0.4% for Finland for this year, up to 0.9% next year.
In today's new economic forecast, Danske predicts that growth will remain on the arrow this year.
The IMF is slightly more optimistic this year.
They may have had the most recent findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was in a small increase this summer, says Kuoputamäki.
Less attention has been given to reduced confidence in industry or other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences concern only a few per cent of the decimal places.
Nintendo who recovers from death appointed a new leader
In July, under the influence of Satupu Iwata, who died of cancer, Ttsuma Kimishima began working on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo from 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face game industry.
Iwata, for example, responded successfully to Wii-konsol’s launch.
The 65-year-old Kimishima's choice is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, to assess Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima’s task is seen as being strongly involved in mobile games, but it does not eat bread on the part of the traditional game consoles of the company.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that even hundreds of children who have come to the country are missing annually.
Among other things, SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minors disappear each year.
Chief Inspector Juha Kannelmaa of the Finnish Immigration Service tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants disappear in a "land under" year?- A total of 156 minor asylum applications were made in Finland in 2013.
They lost 9.
In 2014, 196 applications were made and 11 of them disappeared.
The result of the disappearance may be that it is clear that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and that he may have been found to be a full age there.
In such cases, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue handling the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for handling the application.
Similarly, a part of the missing persons will be found later when they seek asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, Finland had a total of 3651 asylum seekers, of which 134 applications were decided to lapse because the applicant was likely to move away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared during the past 123 years, he says.
Is there an increase?
By 6.9 this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for minor asylums.
However, the number of minors who have disappeared this year is known and clearly increased, which is likely to affect the number of persons who have disappeared, he stresses.
What happens to those who take the decision on the conversion?
Will they, for example, be lost to the "migid labour market"?
It is difficult to assess this from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police responsible for the implementation of the return decisions, Kannelmaa stresses.
The Minister of Interior Petter Orpo has been concerned about the growing number of undocumented countries.
He has taken action on this matter.
At the EU's Internal Ministerial Meeting, the Orpo, on Monday, told about practical measures to manage asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of the devices
Timo T.A., who has lost his ability to work due to sickness, is now selling equipment for TV and radio production in Mikkosen.
Mikkosen’s spouse Nina Mikkonen sells Huuto.net devices that were once the most advanced professional tools in their field.
The first newspaper Iltamasin reported on the Internet announcement.
Today, much of the equipment has remained in the feet of technological development.
The digital media world no longer describes television programs for Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that you will find those interested in you.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but these are needed as long as there is an old generation of material that must be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of professionals - collectors and founders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is considering IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are trying to move away from their present House of Myrskylä.
There's no way we can take all the supplies with us.
I've begun to innovate and see where they're giving up.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkenen says.
There's no more use for television and radio equipment.
It's clear from a recent stroke that the man who made a long career won't come back to work.
Nina Mikkenen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. The actual life work of Mikkosen was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives visited the box shop to pick up movies and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic is more likely to be drilled than thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers will decide today whether they will expand their efforts in relation to Friday's demonstration of mind.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram transport only for Friday's demonstration of mind.
During the afternoon, it will resolve whether the traffic will stop all day.
Chief Agent Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is great on the ground.
Night and daytime cuts are a bad thing for drivers, so government plans for cutting the seats are agitated by opposition.
Hurvonen wonders, however, that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop by Friday, public transport in the capital area is practically almost completely stopped.
According to VR data, trains do not travel on Friday between dawn and evening.
On Friday, no local or remote traffic is moving.
Trains leaving before dawn shall be driven to destination.
According to HSL's data, most of the buses are going to be on a dead end.
ACP members are out of work on Friday morning at 3:00 p.m. on Saturday morning.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven, driven by the Chief Staff, the HSL informant, Pirko Repo, who considers them.
Repo says that HSL can't say exactly what bus transfers are going on Friday.
The employees' organisations are organising a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Agency on Friday at 11-13 p.m.
Aftonblad: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, says the news office AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled to panic.
According to the local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water pumps against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas, where the teacher thought it was a private watch for a bomb.
In Texas, 14 - year - old Ahmed Mohammed was arrested after the teacher held his school as a personal bomb.
Mohammed told Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to introduce himself to produce his electronic practice.
However, one of the teachers thought it was a bell that looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation finally ended with the boy being taken to a youth detention cell in the cuffs.
It was not said at any point that Mohammed claimed anything but that he had made the watch.
Still, there is still a possibility that the boy will be accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohammed, the cops said the watch looked like a movie bomb.
It's a police watch, but it was obviously made up of a circuit board and a digital display with leads.
The case happened last Monday, and Mohamedia was punished three days of forced school.
His father is furious about the case, and the American Islamic Council of the country wonders whether the case is another example of Islam in the United States.
The British director of Labour refused to sing a national song
In the song, God is asked to protect the queen, but Corby is the opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism put forward by the press of the right is accompanied by representatives of the Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This is an insult to the people, thinking that Kate Green's radio broadcaster at BBC's radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night's memorial ceremony respected the battle of British Air Force pilots against Germany's Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corby in its official opinion and stresses his respect for pilots by participating in the occasion.
We are all in a tremendous debt of gratitude for the heroism of royal airmen.
He (Corbyn) stood still with respect during the national song, stressed the opinion.
Corbyn's choice as a party leader has divided the lines of the Labour.
In particular, there are those among the referendums who fear that he will deport moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral armaments, the cessation of savings and the increase in public expenditure.
For the first time today, Corbyn is due to appear as a party leader in this Parliament at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby has asked the public for suggestions on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron picked Corby's choice as party leader on Twitter at the weekend.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our financial security and our families' security, your Prime Minister's sign in his own account.
The cause of the family death in Minnesota is still unclear - the father of the family was waiting for the case.
The South Lake Mintonica police have been investigating the family death in Minnesota Greenwood for a week.
The family of five was found dead in their home on September 10th and a few days later, the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
After his first shot with a shotgun, his wife and three children, Brian Short, killed themselves in the garage.
Dead days
The family was found after having been worried about the absence of children at school.
On the basis of this announcement, the police went to the house to visit the inspection visit and found a huge house on the other side of the Short family as dead.
StarTribune says it's possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A million houses and a successful company
The investigation of the case of South Lake Mintonka police chief Michael Sidar is still ongoing.
The motive for blood tests is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses on a directed social media site in AllNurses.com.
In 2014 StarTribune interview Short told us that there were four million different visitors per week on the site.
I've been offered 50 offers of the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned them all.
But I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, in 2011, when the Short Family bought a crazy house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised in Zillow as a car collector's dream: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also an adequate garage for eight cars.
Legal proceedings pending
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was waiting for the case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various pre-trial courses, had been sued by him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, there had been no comments about the pre-emptive courses removed from the Short Site, and therefore they had lost their customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on short-term transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffees
In addition, the owner's triangle was awarded at the food event at the Finnish horseowner's award for the month of Hippos.
This is great. Loiri commented on his honorary chart.
The party, Fabrice Duo, won Derby on Saturday and earned €100,000.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused by the success of Fabrice Duo at the grand competition.
I still don't think it's happening.
According to Lorir, success horse coach Korpi will have full employment while working with the horse.
Pekka will determine where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'm gonna shut my mouth, Loiri laughed.
The amazing gesture from the NHL star "The greatest talent of all time"
The Super Star of Montreal Canadiens, P. K. Subban, has donated $10 million (approximately €6.7 million) to the Montreal Children Hospital.
According to the medical report, the biggest athlete ever made a unique donation to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital in another fundraiser for the next seven years.
Subban and the Canadiens made eight-year-old and 72 million dollars a year ago.
So Subban's donation amount is significantly higher than his $9 million annual contribution.
In return for his donation, Subban gets his name from the hospital to carry the hall.
In the past, the Canadiens players have made significant contributions to local hospitals.
A year ago, the long-term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same child hospital, including the same child hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a giant amount of money for the other city’s grand hospital to receive the necessary PET scanner for cancer investigations.
The Japanese coffee can be ordered for a wife's evening, serve food with just bikinis and an Essu on her head.
The theme coffees are a tough thing in Japan.
The market already has a goat coffee, a cane coffee, a vampire coffee, a cheap coffee, and now a wife coffee.
It's hitting alone, on the associations, and on the hungry.
It's the Metro news.
You can order yourself for a wife or husband from Ore no Yome, my Finnish wife.
It's a waitress who pretends to be the client's mate.
"Poliso" is selected from the list before arriving at the cafe, and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is opposed to just an Essus and a bikini on her head, and her husband is in a tight ride.
The website provides a wife’s application for all information on length and weight to what type of pillow they prefer to sleep on.
As soon as 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: Attacks against vehicle security started to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in the sector, reports Intel’s release.
The Board is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
Researchers from ASRB will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB's findings.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting company, estimates that some 150 million vehicles are connected to the network by 2020.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75 per cent of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share online data.
We can and we need to improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Intel Security Director Chris Young.
With ASRB’s help, Intel can establish the best safety practices and support the view that cyber security is an important element in the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB Board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovations in data processing.

Fordin Focus RS has been expected for years as the moon rising.
Finally, the car begins to be on the horizon in Finland.
Ford released RS's data now that the car world's eyes are at the Frankfurt car show.
Ford's new four-wheel RS speeds up from 4,7 seconds to 100 and peak speeds over 266 kilometers per hour, thanks to its 2.3-litre, 350-hevo power engine.

The main brand Kia introduced two novels in Frankfurt's car exhibition - such as the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth generation Sportage, where Kia intends to catch a larger wing from the ever growing street market, will certainly be more important than two novelties in Finland.
The new Sportage created under Gregory Guillaume, the director of European design, is more circular.
There's been a cent in the middle of axel and outdoors, and the car's going to cut the air more effectively.
The engine range is essentially unchanged, but it has been increased by 177 horse power to develop 1.6-litre turbos.
More Kia Sportagest and its performance and consumption are reported as closer to sales revenue.
We still have to wait for it, because we have a new Sportage coming to us in spring 2016.
Even before the year changed, our new Kia Optimats made it to our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of the upper middle-class buyers with better driving features, lower noise levels and higher quality equipment.
The start is obtained with 1,7-litre turbo diesel and 2,0-litre petrol engines.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when Optima GT, equipped with a 2,0-litre turbo engine, comes alongside them.
During the same period of time, the sales of Optima farmer will begin.
Chisu's back on the stage. He's got a lot of balls on his back.
Singer Chisu is involved in the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
There's an open, open neck hole in the electric pants suit.
The house is a beautiful performance of the star of the singer's belt.
The whole thing is crowned with a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three - year break, a singer who became a mother - in - law has been punished with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to be a year old.
The singer published his first single in the new album in August.
After a long break, I'm not really excited about getting back to the stage and getting up to the public.
I've missed all the music-related work, the singer tells me.
Chisu will release a new album in a couple of weeks, while his fourth album is called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired you to do new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will think.
Kim Kardashian's masculinity is a little out of control, and now you see the chest.
True-tv beautiful Kim Kardashian gives the subject one after another.
He presents his pregnancy belt and chest equipment in unscrupulously sexy clothes, last night at one hour in America when he and his sister Kourtney Kardashian left the marriage of Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the breasts.
It reveals the colourful bras under the dress in the flash of lightning lights.
Last time Kardashian was wearing an amateur maternity dress when he visited his friend's dinner parties in New York just a few days ago.
The house was highlighted by black overcrowded boots.
The third special maternity uniform is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when it was a pregnancy day.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model of Manon Leloup wanted to take the impression that the model world would be a clean glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary Speaking Dolls (Speaking dolls) where Leloup and his colleagues speak their mouths of a clean model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered the six loud truth behind the scenes of Leloup.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if during the previous period you would have posted in top planners' homes, the new season will start again in Casting.
And every season will be new, fresh faces that will compete for work with the convents.
The models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take place for years in a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young, and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be insatiable.
New York and Paris are wanted jobs, but they are the most stressful.
It's not just one sort of weight.
Agent New York might ask for a drop of pounds, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
In fashion, models and designers are all together and act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks are over, the difference's gonna stink.
Models want this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but the fact is that everyone thinks the work is just displaying clothes.
The models too want to be their own person.
It makes them feel like they're actors with some kind of role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
The models you made last night at Tory Burch's show.
In New York, fashion weeks are being celebrated, where designers will reveal their collection next year.
Roope Salminen, who has changed her style, plays the most unknown autlanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen performs Antti Lautala in a film based on the early years of the Auslanta Association.
Lautala was founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtasen, but resigned from the association in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this film I'm playing 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughing.
I've never wanted to meet Antti before the illustrations because I want to make her my own interpretation.
The Antti is clearly unknown to people from that group, so I think it's good to learn only from the video.
I don't want to make an impression of a human being.
A man who trusts Roope Salminen and the Dogs Association is not going to play the role.
Punk-mangers come from the man according to nature.
The stars, stars and stars in the punk phase of the program will certainly have seen the first taste, as well as if you've ever seen our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but we always go full.
During the year 1993-2004 the bassist Tuukka Temose, directed by us, was released today.
The group, known to the band, is presented to the general public by quite unknown young actors.
Rummali Sipe Santapukkia performs Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a tip of his future plague last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he would prepare for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already released a picture of his new story on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to do for the film.
Roope, previously seen in the figs and jaws, has shaved his face to silo, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think in recent days about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees seeking to go to Europe.
Or is it worth telling me at all?
There is no need to speak out loud, a member of the SPR crisis team, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected, and, for example, they are not allowed to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can remain in the mind and distress, he says.
However, if the child has encountered or heard from refugees in TV news, it is worth talking about.
It is good to visit the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fear of a child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parents think he is afraid of.
You should not be afraid for nothing, even if you are anxious and afraid.
A smaller child closely follows the conduct of his parents.
If parents themselves remain calm during the debate, the child also experiences being safe.
Larger children are likely to run into discussion with refugees at school, with friends or on the Internet.
It is good for parents to talk to them about it if they are to think about it.
The fact is that not all people in the world are well.
Together with the children, parents can reflect on how this is seen in our family.
But in the end, do we think that the world is a safe or safe place?
Parents may also have different educational aspects - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child gets a model on how to deal with the challenges facing life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social Psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Study your children to help the weaker"
End your own powers?
Still, you can be a good parent to your child.
It is difficult to control the Pallosalamaa that hit the blood.
Perttu Pohjola got a sweat on the Apilan Pallosalama in the middle of the attack.
It swept only profits and seconds until, at the end of July, a collapse occurred in Tampere's raves.
Since the slave was abandoned by the bottom, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a time to protect his protective device from a veterinarian.
The explanation for how it went out was clear in the seal.
The horse had an infection in the throat.
The disease wasn't the easy way to get out of it, but it took two meds to figure it out.
Since Apilan Pallosalama had to be in light motion, Northjola says that he was positive about the last race of the horse.
It was the second SE station after Taruntuvuu.
Apilan Pallosalama was under severe pressure when it could have been driven normally for just a few weeks.
At the end of these points, the small bend was understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a good race made steel for the Ori.
The sentence of the horse must have moved on from it, and I hope that it would also have become even.
Apilan Pallosalama has been called humor horses.
When you haven't had any fun, you could have thrown it fat without your disease.
On the good day, however, the Ori has been cut off by such a sham that the opponents have been wonderful.
At high speed, turtles can't cope with Pallosalamaa, where even warm-blooded rides can't get off.
There's a baseball drink in Vermo.
However, the difference is how Apilan Pallosalama agrees.
It's kind of hard at the moment of departure, and it might be a little bit difficult to get out of here, and it's a lot like that.
I hope the slave would be more calm than Turku's leaving.
When Apilan Pallosalama is well, we can also come out of the bow, and we are going to drive it out of victory, coach permission.
That's why you can't get rid of your dirty iPhone software.
Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programmes that come with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future, but not all of them.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own apps from iPhone phones in the future, reports Tim Cook Buzzfeed's interview.
Apple's iPhone has a series of programs that are relatively rare to use: for example FaceTime calls, magazinekioski, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Vinkik come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as an forced update to iPhone phones, even though it is only necessary for Apple’s smart watch owners.
Cook says that removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which iPhone applications in Apple work closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple's looking into it because the company doesn't want to waste any memory space on the iPhone phones of users.
inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, i.e. 0.1 per cent of the year-on-year, Eurostat told us today by the EU Statistical Authority.
The rise in prices led to a downward decline in energy.
In this way, from a few weeks ago, Eurostat revised its preliminary estimate of 0.2% slightly downwards.
In July, inflation was 0.2%.
So-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's preliminary estimate for base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy was 7.2 per cent lower in the euro area last month than one year ago.
In the whole of the 28 countries, average inflation in the EU was in zero in August.
In July the rise was 0.1 per cent.
In August, consumers' prices rose most from the euro countries, i.e. by 1.4 per cent.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU's harmonised price index.
In the euro area, inflation continues to be far from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB) which is an increase of 2% in the medium term.
On average, the ECB predicts inflation of 0.1% for the euro area for this year.
Next year, the increase will rise to 1.1%, and the new inflation forecasts it published at the beginning of September will be projected by the central bank.
The US Fed is going to try and tighten up monetary policy next.
The US's next fall will start at its fastest in less than one year, but more definitely within three years after the country's central bank Fed takes up its interest rates again for a long time.
And the bottom line in the financial market begins before the next fall.
Fed has suggested that he will start raising interest, possibly by this week and by the end of the year.
Thus, the next fall can be hit as fast as possible by the autumn and the financial market course before that.
Or at least this happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets function as they used to be, and if they react to Fed's money acquisitions as they have done before.
Such conclusions have led to the strategies of the German bank Deutsche Bank's London market investigation, Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive long-term market and economic cycle investigation.
The bank distributed the Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its international clients last week.
The strategies developed by the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will start to raise interest rates or what will happen in the economy and in the market afterwards.
Instead, they present, by means of the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, how the economy and the market have previously behaved at and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they will consider what key economic and financial market variables are now in the same or another model as at previous interest rates - and what they might be following.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more horrific position to withstand interest increases than once before in the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession may not be a year.
The leaders who decided on Fed's monetary policy and its subsequent initiation have long since mentioned last summer and the early autumn that the time began to be ripe to raise interest rates.
The first highlight for more than nine years can come this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on this matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised his so-called Fed funds control rate in June 2006.
At that time, for a relatively regular period of two years, it ended with a series of small 0.25 percentage points, at a time when Fed raised its interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%.
The financial market symptom began in 2007 with the most risky housing financing difficulties in the United States, and one year later, the financial crisis broke down as a global nightmare for the day of judgment.
The great recession took place in 2009.
Last time the financial markets and the real economy started to go slower than the previous Fed interest rates have typically happened.
Correspondingly, the trials were harder and more difficult than once in the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have covered the rises and declines of the world's largest economies, as well as the turnings of the financial markets since 1950 and in place from the beginning of the 1800s.
From the 1950's onwards, the Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial implications will be made clear.
The initial interest rate has taken less than one year, most often less than three years and on average less than three and a half years since the start of the recession.
The increase in the financial market has ended within one year and two from the start of Fed's interest rates.
Fed's shifted up and downed his steering rate after the early 1950s by a dozen different cycles.
Each time has been different from others in some respects, and the review is relatively limited, so it is unlikely that there will be any conclusion on the impact of the following interest rates.
The strategies remind me that this time there are many things that are different.
Not just better.
Interest too long
Because of the crucial causes of the financial crisis, we may not find out without doubt even through decades of research.
However, three aspects of the crisis's leadership and its destruction, I think, are somewhat undisputed:
1) Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other major central banks of the world, in the 21st century, considered their steering interest to be too long too low.
They patched up the technokupus, and they also raised the next one.
2) Over the decades, the number of debt accumulated in different parts of the financial and real economy increased even more from the monetary policy effect of the central banks.
The largest debt bubble in economic history was born up to that time.
3) In particular, crazy debt financing, which was the most liquidised in the financial economy, was the biggest exchange of shares in real estate, bonds and commodities in most parts of the financial market so far.
However, it is unlikely that the financial markets that had risen to levels in the face of the ever more complex debt shortages were in the rare dangerous and unstable situation when Fed and the other central banks last drove up interest rates.
As a result of the debt structure, the valuation coupons could not last as long as they had started to raise interest rates and the cost of debt financing had gone up.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis and resulted in a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategies do not guess what will happen next, but give the nuclear issue by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now held their monetary policy even more lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) The debt has not been bad for a long time as it has been ten years ago, but now the debt money is literally cheaper than the expression.
Consequently, the debt burden on the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now, in various parts of the economy, debt is much more severe than before or before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity issued by central banks in a deeper and cheaper manner has largely remained on the financial market and the main types of securities and assets have been reduced to the top or ever prior to the financial crisis.
And not only are the strategies of the lattice of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not recovered from the financial crisis and from the tens of years to the worst to the model that has happened before.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but in a similar way the pressures and risks of the financial markets are far greater than before the financial crisis, when Fed is going to press ahead to tighten up his funds.
Perhaps the picture of Albert Edwards' future of the French bank Socite General's strategy is not as strange as it may suddenly seem.
He's been training the bank's international investor clients for the following full translations of Fed:
First, Fed raise interest rates, then the financial coins break out, and soon, it's time for Fed to cut off the financial cuts with even bigger QE cash cuts.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) manufacturing computers and outputs will reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed at HP’s business service party, the company says.
HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprises and HP Inc., focused on consumer pc machines and outputs in November.
HP had the highest number of employees in 2011, with 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records the non-reflecting costs of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce 25000-30000 employees.
Reductions by the consumer will remain at 3300 in three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries, with 60% of its employees in low cost countries in 2018.
The company tells us that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers will account for more than 10 percent of its operating result.
In the second year, its three main customers accounted for 65% of the operating profit.
iOS 9: How to get a new operating system after the update of iPhone Apple
A new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, by clicking the "General" and then by selecting "Promotion Update".
If the update is ready, the phone will give you an option to download and then install it.
Some have had problems after this installation, when an error report has appeared on the screen.
To override this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst crash to pass or try to update through iTunes.
The phone will guide the user in the final process.
This may include removing applications to achieve the status, but Apple has reduced this option by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process by a new tool that proposes to delete applications and then reinstall them when the update is completed.
You should make sure that your phone has been loaded or the charger is close to your computer during the update that the battery will not be in the end.
If the level of download is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, as if the battery is out of order, it may result in a breach of the update.

Yle: Minister Berner has worked for the government of a tax haven company
According to Ylen, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the board of tax haven companies.
According to above, so-called tax planning was linked to the company's activities.
It is a Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo company appointed as a board member, Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board.
Berner himself says he left a notice of resignation in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough that I've left a notice of separation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on an agreed timetable, says Yle in an interview.
Membership after merger
The Luxembourg company manages the ownership of the Swedish Kährs.
Kährs is a flooring manufacturer, who evaporated with the Finnish parking manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner worked for the Karelia-Upoflor Government in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs, as well as in Luxemburg.
According to above, Kährs’ ownership in Luxembourg is passed through a multi-ported ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted the membership of the government at Kährs' second largest owner's request.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the Karelia Upoflor government owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was contacted to find a partner in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to ensure that the interests of the Finnish family company’s capital were achieved.
It is important that we ensure that the income of the capital of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this connection, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership of the company does not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up for tax havens is due to the fact that Triton, the largest owner of Kährs, had already prepared a Luxemburg holding company for ownership.
Espoo opens the reception centre run by the company
Espoo Otaniemi opens the first reception centre provided by the company for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from today's evening.
The number of seats can be increased within one week by up to 300-400 persons.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue Centre.
The activities are maintained by Luuna Oy, which is primarily responsible for the production of health care and medical care services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Service and Luuna Oy agree together, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STK prepares an alternative work-life blackmail package
STK will start preparing an alternative package for the tensions in the government's working life.
The organization also hopes that other employees' central organisations will be involved.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being paid in Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing the cost of work will then be restored.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola pointed out at a break in the organisation’s administration meeting to journalists.
Palola estimates that the Central Association of Business Life (EC) is not ready for discussions.
The economists of STK have calculated that the change security contained in the Government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if it's a part of a terrible enthusiasm to have a conversation if it's one-sided relationship with a hundred people.
Palola: Reconciliation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has called for alternative proposals by Wednesday, since then the government will be required to present a communication on its own package to the Parliament and to begin the preparation of reforms.
Palola did not take the view that the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a link between the government and it has been always constructive about him.
According to Palola, the staff's central organization on the field of STKK, especially Sunday's surgery is a painful place.
The organisation requires the government to back up the forceful legislation to implement part of the blackmail.
According to the St.T.K., Palola does not say that an alternative package would be prepared with SDP.
The employees meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the work-life blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the remuneration of the first days of sickness is cut, the overemployment benefits are reduced, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays reduced.
The STK stresses that central organisations have called on employees to express their minds, and that the aim has not been to set up a strike.
The Fjäder in the scheme says he's in love with you.
Mr Fjäder, President-in-Office of the Plan, congratulates the STK's statement on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STK is now on the same lines as Akka, since there are options for government presentations in Akas.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in an alternative package, because without SAK the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
Mr Fjäder, President-in-Office of the Programme, hopes that the SAK led by Lauri Lyly will prepare the proposal as an option for surgery.
Antti Palolaan STK earlier said that it would prepare new proposals on Wednesday.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the plan announced that it had long prepared its own presentation, which is ready to negotiate a five-percent competitiveness gap with the government of the country as an alternative to cuts.
The plan has been ready to negotiate all the time, and we have long written an alternative model for government presentations.
We are prepared to look at the terms of the service relationship as part of the agreement.
In response, we want security of change and working time banks," says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Akán lines, as STK had done before Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
The draft Bureau will meet at 15 a.m. on Thursday to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the common coal, the winters" - play bingo in Sipilä's talk tonight
Green Left of the University of Tampere
Viva bingokuponki, Green Left of the University of Tampere.
Presidencies have previously held special speeches during the rebellion and wars in Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on the Ylen channels on Wednesday at 21.05 p.m.
In order to seek the corresponding Prime Minister's previous speech, it is necessary to go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he held a famous radio call, which meant the beginning of the rebellion in Mäntsälä.
After that, the President and ministers held several radio calls during the winter and after war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held, instead of President Mauno Koivisto, a New Year's speech, but it was more of a ceremony.
In autumn 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended up on TV with a train protector strike.
Single phone, monarchist meins
The talk has raised criticisms and guesses of what I'm about to do.
The President of the Left Association, Paavo Arhinmäki, stated on Twitter that "The Sipilä could speak of the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, when the talk could also be discussed".
According to the Greens Ville Niinistö, "one phone has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
In Facebook, the Erkki Judgment of the SDP condemned that "monarchist melinks: the Prime Minister will tell the people what is best for it".
The president of the SDP, Antti Rinne, appealed to the Sipilä dialogue: "I have spent six months in elections.
It's not the only thing to do with the Prime Minister on the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What is the fear of @juhasipila?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and will take about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it is commented on the direct broadcast by Mr Lauri Lyly, President of the SAK, and Mr Jyri Hähkämér, CEO of the EC.
I've been criticised for presenting Sipila's speech.
We would consider it and we said that it is a public service task to promote the comprehensive public administration of Finland, a line from Ylen's Director, Ismo Silvo Yle.
It's like we at Tammelian's time.
The speech has also raised loose ends.
The dinner that came evening will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be covered and dressed as their best.
Mom's gonna put on the nicest monster, and Dad's gonna make a tie on his neck.
At nine o'clock, we'll be slowing down to television before we were back in Tammelian', by blogger Saku Timonen.
"Do Prime Minister Sipila also ask why, in his speech, there are millionaires in the Finnish government who hide their capitals, who draw up laws of mercy for their fellow taxpayers and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut off when the state is over?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left of the University of Tampere, Viva.
It's published on Facebook with the bingon next to it.
Can we hear about the same boat, the common coal, the living in debt and the team man tonight?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21.05 p.m., it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal for the exclusion of al-Assad
Over three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer by which President Bashar al-Assad of Syria could have given up power, tells President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian UN Ambassador proposed a plan for al-Assad to disappear in style after some time.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian Ambassador, Vitali Tshurkin, in a bilateral debate, listed three points of the plan: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and the abandonment of al-Assad had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we are able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I did there and he said sit down, Alas, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari will remember the Guardian interview.
Diplomats don't comment
The Ahtisaari tells us that Tshurkin's message was transmitted to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate to the press, but Ahtisaari says there are no two words.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on the arguments made by Ahtisaari, but they said that, at that time, Al-Assad's troops had already committed several massacres and the main opposition groups refused all the agreements that he would have been in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, views the words of Ahtisaari, as according to his experience, Russia was not at any time prepared to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
I was in the middle of saying that Tshurkin spoke with the Moscow council.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speech, I would have answered that I wanted to hear the same President, Vladimir Putin, so I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, in that case, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's hip to hold power with some of Al-Assad's supporters.
The refugee power to do our own work
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
Over 11 million people have had to escape their homes for war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The escape from Europe is what we have done.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying for the invoice that we yourself caused, says Ahtisaari to the paper.
Agency for Asylum Applicants with a heavy load on the Tower
The asylum seekers’ organisation centre designed by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be set up in Turin.
The Centre would be set up in the tower building in the city center empty.
The Ministry of Interior has sought a place suitable for the need for better management of refugee flows from the Swedish border.
Helsingin's messages announced on Tuesday that the council would have already decided to present a school building as a state solution to the Ministry.
According to the Vice-President of the Tower City Council, it is not true.
When the whole council was not assembled and some of the people wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council to decide on this matter next Monday, he would specify it to the STT.
There were 36 delegates from 43 at the meeting.
13 delegates were opposed to the organisation centre.
On that basis, you could expect the decision to be positive, Mr. Good says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city received contact on Monday, and it was reacted quickly.
The Joint Society could be estimated to have 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has been asked to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is about a hundred feet from the border, so that would work in that sense, says Nousianinen.
Sipilä still hopes for an alternative to the labour market for blackmail
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) only a part of the government's efforts to calculate the cost of work would be carried out by the public holiday money.
However, the government is happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners are able to agree on such an option.
Sipilä told the journalists in Parliament that she had not been in contact with the social partners.
Nor did he know how seriously the organizations are looking for substitute tools for the tensions of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the whole package.
In Sipilä’s view, taking the money off would be a way of dealing with almost all employees in the same way as, for example, a Sunday surgery proposed by the government.
Labour market organisations could agree on the operation of holiday money because they have been recorded instead of law in collective agreements.
On this occasion, the government will report to the Parliament next Wednesday on the tensions of working life as announced by the Government.
It is true that the proposals made by organisations should be known before.
This isn't the end of the line.
The legislative work will then start to move, i.e. the train will be on the move and will be more difficult all the time.
It's a very long time.
It won't take long in such matters, if there is a will, Sipila formed.
The government's publication last week has, among other things, a modification of the stolen and helatorista into unpaid leisure days without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the remuneration of the first days of sickness is cut, the overemployment benefits are split, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays reduced.
The reforms are being implemented as a forceful piece of legislation over trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
In view of the activities carried out by employees' central organisations, on Friday large-scale demonstrations have been organised, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
The Dwarf Council approved the extension of the juice room warehouse
The council of the Gulf approved unanimously, but a little bit of the extension of the warehouse of Nordic Koivu Oy’s hall of juice.
The criticism was that the project was bigger and more expensive than originally discussed.
It's also a busy schedule.
It was also slightly wondered that the need to order was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the extension of the stock at 400-450 sqm was approved as an investment programme, but the funds will be decided at the time of the interim report.
Another item on the agenda was the investment of €150,000 to €200 000, but the technical director Erkki Iconen said that the price is estimated to be €300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis that it would bring employment and tax revenues to the municipality.
The municipality does not have a risk as the company pays the investment as a rental, Vesa Väistö (see).
Even in the Karelian language, the place in Joensuu
The city government suppled its previous strong position on bringing farm - speaking street name signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important, and it is right to maintain the livestock tradition throughout the country.
Joensuu does not declare itself a capital city in the language of the herd, because there is no historical basis for it and the language of the herd is not an inherent part of the identity of the area.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastern savolainen fractures.
After a new decision, there will be no street name signs in the town centre.
However, on a case-by-case basis, the city of Joensuu is also ready to use the language of the herd, for example, in the information tables and in the marketing of tourism.
The same view of the city favours all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single-lingual municipality, it is also worth taking a generous approach to the use of the livestock language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in Northern Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still specific in the country, as is the image of Joensuu as a whole forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be used to benefit from a wide range of markets in the region.
The derailment of train connections reduces the vitality of the county
Circumventions of train connections hit the county with a strong hand on its vitals.
Transport links directly affect the economic life and competitiveness of the county.
And it seems to be possible to live and work here at all, the Mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also highlights air transport, which has also been on several occasions in the report.
From the point of view of the whole region, it is important that we do not manage to reduce the scope of government measures, as is now taking place.
The impact of the termination of these transport connections on employment, for example, should be seen in the Karjainen's emphasis.
The deterioration of transport links poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here are, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, the headmaster of the University of Eastern Finland Jukka Mönkkönen says.
He points out that poor transport connections also affect a researcher community that is very mobile and travels much because of research.
The recruitment director, Marko Junkkarinen, says that it is already difficult to market a university in the West Finland because the links are weak in a cross-border direction.
At the moment, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
On the other hand, about 10-20 per cent is from New Zealand, which is partly explained by direct rail connection.
Joensuu became one of my lines for Siu's war
The view of the City Government of Joensuu on the regional Siu sote project is apparently unanimous, but there is one among my ring voices.
Ms Pentti centralsalo (cf., in the picture) presented the government at a meeting on Monday about abandonment of the whole project, but his presentation was unprofitable.
The Government approved the proposal for a decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give a final statement of the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train trip from Kotka to Kouvolaa ends next year
The transport of passenger trains from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, even less than one train shift.
There will be changes in passenger trains between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train crew is left out, but still five more days will get from Kouvola to Kotka and vice versa.
The reduction is due to State savings measures.
The purchase of rail transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely terminated.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They enter into force on 27.3.2016.
The boys climbed up on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped out.
The rescue facility let a 12-year-old climbed out of a climber on the roof, who couldn't help himself down the roof.
The situation was born in Turin on Ketotie at six o'clock on Tuesday night.
There's an old double-storey wooden house in the area that doesn't have any ladders on the roof.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb down the roof of the house along the mass of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
The result was that the others swept from the place and the passers alarmed the rescue facility to assist with the bets of the last roof safely returned to the surface of the earth.
FedEx’s operating profit doubles, calculates the tax year’s outlook
FedEx reported the depressive results in the last quarter, and the supply waste cut its performance forecast throughout the year, as a result of reduced demand for freight services and higher costs for its ground services.
The company also said that it was going to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
This time last year FedEx announced that it was hiring 50 000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Its share fell by about 2.5 per cent at the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening clock of the Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. says it looks forward to the end of the tax year next May to $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts waited for $10.84, let's say in the Facts survey.
The smaller outlooks were, on average, 4,9 % of the price increases, which entered into force on 4 January, and despite the higher additional charges that started in November in the transport of heavy or large packages.
The company said that it would expect operating profit to grow from the year before, because they have cut costs, sales have increased and online sales are growing.
The president and CEO, Fred Smith, said that the company "is stable in view of the weaker economic conditions expected, especially in production and worldwide trade."
The plans for wages during vacation were published on the day after the competitor UPS told us that he was going to hire 90-95 000 extra workers, about the same amount as he hired last year.
In the fourth quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx’s result was $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The winning per share came to $2.42, which is left in the average forecast of $2.44.
Net sales rose by 5% to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks' questionnaire, six analysts were expecting $1.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years the decline in international priority transport, which has stopped the development of its Express unit’s turnover.
However, the increase in the online trade has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the net sales of the unit increased by 29 per cent, but in principle the revenues of the operations were the same because of the cost of larger packages and the cost of own insurance.
The income of the Express unit was better due to higher basic charges, whereas higher labour costs were lower in the freight sector.
At the opening auction about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx’s shares fell to $3,85, or 2.5 per cent to $150,15.
FedEx closed 11 per cent on Tuesday for this year and 17 per cent less than 11 per cent for June.
This week, the heads of the U.S. Central Bank will be sitting around a huge table for two days at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the steering rate for the first time for almost a decade.
On the second step from the central bank's decorative, double-storey meeting room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation ahead of everything else.
The Congress has reduced the dual liability of the central bank: they must maximise US employment and keep prices stable.
However, since the large recession, central bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This third requirement can be a decisive factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so tight that it cannot be predicted, and the decision whether the US economy is ready to be re-elected on a record of the incentive that has brought to zero the short-term interest rate remaining close to last year .
Although most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, the recent collapse in the global financial markets can have made the central bank's officials in advance more sturdy, which will be to increase instability, and how would it affect if the federal foundations were to raise the reference value even in the quarter of the percentage point.
"In particular, labour market and inflation are the first and most important elements to be followed," says Lindsey M. Piegza, the Mellárriike Stife Nicolas & Co's main economic expert.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for justification for a return to interest rates, there is an increased uncertainty on the world market that is still valid enough," he says.
The decision of the central bank has not been reached by consensus, which already gives rise to nervousness in the economy.
According to Bloomberg's recent study, about half of economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
Again, the financial markets expect the central bank to delay the increase, as, according to the key indicator, there is only about 30% potential for growth.
This refers to the decline in securities markets if the central bank rises the level if the decision-makers then manage to soften the impact by promising that the next increase will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose 228.89 points, i.e. 1.4 per cent, with a new figure of 16 599.85.
The recovery brought with it the expectation that the central bank would keep the level unchanged this week, says Mr. John Lonski, Chief Economic Expert at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank raise interest rates right now," he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, "they need to see much trouble in line to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argue that an increased level would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty as to when the central bank will operate.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter point this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation, which would confirm the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has said in spring and early spring that she is expecting the level to rise this year, despite the fact that the Liberals in their complaints require more economic development.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, the growth in the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest of seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the limit of full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of tightening.
Although inflation remains below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the central bank's decision-makers believe that there is a significant temporary effect on the price of the oil that has fallen.
The economy "more clearly on interest rates and also needs to be taken into account in the strict situation on the labour market", says Ian Shepherdson, Senior Economic Expert at the Pantheon Macroecnomics.
However, the financial markets around the world were shocked last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index fell by up to 16 per cent from its May record when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would also slow down global growth.
The markets have recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow Index now stands at almost 10% below the peak reading in May.
For the decision-makers of the central bank, market millerrys is an additional factor in a complex equation, which tells us that the interest rate should be increased.
"If these events on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy last week, the decision-makers would tighten up levels at this meeting," says Stephen D. Olier, Special Researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Central Bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers will wait at least one month to gain a better understanding of the effects.
"The possible effects on the US economy are still quite unclear, and they do not have much information on the consequences of Chinese events," says Olier.
The welfare of the international economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so it should in principle not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
In 2013, the president, Ben S. Bernanken, suggested that the central bank could "severe" the amount of money, caused the world-wide upheavals.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly concentrated, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The decision-making process of the central bank is "more art than science", says Zachary Karabel, Head of the Global Strategy for Property Management Company Envesnet Inc.
The President of the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Reserve Bank) of the State of Virginia, Jeffrey Lander, pointed out this month that "the central bank has previously over-reacted its financial market business, which has affected itself to be separate from the basic economic factors".
The Federal Open Market Committee, which takes decisions, has called for interest to be raised, and Mr Lander, a member of the Committee entitled to vote, calls for an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
The economic crisis in Asia caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings "in spite of its limited, identifiable effects on US economic growth", says Lacker.
A year later, the central bank reversed these cuts.
The central bank should give priority to economic stability only during the major crisis, as the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest-setting committee.
The last millerrys aren't even close to that level, says Posen.
"No one wants a situation in which the interest rate rise is feared because the market is depraved," says Mr Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Law on the Central Bank (Federal Reserve Act) still holds a dual requirement and does not mention financial stability as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.
You miss a great Thai store?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
This store/stock was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
The LAX-C, which is often referred to as Thai-Costcona, is a bulk store that sells to private individuals.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The store/stock is one stop shop that offers a stunning selection of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen needs, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car section in the shop if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes more than an hour to go around all the corridors.
If you get hungry, you can eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The menu inside the store (good, cheap) is close to the cats, and there are several pick-up options.
What do you find in the warehouse: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C is probably selling it.
Products have been priced rationally and a large part of the products are sold in wholesale packages.
New products have Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruits and other products.
The meat counter is wide, the same fish counter, and the staff is cleaning the fish and fill the fish and, if necessary, if you want to bloat it for you.
A large part of the store is reserved for a huge freezer department, where you can find frozen curry leaves, furskins and gallans, whole ducks, fish, beef meat and balconies, carrots, fish bulls, local sausages, meals and more.
Who goes to the store: Restaurant owners and cooks, but also individual families and individuals.
It's good for people who use the music. It's good for shopping. It's good for people who use the music.
Finding: Fresh month's duriot next to the cash register.
Where it is located: The store is located in the Los Angeles factory district near Chinatown and downtown areas - a few blocks from Philippe The Original List.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, which it distributes with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store can be busy, the parking lot is usually easy.
Rio Grande, the Brazilian Children's Disease Organization, promotes healthy diets for mammals
The Brazilian Children’s Disease Organisation SPRS has developed a shocking way of trying to make women understand the importance of good food during breast-feeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts that paint descriptions of unhealthful food.
The breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fat, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients needed to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, the new study suggests that adding calories is not the only diet change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Professor Robert Waterland of Texas Baylor College of Medicine revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women in fact has an impact on the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from tumour development.
Unfortunately, a healthy diet was found to have negative effects on the baby’s immune system.
The Seven Channel Sunrise program is popular in viewers, despite the efforts made by Nine Channel to news in Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson’s raid on Canberra’s news of the release of the leader of the Liberal Party failed to increase Today’s audiences.
The Nine Channel's morning program was sent from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull swept out of power for Tony Abbott.
The competing program of Sunrise, which is being run by David Koch and Samantha Army, was stuck in London as part of the week of a series of sustainable international missions, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The prints of the distance did not seem to affect Australian TV viewers, since Sunrise’s average viewer value was 397 000 in five state capitals, while Today’s figure was 339 000.
Today’s average rose slightly compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000) figures, but it was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has caught Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, the average of Today was 318 000 and Sunrise was 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far, in September, Sunrise has a average of 349 000 viewers, with Today's figure of 314 000.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
The changes in the wind blow away from Parliament this morning!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!
Published on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news on the Seven Channel was 800 words series, with former Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
A new drama series, which collected a very impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with two children.
The critics have wondered if Thomson's popular series would be carried by himself without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibson.
Last night's results gave this real certainty.
Seven-channel The X Factor was a strong favourite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning the Block Series (838 000) and TBL Familys (726 000).
Seven channels had two kinds of fates on the second night of the Chase Australia series.
The first half hour (17-17.30) of Andrew O'Keefen's new visualisation program gathered 446 000 viewers in the middle wall.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623 000 viewers - which was enough to win the Eddie McGuiren Hot Seattle programme (613 000).
On Monday night the Chase Australia’s first half-hour average of viewers was 520 000, and the second half-hour figure was almost 720 000.
The average of Hot Seat was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night average of viewers brings confidence to the Nine channel that the Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute programme, which failed to reduce the ratings of the McGuire program.
Originally published in the name Sunrise rules, Today remains local
The final three is in agreement with Dad that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret is revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally discovered who wins the Bachelor series.
The identity of that woman has been kept in the extremely secret with which Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls really don't slip who got the last rose.
However, when we discussed with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could deliberately give a hint of the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final.
All three women were cast down for the reasons why they wanted to be his partner, as the perfect man mentioned, for his sense of humor, ambition, family value and positiveness.
However, when they were asked, "If the last rose of Wood is not for you, for whom should it go?", their answers could offer a revelation of who won the boy's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after them.
Between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood, we've been indiscriminate since the first day.
"From the moment I walked into the house, (Sarah) energy and Sam's energy seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind all the time", Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really close, it's fun to be with him," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good partner.
Mackay said last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be "the right one".
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game, I am with my whole heart here," he said.
When asked who Wood should be elected if not him, Mackay was worthy.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the remaining girls as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on the Ten Channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in him after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have asked about him for his impressive open training day after the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some trainers would have left Hayne's swap bench for the rest of the game after the turn of the Australian rugbyliiga dropped the ball in return to the team on Tuesday by reading 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Haynen return the next shot and took her into the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
The real nature of Tomsula also appeared in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of barking out his new recruit before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at the post-game press conference.
Special editor of 49ers Cam Inman reported that Haynea was also encouraged by the coordinator of Special Teams Thomas McGaughey, who instructed him to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the plane shot in the first quarter of Minnesota Vikings.
This really wasn't the beginning that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wanted him to be NFL-debyty.
Hayden was seen climbing on the way from the field after the drop, and later he told the Australian radio station Hamish & Andy 2DayFM at a frequency of 104.1 that he would not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"It's just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his acidification to his 2007 Origin debutes when the input in his own goal zone led to Queensland's goal.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posted his Instagram account in the photo with fans, holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovski, was arrested under threat of a cyperian runway.
Hodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 When the police fired rubber bullets against protestors in Nepal
Four people, including four-year-old boys, died in the south of Nepal after the police shot rubber bullets in the crowd, who expressed their view on the new draft Constitution of the country, were told by the Authority on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in Rupandeh district about 175 miles west of Katmandus, the capital of the West.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior official of the region, said that more than 1000 protestors had been gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they could get into the rubber bullets.
Twenty cops and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative appeared to have caused so many deaths.
The integration was in the last few weeks of violent demonstrations across Nepal, where members of the ethnic group called Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new Constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group calls for its own state.
After 10 August, at least 40 people have died at violent gatherings, 11 of which have been police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement to distribute the country to the provinces - this is a big step towards the new Constitution, but a very controversial matter in Nepal, which has been a central government for centuries.
The new Constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
This week, the legislators have voted on the clauses of the Constitutional Code for Katmandus, and the authorities have said that the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
The US National Hurricane Centre NHC says that the southern side of Cape Verde has a 60% chance of a round storm.

The second limited low pressure, located in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands group and the Pieten Antillies, also has a 60% potential to develop into a tropical cycle storm in the next two days, increased the weather forecast centre in Miami.
Google starts the donation campaign with the goal of collecting 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc. (GOGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations that help thousands of refugees who have come to Europe in their escape from the countries of war and poverty.
Google had an exceptional personal view of publishing a donation campaign in its blog.
Instead of making the announcement, Google’s employee, Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with his family at seven years of age.
"Our journeys included numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But when the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
You will receive four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google reported that it corresponds with the same amount for donations made on the Google.com/refugeerieef website worldwide up to $5.5 million, with a total target of $11 million.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe has been going on since the Second World War, and it is mainly the reason for Syria's four years of civil war, which has driven more than 4 million people from its homes this year.
Many also run away from war on Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Dehydration surgery can help mildly obsessive diabetics
According to the new study, the benefits of thinning surgery for patients with mild type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years.
It is still too early to say, however, whether these mildly over-saltered diabetics are living after decontamination than those treated in other ways than in surgery.
"The access to death data takes a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He's a weight loss expert who wrote the final report in the new JAMA Surgery Journal.
Different methods of reducing the size of the abdomen are used in the application of dilution i.e. bariatric surgery.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of subjects in the study have been sickly fat, and their weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. the ratio of weight to length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person has more than 30 BMI, it is considered to be over-muscle.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers in the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Thailand used data collected from 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery and stomach reduction, treatment for type 2 diabetes patients who were mildly over-muscled.
The study showed that the average BMI of slaughtered persons fell from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, those who were treated with other means than surgery remained the same about 29 C.E.
Of the people who had been cut, 36% of the patients had complete and 28% had a partial improvement in diabetes.
In view of the comparison, only 1 % and approximately 2% of patients in the medicated group improved diabetes completely.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and the "bad" LDL cholesterol "are generally better in the surgical group", the writers said.
In addition, investigators followed the blood levels of haemoglobin A1c that reflect long-term blood glucose levels.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7 %, and researchers should write.
After surgery, hemoglobin A1c fell from around 9% to around 6%.
However, in the treatment group, it remained stable at around 8%.
However, this better glycaemic control, described by improved haemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality in five years, says the lead investigator, Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results between two different types of surgery.
For the fifth year, when compared to the group in the stomach reduction surgery, the group in the stomach bypass surgery had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), lowering more to the body weight index (7.4 and 5.1), lowering the haemoglobin level of A1c (3.1 % and 2.1 %), and more likely to have achieved full diabetes remission (46.9% and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenixin Blackstone says that although the research does not appear to have survived or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where surgery led to longer life in the most difficult people.
In the Swedish study, 29% lower probability of dying of obesity during the 15-year period was found to be compared with a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not seem to improve the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging to people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
"The results of the investigation are crucial precisely because they show that the surgery is safe for the lower weight index group", and does not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their physicians should take the weight very seriously at the time of the patient’s BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, the withdrawal of the situation is very difficult.
"All cannot enter Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Mr Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees by adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis is found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibet's Buddhism has called for the end of violence in refugees' countries.
The Dalai Lama discussed the current refugee crisis in his speech, which he held at the opening of his ten-day visit to the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion Centre in Oxford, the Centre is dedicated to the study of ethics.
The Dalai Lama claimed that, in the current situation, all mankind’s needs should be put ahead of individual peoples or even continents.
He also stressed that although the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis needs to be admired, it is also insufficient.
"Everything can't come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the German and Austrian activities in the crisis, she stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of a number of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime it is necessary to consider long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development into these Muslims, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
Power has never solved these problems," he added.
In view of the question of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's action after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the US violent response caused the brutal events of the chain.
"I gave my condolences to President Bush in my letter after 9/11 and told him that there was a solution to this problem through violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used power and created unexpected consequences", Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, swallowing of a child’s hand-held agent has increased by fourfold.
The United States has reported strongly an increase of almost 400 % in the number of children under 12 years of age in swallowing an alcohol-containing hand-inspiration agent, reports Georgia's Poultry Information Centre.
According to the Director of Georgia's Poultry Information Centre, the use of disinfectants reported in the GLYlord Lopez sites in children under 12 years of age rose from 3266 cases in 2014 to 16117 cases.
"Lopez is more interested in these products, and unfortunately a certain percentage of them are due to the emergency police," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant by purpose, while some want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge of social media.
There are videos in YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap riser.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed the disinfectant with alcohol-containing oral water to obtain a stronger drink.
Efficient disinfectants can attract younger children.
"Lopez doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many more interesting (instruments) are those that have been added to their scent.
There are mansika, grapes and orange-producing disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
The hand disinfectant may contain any alcohol between 45 % and 95 %.
In particular, small children need only a few injections of alcohol poisoning.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," said Mr Stephen Thornton, Head of Health Care at the University of Kansas Hospital Hospital Hospital Hospital, who told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a whisky house on the table, but the hand-infectant is left out, and if the kids are interested in it, it's a fast way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six - year - old girl who, for some time ago, swallowed only four injections of mansiccan products into the hands of a school disinfectant, and he was taken for first aid.
His blood's alcohol level was .179, which is twice the limit of the adult race, says a first-aid clinic doctor, Chris Ritchey, who handled a girl outside of Atlanta at the Gwinnet Medical Center.
Nhaijah, when he spoke to you, couldn't walk when he came to first aid.
The doctors followed him overnight in a separate children’s hospital for possible symptoms of brain injury, for alcohol made the girl fall and hit her head, Ritchey told me.
"It was really scary," said Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott to CNN.
The situation could have been lethal to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and move the disinfectant away from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with death.
In 2013, two ontarious women died after swallowing the hand disinfectant containing toxic, unreported ingredients.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of the state of New York, three fourths planned to poison their "bad" teacher by spreading bacterial poison to the classroom, reports the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the disinfectant and denied it in his class.
The police need to prevent the plan from being "switching" and leave disciplines in the school circle.
Celtic has no contradictions.
The Griffiths are a little less talking about Celtic crucifixion, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight place, but he can turn it around.
Hearts fighting Scotland's football union against Neilson's charges, and Warburton is on guard for January recruits that can interfere with the unity of the team.
Dons raised his lead to Celtic five points.
Adam Rooney's first half-time penalty was taken to the narrow victory of Aberdeen from Hamilton at the Pittodrie Stadium and allowed the team to raise the difference between Celtic and five points.
Griffiths has reduced his talks about cross-criminalism.
There are rumors about the intra-Celtic crucifixions, but Griffiths passed them right away. He claims that he and his teammates have no sense of working under a more precise eye when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship is a waste of the Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers' middle field player and former Dutch country team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition from the championship with the Rangers.
The current Ambassador of Ajax de Boer said, "There are no more highlights of Celtic's games and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about the Rangers' return.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
The games of these teams have a lot of tensions, and also the non-Scottians want to follow these games.
Deila swears to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn around.
Lose Malmö and the resulting fall of the Master's league quickly followed the loss of ten men to Aberdeen, which is now at the top of the series by five points apart from the next.
But Delia said, "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we're up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are well, very angry or sad about what is happening.
We are, too, but we must continue.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton on January transfers
Although the Rangers bomb Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commenting on potential items of January players' transfers, he is guarded from the most colourful, convincing that he does not want to confuse the unity of the team.
Former Brentford's boss said, "The January migration window is very different compared to the summer window."
For future players in the summer, the adjustment period is the entire time before, which is reflected in our team in this period.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can make more trouble.
Celtic's interest in Michu suggests a stay
The Swansea attacker, Michu, whose name is attached to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has suggested that he can retire after his contract with Swans is over.
A 29-year-old player's had up to two years of anklets, and he couldn't find a new company outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts are ready to fight against the Scottish football union because of Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team disappeared after this 3-2. The defender's red card was later revoked, and this was already the third red card condemned by Collum in the last eight months, which was cancelled.
Neilson stays behind his message saying, "I did not question honesty, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The loyal Hibernian player was snooped after he was given singing an offensive song about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in the pub at Edinburgh Roseburn, before Edinburgh derby Tynecastel's stadium in March 2014.
"It was derby in question, and it was a moment'," the attacker added, "It's safe to say that I'm not going back to Tynecastle if I don't go to Celtic."
Tannadice's government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United government still has faith in the ability to reverse the situation, but admit that the decline of players has to stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back to work," Donnelly says.
McInnes is happy about the "crazy victory" game in Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdee, was desperate to play against Hamilton Accis, but thanks to Adam Rooney's first half-time penalty kick, managed to achieve the seventh consecutive overprofit that lifted them up at the top of the table five points above Celicia.
McInnes says, "There is no team that would have won anything, was it a poster or too, which would not have won games in this way."
Scotland's unemployment remains the same as the United Kingdom's overall population
EMPLOYMENT In Scotland, 164 000 people remained in the period between May and July, at the same time as the total number of 10 000 people in Britain rose to 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than in the UK 5.5 per cent, the figures of the National Statistical Centre (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over three months, and the number of employed persons is now 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland decreased to 74 per cent during the quarter, which is above the UK average by 73.5 per cent.
The Scottish State Secretary David Mundoll commented on these most recent figures: "The long-term plan of management is to build a basis for a stronger economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of Britain.
In these 12 months, the labour market in Scotland has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has decreased.
Why I witness execution in Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention, I will see later today when a man is executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting at the viewer's magazine at Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed with a deadly fist.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death.
I received a request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I'm starting to get a lot of trouble this day as I approach it.
So why did I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Of course, suppliers have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and since applications are often more than free places, participants are selected through a terrible value.
Oklahoma has reduced the places reserved for the media to twelve to five.
Whoever's going to be elected is looking at the event cool.
I can't do it.
I'm gonna sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've also made my contact with him through months of calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a reporter, so I can't have a notebook and pen to record what I saw.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
One of the occult journalists in Twitter accused me of being neutral.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story in the way he wants you to take part.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that "you could have done better than his word," but he still feels that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't even do that if he said it.
I've told him he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international supplier to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help to counter the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is right next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to a series of podcast broadcasts I've done.
I won't go through all the details again.
I can't be sure to say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Trees was murdered would, in any case, make him help the guilty.
But I believe that there is a very strong chance that he has not committed a murder.
I'm sure there was not enough evidence justifying the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And so this is the point of view I see him die from.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other suppliers here who will take care of it.
I give you a description of what it feels like to watch a man I like dies unnecessaryly.
The man was dragged away from the Canning River River after the police hunt.
The Canning Vale officer remained dry when he lured him out of the Canning River River.
The attempt of a man from Perth to distract the police from his canoes went wrong when he found himself in a low, soft water only one meter away from a police officer who tried to “suffer him mildly back to the beach.”
The Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday because of an unauthorized invasion of Beckenham.
When they found the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He was standing in the water saying, "I'm not coming out, come get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to grow up, so he used safer tactics: "Congratulation of the Government".
"A lot of people do funny things trying to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master's ball player Ben Cousins is an impressive example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River River.
He did not succeed in his business, but inspired the locals to start a playful Ben Cousins design.
Peter Moody claims that the contractors were trying to spy on him and threatened to stop competing.
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's contractors tried to infiltrate his deposits last year, and threatens to stop competing immediately.
On Wednesday, Lady Tatai's late rejection due to the treatment of the day of the race, he claims to have a personal campaign against him.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for competition, and that he has been in a difficult situation after Lidar's inexplicable positive cobolt sample.
He's been keeping his tongue under control for a year and a half, and he didn't want "it looks like envy".
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet for a long time, but sometimes it's frustrated so much that it all goes off at a time," Moody said.
They knew the situation was going on.
Sometimes all I have to do is react and live with sanctions, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm sleeping well.
I want to head up, and I want the owners to think that I'm doing my best in front of them.
When they start to think differently, I don't have to go on being a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm doing to my license.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb on racing.com site at an interview where he told me that the D.A. had tried to spy on his stable.
"Six months ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in the room with a man when I asked him and offered him a job on my deposit if he cares about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a cheater.
If that's the case, it's true they should fire their lawyer, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, the current Chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all clear about this at that time and they are all clear about it today.
Should I start thinking this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to become a man and perhaps to pass on responsibility to others other than coachmen about what is happening in the field?
Am I in harm's way?
Am I so harmful to the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I've said now might make them think about it.
But I'm at the point now that I don't care anymore, and it's killing me.
It really makes me sad.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my back on this one.
The frustration of the coach has increased with the long-term Kobolt Study of Lidar, and the late rejection has led him to find that he could "switch his license over the table".
Moody, who is best known for coaching the undefeated master Black Caviar, has called the rule of day care for the race day after being put on horse feet, which is illegal.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees put it on the wrong foot.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could've had it yesterday, just like it was.
It was on the day of the race.
Moody may face a three-month ban on competition due to day-care treatment, from which the operators started the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"All of us understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver responsible for the carriage in Cobra has been arrested
The police have arrested a man who committed a traffic escape after he hit a biker during the weekend in Cobra.
The biker was transported to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he had severe injuries when the car hit him on the highway of Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
The police told me that the driver drove away and didn't stop to help the injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia reported himself to the police at Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in the event of an accident, failure to provide assistance, as well as other traffic offences.
The biker, 40-year-old man from Cobra, is still in the hospital, and his condition is stable.
Coach Craig Bellamy, the Melbourne Storm team, attacks the competitors in their claims.
Coach Craig Bellamy, Melbourne Storm, has criticised even the claims made by the two NRL-rugbylig masters that his team's charges are part of the "line".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the erotics allowed Storm's "pain" on their own, as it suddenly won the finals in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely covered his reference to Storm after he won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the final race. Bennett called the game a rugbylig "show" and said that two of the Queensland teams were not "severally excited" button.
Bellamy defended his team's charges and said that they were just focusing on the "to the contact" box.
Bellamy added that his trust was increased by two leading coaching criticisms about Storm, for that means they fear losing to the team.
"It's always gonna be a conversation. I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking when we lost them 24-2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything in our defence systems or our technologies all year round, and in the last six weeks, we've only made contact with the bars and it's made us succeed.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he clearly has a great team to train, so he is probably not used to losing, and so this was a little shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of a "sufficient rugby" by reminding her mentoring that Bennet's coached St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by "seriously".
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his game on Saturday night to our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 how St George was often criticised for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he's got a team that can play a rugby we find exciting, especially when he's got quick young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have its type of players.
He brought it up on the side of 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style as a rugby, not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I'm going to be more confident when they say things like this because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as opposed to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more scored than the game between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting violation of the defense line and not paint it?
This is what I'm talking about.
If they mention us, it means that we can play against them at some point.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game either for North Queensland Cowboys or against Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night to the pre-final AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold first Tuesday morning.
Serbimier's $200 guarantee for drug charges.
A man who is in danger of a lifetime of holding 40 cocaine kilograms smuggled into Queensland has been released against a guarantee amount of $200 000.
The 29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men arrested last month after the federal police were tracking 100 pounds of drugs on the Solay hunt, which came to South America through Vanuatu and served in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting other accused shipporters all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in the Tokyo Echo car.
Although Maximovich is threatened by a possible life-long period of possession of cocaine for business, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maximovic tried to hold the entire amount and that he could have been in the cafe for absolutely innocent reasons.
The Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has fixed links to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of a criminal court, Maximovic lied to the police about the place he lived in.
Together, Maximovic's mother and stepfather had offered a $200 000 guarantee to ensure his release.
"It is clear from both persons that setting a guarantee of $ 200 000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But alone it was not enough to stop him from coming to justice, he warned.
Maximovic was granted guarantees on condition that he would hand over both Australia and Serbia's passports, report to the police every day and hold his outdoor ban between the evening and the morning.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures.
The pedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this girl when she was sleeping and then entered the online communications service where Hogg received numerous unscathed photos of children sent by another user to her.
She woke up later, and she noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping on Hogg's hand.
She looked at her phone and found the shocking messages, and immediately she told her mother about it.
When the police saw five photos, looked at the computers on the ground, and found "maintenanceable" web searches in search of images taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this "to flatter pedophiles on the Internet" before he said "to pretend he was a cop to scare them."
Fiscal depute, Eilidh Robertson, told the Dundeen Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addict that he was dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had completed his search on a computer but said that they had been done only because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so he could scare pedophiles.
He was asked about discussions with an unknown person who sent him the pictures, as well as when Hogg asked him to send more pictures.
Hogg said he was just doing this for bait.
He said after drinking, he's sick, and he wants to watch pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "When the girl found the pictures of her phone, she yelled at her mother, shaked and cried.
My mother saw unscathed pictures on the phone, and then she met the defendant.
She was interviewed, and she told me that the accused had used the computer and the Playstation to talk to the girls who looked younger than her.
The 23-year-old Hogg, on Ward Road, in Dunde, accused of making or taking photos of innocent children on the 14th of June of last year, of breaking the ban on 25 January of this year and failing to take a trial on 24 March of this year.
The defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be entered into a sexual criminal record, as it can be argued that his crimes were not a "markable sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October so that social activity has time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was granted guarantees in this case, but in other pending cases he is arrested before processing.
He was added to the sex offender record before the day of judgment.
Mr Mugabe, Zimbabwe, gave the wrong speech to Parliament
The oldest leader in Africa, Mugabe, fell on the stairs leading to the speaking age earlier this year.
He didn't get hurt, but the video of the fall spread like a virus in social media.
Parliament's opening remarks were also made by the opposition's legislators that they had been sent anonymous death threats, warning them not to bloat Mugabe during his speech.
In the last month, they bouted and interrupted him in mid-terms when he gave a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - which he repeated on Tuesday.
The group leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said Innocent Gonese had received text messages from seven opposition politicians who warned them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The figure from which the message was sent does not answer, but the message title is 'death', Gonese told journalists after the talk by Mugabe.
The message warned the relevant Members that immunity would end in Parliament, and when they step out, parliamentary immunity would not be in force.
The group leader said that the party that led Morgan Tsvangirai is "in its care" about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-setting efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP is divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from faster growing business equipment and service activities.
The expected job cuts will bring around $2.7 billion in expenses from the fourth quarter, the HP report said.
"These restructuring measures allow for a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP president and CEO, who will lead the unit after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the present-HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that help companies move to a new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
The annual turnover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be over USD 50 billion and will be "focused on producing non-comparative integrated technology solutions for companies" will be reported in the company's communication.
The division disintegrates the company Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who graduated from the Stanford University University University University, to produce electrical supplies. The company worked in a garage in Palo Alto, called "Pilaakson's birthplace".
HP has been through a huge restructuring process to find out about the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology figures in the US, and its distribution is the last sector based on the belief that tightly limited companies are better performing.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Arteta says that the teammates must support the injured Jack Wilsherea before the Dinamo Zagreb game
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and, assuming that he goes on according to plans, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshir will miss at least four of the next English games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European Championship next summer.
The biggest pity in this latest problem is that the end of Wilsher's last season was strong after a single one, and he remembered his old steely before the beginning of the season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger admitted, when a player tries to return through there is always a risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable model in fashion.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilsher has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, during the last five years, he has only played 65 games out of 157 league games of Arsenal.
In view of Arsenal's wider total after the 2007-08 season, it has been one of the eight teams of the Valoliiga who have lost most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the opportunity of a witch, but Arsenal believes that their improvement in disability statistics will continue in the past period.
"At least when we get back from the injury, there can be a risk of a period when we need to strengthen the body and get competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will be stable, I am sure that it will happen and that he will be able to make a career as he deserves.
Wenger prepares to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his master's game on Wednesday nights against Dinamo Zagreb, then play against Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also put Kiera Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott in place.
"I'm trying to maintain a balance and give the rest to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear extension of Section F, Maximir's stadium in Zagreb is the scariest thing in Europe.
Neither has Dinamo lost its 41 fights since they produced their own "Undefeated" campaign last season.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was rocked by an earthquake of 3.2 Richter.
It was the tenth of Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned that last year's Master's league was to surrender against Monaco, and he is still motivated by a distant dream leading the team to its first victory in Europe.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not wounded.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is impressive to see how there are no similar descriptions in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates for young men are higher than 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
The company caught the problem of Campaign Agaginst Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 for men. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they needed it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
In the recent study, more than 2,000 upper secondary and upper secondary school pupils who showed symptoms of depression were involved. According to the study, the possibility of a person to recover doubled if the percentage of his friends was “goodly”.
Similarly, those who were not depressed were half the likelihood of developing possible mental health problems if they were happy to have healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to function, it must first be available.
In this social media time the style goes past content, and the immediateness of the answer is often more important than relevant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to look strong, happy and successful, although in reality isolation rules.
The values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this happens to the personal growth and friendship of internal values - a personal longing for friendship - at the expense of a more profoundly affecting our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really doesn't get any more happiness.
Frendi's fineness was that it turned this focus on its head.
None of the characters defined their work, but rather their personality, which was clearly interacting with each other as friends.
Joey's and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs, watching football, Ross misses Rachel - these humor came from knowing that yes, men can identify all this, even though they often hesitate to study their feelings completely.
As a volunteer worker in the Samaritans explained to me: ..."I listened to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I have truly understood how the smallest interaction with a friend can improve their feeling."
Often, men who contact us feel like they can't talk to friends.
The old idea of getting over is strong, as well as the feeling of opening up problems is seen as weak.
Frendit is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term means of survival.
It brought up the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my objective, external position on the other end of the phone helps people in desperate moments, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friends' network.
And then if you participate in Comedy Central FriendsFesti this weekend, and all the presentations are redesigned to celebrate, why don't you take your friends back to Central Perki.
Or better yet, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Frendis are sent to Comedy Central to complete the beginning, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria makes the finish and helps PSG to reach Malmö's side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan the elections against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria made the goal in her debut of the Masters, helping PSG to bypass the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Under the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his Master's league with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö on Tuesday at Parc des Princess.
Di Maria made the Masters' league debut in less than four minutes, pointing the way to the French masters, but the team lost many opportunities before finally added their way to the Cavan hit the goal in 61 minutes.
Paris, who is in the same block A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish Prime Minister, because the game was not only a follow-up but also an improvement in their quarter-line games in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took the points, it wasn't a classic game, for Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, lost the place in front of the goal and later changed from the field. Malmo is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"The master's league is not easy to win at home or in guests, so the 2-0 win creates problems for the opponent and looks good in statistics, and it is a good start, even though there are things that we will have to sand this season," Blanc said.
This is good for you.
We wanted to win, and we won, even though we did not regret doing one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team one of the three changes made after the team stayed in a 2-2 match in the Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux during the weekend, but he stayed in the fourth minute in Di Maria's shadow.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentinian wingmen were named as a man who would take PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when Marco Verratt's feed ran behind Malmö's defense line and then hit a beautiful finish by Johan Wiland to the back corner of the network.
However, if someone expected a easy and big victory from PSG, he was disappointed.
The Malmö was a blocked opponent, and it won Celtic's match at this level, with nine international players and a five-man defense, as well as two players in the deep middle field.
But the team offered nothing more than Nikola Djurjic's shot for 34 minutes, which passed the nippy button from Kevin Trapp's goal pole.
On the other hand, because of the input and the poor finishing of PSG, especially Ibrahimovic, which failed in all five companies only in the first half and then disappointed me when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic contact immediately at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in pre-working his colleagues, and Ibrahimovic's feed, Di Maria, sent a tour of a round of kicks, which shuffled Wiland's goal pole around 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally obtained after an hour after the game, thanks to the sixth of the season, the Dutch Cavan, after Ibrahimovic had moved on from the left of Maxwell's cross-street.
It ran out of Malmö's hopes of getting back into the game, and only Wiland's great fight for David Luis's direct kick kept the final numbers down before the switch came from Ezequiel Lavez's goal was completely rejected at the end of the game.
Malmö Coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was equal to his team. The Norwegian said, "Our last Master's league was last year's December."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
I don't have enough scratch fights.
I'll raise my hat to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion for stock sales
The mining industry in Switzerland left Glencore, which suffered from the deterioration in the price of the basic goods, totalling $2.5 billion in Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt- cut-off plan.
The Glencore, listed at the London Stock Exchange, reported that it had sold new shares for about 1.6 billion pounds to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with the prices of the collapsed basic goods, while the slowdown in the Chinese economy imposes on demand and causes destruction on all markets.
The new label raised the value of Glencore's shares in the morning stores at the top of the London stock exchange.
Shares rose by 2.77% in the FTSE 100 index of 131,60 pence, which opened up 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had revealed the debt burden of $30 billion as part of a $2.5 billion stock trade during the previous week.
The company sold a new share capital with 125p, which meant a 2.4% discount on Tuesday's final price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, which accounted for 9.99 percent of the total.
You will be concerned about the long-standing slowdown in China's prices of iron ore, and at the same time, prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40 per cent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping conducts a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House's opinion on Tuesday was confirmed.
Xin's first official visit to Washington takes place on 25 September and is the answer to the last November visit to Beijing by President Barack Obama, said.
The President of the United States and Vice-President Michelle Obama will arrange dinner for X and his spouse, Peng Liyuan, after having held bilateral negotiations.
"The visit by Mr Xi gives us the opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time giving President Obama and President X the opportunity to discuss constructively with differences", the expansion was increased.
At a visit that was first announced in February, Xin is also expected to depart from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet a large number of US technology leaders before he continues towards New York City and the United Nations General Assembly of September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concern regarding China's alleged online spying and the increasing independence of the country in the waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon reduces the difference in filmmaking
Matt Damon brought an African-American filmmaker with Effie Brown in their conversation about the diversity that Damon says is not needed behind the scenes.
During the Sunday evening session of HBO, an actor experienced in Project Greenlight interrupted Brown when emphasising the need for different angles of views as to the dark main person of the script chosen for the project.
"When we talk about diversity, it will be taken into account when choosing actors for the film, not the show," Damon claimed.
The shocked Brown reacted with disbelief, the comments "Oh! Wow. Okay," while The Martian's actor's comments remained hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
"I want to invite people to think, then any director is, how they treat Harmony's personal character," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark character is the whore that his white pimp beats.
The producer of The Dear White People insisted on the rights of film management for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied harshly that their direction "it should end up giving us something we don't want".
When the debate had been sent, social media blew up Damon's comments.
The Twitter user, MrPoon, expressed his anger at the film page, writing: "Mat Damon speaking to the only dark-eyed person in the room and explaining his differences is NIN VERIFICATION that happens."
The Twiittaus collected over 5000 re-witches and 4,000 delays after its publication.
Damon's comments are at a time when a precise racial presentation on the media is the front of the social debate.
Since the white police killed Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter became a countrywide and called on the legislators and authorities to put an end to colored people's discriminatory practices.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the issue as the winner of the Grammy Prize by presenting the album of the year.
"Albumes still have meaning," he said.
Like books and black animals, albums are still important.
The heads of the Black Lives Matter recently published an opinion to answer the question of whether a group should be considered an angry group by Fox News's TV nurse Elisabeth Hasselbeck.
"The Black Lives Material Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is involved in it among entertainers, producers, and media musicians who have been invited to visit the pope to discuss the picture of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope.
First American Ninja Warren champion crowned
On Monday, Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and received a million dollars' main prize.
The competition programme which ended its seventh period has never had a competitor who would have survived all the shares in the obstacle track of the programme.
In the last episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten survived the last round.
The last task was to climb a rope of about 23 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten first climbed and solved the challenge in time, which made him the first athlete of all time, who discovered the exhausting fourth part of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a hard-core victory and was still in shock for winning a million dollars' main prize.
"I mean, it's really great to think about this since I've never earned or lived more than $100,000 a year," Isaac told E! after he got a big raise.
So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what it's like... future is unknown.
Production director Kent Weed sat down to discuss with The Hollywood Reporter the final list and why Britten won't receive more reward money, even though he's the first competitor of all time, who has managed to get through the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more than one person passes, the money gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and change in life, he still gets great satisfaction.
I don't think that's why he's feeling a grudge.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family father.
He's the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I believe Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warren will return to the eighth season, whose descriptions will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- the other half of the distance has not been so much fun for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers once was one of the best baseball teams, but now he's the last American League Central division.
Tigers played the part of the ruiner perfectly on Tuesday when it won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to get up to the game-side head in the Houston Astros competition from another wild card in the American League.
The Detroit game was at least one night's return to the six-write H-word, which had been very difficult to reach most of the latter half of the season.
"All the winnings are fun, regardless of how they get," said Brad Aumus, team leader of Tigers.
The Tigers feeder Alfredo Simon continued his early attack support when Detroit three times ran in the first two shifts, and then once in the sixth and once in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) fed 6 1/3 in turn and allowed three runoffs.
This was only his third grade in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending for this year," Simon said.
It's hard for an alternate to feed every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Victor Martinez, a Vice President of Tigers, hit three times and allowed two run-ins that were his first hit-and-run since the middle of August.
This was the first night of Martinez's three punches after he four times hit Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
He said, "He was a good man," he said.
He looked good (in kick drills), seemed to be much better at hitting exercises and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three running behind in the second half of the seventh pair, and that was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Senter Byron Buxton started the alternate by hitting twice out on the left field line.
Aaron Hicks, on the right side, got home with the finger of one nest, and Simon got burned directly by the second pesse player Brian Dozier before Simon was switched to the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked to Maueria, the only player who was against, the pre-starter Miguel Sana, who pulled two nests to the left of Drew VerHagen.
When two runners were on the field and the double-crossing runner, VerHagen got a triple-street Trevor Plouffen to hit a double-game painting.
It was a record of the main series: 27 times this season, when Plouffe hit double.
After Detroit had received a check-out at the ninth initiative, Mauer pulled two hit-and-run Tigers closures against Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned Sanh in three baits in his fifth salvation.
Detroit used Phil Hughes in rust at first.
Tigers got three run-ins in the first two shifts against the right-hand veteran player who got off the list of injured before the game had been taken off for more than a month due to an infection of the lower back.
"It's obvious that I didn't want to start this kind of thing," Hughes said, "but as the game went forward, I was more comfortable, and I felt that I was able to make some nice meals on the third shift."
After he caught the beginner's first nest, he allowed another nest player to go one by one.
The right side of J.D. Martinez's walk in two fire situations brought Victor Martinez, who took himself on the middle field deck and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 tube while the runners were in good running positions.
The third player Nick Castellanos continued by hitting right and causing another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected when he tried to move forward on the third floor.
Tigers continued on the second round and received one fire, two nest situations in the running-up of James McCann and two fires, one nesting centter Anthony Gosel, followed by three-0.
"It was an important hit," Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but he flew to the right.
Hughes began to be in the feed readings and fed the virtuous third shift, after which he was replaced by the right-hand extension of A.J. Achter.
For Hughes, three run-ins were counted from six punches and a walk on four fires.
NOTE: The right-hand feeder of Tigers, Anibal Sanchez, had to be removed because of the snoring of the shoulder.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut the Sanchez shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the wounded list since mid-September due to the shoulder discharge, but he had to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, the left-handed baiter Daniel Norris is coming from the wounded list to start up against Twins.
Norris' statistics on Tigers are 1-1 in four initiatives after David Price was replaced by a left-handed feeder on 30 July.
Norris has been out since August 20th, due to a real abdominal muscle stretch.
The three series of Tigers and Twins games ends on Wednesday at the Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is based on the right-hand feeder of Minnesota against Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges us to open up the economy to the world
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told the group whose task is to direct the reform.
"It should be committed to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing transparency policy," he said when he spoke at the 16th meeting of the group leading to the deepening of the reform process.
Supporting transparency at the same time as reforms are being driven forward with more new movement and vitality, and creating a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access, a breakdown of border control principles, a call for state-owned companies to seize private capital, and a revision of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created which identifies the sectors and companies that are not allowed to invest.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
This change is significant because it plays a greater role in the allocation of resources on the market, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more transparent, says the opinion.
The government also suffocates its control of the power it distributes to companies, thus ensuring that companies themselves decide how they manage their business.
The opinion also stated that China would allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open up the sectors controlled by the state, private funding will be open to more sectors.
"The management does not change its policy with regard to foreign investment, and it will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services", said the opinion.
In addition, the "green card", the search process will be facilitated by optimizing requirements and reducing the search process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of professional qualifications for lawyers and the support of professionals and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang also attended the meeting, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunsha and Zhang Gaoli, reported in the opinion published after the meeting.
