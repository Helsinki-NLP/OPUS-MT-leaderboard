The 28-year-old kitchen champion was found dead at the mall in San Francisco.
Even the 28-year-old kitchen master who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the stairs of the local shopping center this week.
But the victim's brother says that he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him, and says, "His business was finally going well."
The body, which was found at the Westfield Mall shopping centre on Wednesday morning, was identified as a Sanfranciscola, Frank Galicia, the San Francisco D.A.
San Francisco Police Department said death was identified as a homicide and the investigation is under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABC channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a bus stop in Boston, had received his dream job as a director at the Sanfrancisco restaurant Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A representative of Sons & Daughters said that they were "crazed and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close family, and they're going to miss him very much," said the representative.
We will send our thoughts and sorrows to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was staying at the beginning of his hostess, but that recently "his business was going well at last".
"He found a place and dated a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind, and he had a big heart.
His way of knowing cohesion with the family was to make us food, to make dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of disputes.
He was a brother who was driving with the river.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an unscrupulous diamond that created brighter every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on this is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's tip line to 415-575-444.
Medical practitioners will strike: requirements for new labour combat measures
The representatives of medical practitioners have asked their trade union to adopt new anti-job measures in their disputes regarding the new agreement.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) invites the entire Council to support further work-related measures from the beginning of September.
JDC says that ministers have failed to take care of the agreement.
Doctors and medical students voted in July to reject the agreement agreed with BMA.
58% of the voting members rejected it.
In his letter published by Twitter on Thursday night, Mr Ellen McCourt, President of the JDC, said that the government had remained "seriously silent" issues which he said led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said, "In this light, the JDC Government has voted to reject the completely proposed new agreement and to demand formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain authorisation for a progressive and expanding work programme beginning early in September.
It has been observed that this year doctors have participated in six strikes, including the first complete employment status in the history of the NHS health care system.
The leader of BMA’s medical practitioners, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote had been rejected by the agreement, the conditions recommended by BMA.
He had informed the members of BMA at meetings before the vote of 55,000 medical practitioners and students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement will be ordered for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an external association?
Ele, who ended up in a crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met with one another in their hands and declared the battle of eight months of words and economic sanctions officially ended.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of St. Peter's palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
Yeah, they were talking about the event.
But Putin's smile looked violent, and he didn't exactly feel the heat, even according to his own restrained standards.
However, Recep Tayyip Erdogan kept talking about his "loved friend" Putin five times according to a report.
I went crazy on the bills.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the level before the crisis, but even to a better one.
The next day the newspapers described Erdogan's behavior as if nothing bad ever happened.
From his own point of view, his zeal described the opposite.
But a viley from Putin showed that the leader of Russia has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the reason for the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat plane on the Syrian border.
The reaction of Moscow at that time was fierce.
Putin attacked Ankar because he stabbed Moscow in his back.
It was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russia's general public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the media controlled by the government led to an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seemed to be guilty of everything.
The most serious was the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan’s own family benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria’s occupied areas of Isisi.
He's been very hard on this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia achieved some kind of victory.
The benefits of agreeing on an intricate ceasefire are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost excluded from power in the last month's failed coup.
Continued terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
Moreover, there is an economic motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been severe, especially the ban on charter flights, usually carrying several millions of Russian tourists on the coast of Turkey annually.
The figure has fallen by almost 90%.
For Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved when flights eventually continue.
They wish for a late season to be rushed to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, the state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables since the re-importation of agricultural products from Turkey.
"The tourists back there, you tomatoes back here," as described in the Vedemosta newspaper report.
But the visit also had political added value to Moscow.
There are angry Western nations in the harshness of what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
With the addition of a long-lasting grudge from the advanced EU membership negotiations, Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the coolness and to reassure Turkey's links to the western countries, comes up.
The leader of Russia certainly got out of Ankara, where he called after the revolution to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is the explanation for Moscow, who has its deep-seated fear of changing power.
So this meeting in the Prameia seaports allowed the "outer union" presented by Russia and Turkey, as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that experienced the abandonment of the Western countries and were wrongly treated, combining their powers.
These two, however, have great differences, despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently brought itself into line with the role of the peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It could be a great deal of shame that after almost three hours of initial discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed the matter.
The Turkish President was consciously avoiding responding to their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear agreement on where they can find a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and taking into account the possibility of filling in the NATO disaster when Turkey shoots down the Russian combat plane, it is certainly better that the two leaders are back in the talks.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to the back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was related to the bank's international objectives.
After almost eight years of collapse of the bank and had to be saved, it has abandoned these objectives.
At this time, the Bank's strategies have used the 'RBS' brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used for international sports sponsorship, from Six Nationsrugby to Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it is considered right to allow more national brands to come to the front.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with customers from Scotland, but it will not be relaunched again.
In England and Wales, all RBS references are changed to NatWest, with the exception of the main office and stock exchanges.
The Ulster Bank brand is already available for Irish and Northern Ireland customers.
There are other smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwania was interviewed during the tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will become our investor brand and employee employer, because we are now becoming a much more brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in its own communities, and our staff work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said that it does not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of various brands in sports sponsorship.
"It is now time for us to move in the direction of the brand bank, because in essence (we have asked questions) it is about how we can concentrate on making this a better bank for customers", the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But as a result of the work that we have been focusing on the needs of customers, not on our own, I believe that you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think time is right.
Frankie Dettor wins in Newmarket with Predilection and achieves 3000 winners
Detori sprays champagne after she has a total of 3000 winnings after double victory.
The rival Frankie Dettor confirmed his 3,000th British victory in Newmarket Friday.
He arrived on the other night in his home race on his second race at John Gosden's coaching Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this virtuous race.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
A three-time champion ofjockey Dettor, who previously won the Ghayar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional, because my family's here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Detori is sucking on the cheers when she takes up Predilection after victory.
Two contestants have achieved this virtuous obstacle competition - masterjockey Richard Johnson and an estimated 20-time champion, Sir Anthony McCoy, who had record-breaking career over 4300 wins.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 victory
Frankie is one of the best competitors of the present era, and it is not a surprise that he has reached this milestone, which few have achieved before him.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical mother-in-law separates him from the other weighing room.
He's a great ambassador for competitions, his zeal and charisma have been pulling fans into the species for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have rided with 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey for weekend and big games!
Seriously speaking, Frankie has been riding winners in Britain for most 30 years, which is wonderful to see.
He is a lively person who is a good thing for the British competition, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettor celebrated the plating brand on a plane landing from the palace.
From flying ends to plane landings, Frankie Dettor has been the face of the British race for two decades.
This has been a mountain track.
In 1996 he survived an aircraft accident and suffered a competitive ban on drugs.
Three years ago, he was difficult at the start of his return after a six - month competition ban, but he showed a remarkable nature when interviewing suspects and returning to his best condition.
And he may be going on for a long time, but, you know, Dettor's told me he'd like to continue competing for at least 50 years.
Russian Putin is the separate Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly separated Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport Affairs.
The Kremlin opinion said that Putin 'has ordered Ivanov to move away from the duties of the leader of the Russian presidential administration', but no reason was given for it.
The Deputy Director of Ivanov since 2012, Anton Vano, has been appointed to his successor.
Gogao, 44, he's a former diplomat.
He was born in the Estonian capital in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later led the president's protocol and government staff, says on the Kreml website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the main task of the administration is to support your role as Head of State, as regards the drafting of laws and the management of the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave the place and recommended that Vano be appointed to his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest allies in Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, served as a Soviet security service in the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on the state television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew from his own request.
But despite smiling at the cameras, only a few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is just some sort of power struggle after all?
No one knows yet.
But the formal argument that a man who was once advertised as a potential candidate for President suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been accepted with great doubt.
In his comments to Putin on the Kreml web site, Ivanov said "it is true that early in 2012 I asked you to give me four years of my responsibility for this very complex task, if you could even say the job, the task.
Well, now I've been chief of staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the task in December 2011.
He was former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service at the KGB, as did Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the State Security Service at the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his Deputy Director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Puti's second period, for Puti's third period would be contrary to the Constitution.
However, this task went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Before his return, the Prime Minister became president only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson got a job after he hit the producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at the scene of the series in Los Angeles.
Series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, reported his resignation in the joint opinion.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner presented an apology on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
The description site had creative differences and disputes.
I regret that it happened," he said in his opinion.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character will be removed from the FBI team series will be expected later.
A 54-year-old who has previously been involved in Dharma & Greg since its first period since 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it everything for the last twelve years," Gibson said in the opinion published on Friday.
I had hoped to be with you until the end, but that's not possible now.
I just want to thank authors, producers, actors, our incredible working group and, above all, the best fans that the series can have.
The beginning of the 12th production period of the series has been envisaged for the 28th day of September.
The mystery fish ended up in the garden in Banff.
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain thinks 75 fish could be windmills left behind by the water bike.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, published film material in Periscope, hoping that someone could explain the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now extends to Fifeen
1.35 billion projects are now expected to be ready by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry's crossing site, as well as the main bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fifeen.
It's the first of the four feathers between the "twilights" that are now about to be completed around every three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fifeta is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20 000 tons of concrete and 46 ridges.
1.35 billion projects are now expected to be ready by May 2017.
Minister for Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry's crossing point.
We all prove really impressive engineering work in this project, which has spent over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge section."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the bridge between the bridge and the bridge is a demanding operation in which the extreme dimensions of the bridge must be agreed.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge is now in place, and the last part of your deck is lying in Rosyth today, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its bridge.
Michael Martin, Head of Fort Crossing Bridge Constructions project, said: "The first stop in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this seal represents the top of construction technology.
When the last part of the road was installed and combined with the expanding roadside cover, we had to close the remaining part of the north, i.e. the inland side.
This was done by pulling the northern road coastline 700 millimetres south.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
Great, because it is 222 metres long from the ground, weighs about 6000 tonnes and has to be pulled around 3 % at the angle of slope.
It is necessary, because the allowed deviations, according to which the team worked, were small, were only a few millimeters in each direction.
I'm glad everything went well, though.
Rescue on Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky when they're alive"
Three men are "good as they're alive" after they landed their fishing boat outside of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station alarmed at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event developing on the Moelfre Bay Bay.
Three men were desperate to swim to safety while their boats went on to themselves.
"We saw a boat running closer to the men, and we imagined the worst," said Moelfren, the Roverman Vince Jones.
"Happy is the strong wind that blew it away from them by the time we got on," he added.
The local fishing boat saved two men, and the third, 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging out of a warp without a lifeboat.
The men were taken to the coastal rescue boat and returned to the rescue station.
Jones said, "These three men in water are lucky when they're alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a tracker, but somehow it's been out of the boat when the boat fell.
Someone's taking care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is honorable hunting for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but that they prefer to spend their leisure time watching the evidence.
Pokkon Go makes people rise up on the couch and participate in some action.
The time limit was initially limited to television, then to video games, and now recently to smartphones.
So it is wonderful to see that technology and outdoor activity do not close apart.
I am, of course, referring to the wildlife called Pokkoon Go. Application based on characters that were originally developed into video games in the 1990s (later became a cartoon series, game cards and other downstream products).
As many phenomena of pop culture, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the launch of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as huge popularity overburdened servers.
Only in days, Pokkémon Golla had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
As explained in the nutshell, players use their smartphones to track Pokkones, which are traced using GPS, and which can be "painted" (via a screenshot of the phone) or "sealed" after discovery.
The generation who played the game younger than the age of one has joined the wild beast and jumped up the couch according to the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the average person.
Apple Watch app Cardigram, which follows 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of publishing the game, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% in the following users.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Gota, it only sees the level of training.
Many public health campaigns are called "to shoot 30", "to pick up on the couch" and "to be active every day" have not produced any results because most of the public health warnings are boring and people who seem to be unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be reduced.
On a regular basis, there is a lower risk of cancer or depression.
Activity helps in weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes, with too many benefits to read.
The fineness of Pokkoon Gon is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air, sunshine and fun.
Some people even get new friends when they hunt.
As usual, the degenerate mercenaries are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk toward the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there were earlier applications like Fitzbit that could monitor activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The flash of freshness will disappear and the use will fall in time.
However, the success of Pokémon will result in other games that combine applications and virtual reality with the real world, helping many hunting people to be more active, better and healthier.

Simone Biles caught gold in a woman's gymnast.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to everything.
Energy jumps.
Swim on the boom.
Unbelievable permano.
It's great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast arrived at the multi-game championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between itself and the end of the world to the Olympics.
He was clearly better than the silver medalist and the "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian prossimistic Aliya Mustafina.
The United States Simone Biles has a balance sheet of women's weight-to-mortal diversity in the finals of individuals in the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman, who has successively won a multi-play championship, and all in all, the fifth American champion. At the same time, he strengthened his reputation for his generation, and perhaps for the best of all time.
He broke into tears when his final destination was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement will increase his class with the best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised his species to a new level:
Biles has ruled his species for the last three years, winning the 15 World Championships, including 10 gold, with a mixture of ambition and precision so amazing that the 1984 Olympics Master Mary Lou Retton called him "the best man to see".
The last test was in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of excessive expectations.
Returning home to Texas Spring without the coronal gold medals would have been a disappointment.
The United States Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman hugs after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the finals of the multiple women's gymnasties in the 2016 summer Olympics in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, August.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday, when he worked as a peak for the national team coordinator Martha Karoly, at the departure party.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought about the future as he passed on long notice to the top, it is not entirely truthful.
Some of his permato program, including his trademark's voltility, has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also fit the street along with the Olympics in Rio.
This isn't a coincidence.
From this girl whose grandparents adopted as a reaper, whose coach Aimee Boorman's mother found when she was on a study trip to the gym where Boorman was trained, she became a force factor.
He has not disappeared in a multi-stakeholder match since summer 2013, and this winning pipe will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just a illusion.
Balance and permut, where Biles was the ruler of the world, waited.
He rose to the top of the boom points 15.433 and exceeded them by getting 15.933 permanno.
Raisman was so kind to hug him when they were waiting for the final points, just for the formalities and tears to rise into the eyes of Biles' Glytter, White and Blue, when the dream he once wrote his playbook became true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of renegade four years ago when he was divided in third place, but he lost the pros in the rerun of Mustafia.
This time, 22-year-old team leader, called "the grandmother", was clearly in charge.
He sent airlocks to the public after his permanence, a return in a tunnel that sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as Biles is concerned, this wide-ranging 19-year-old twiittatus from this week before will have a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims were shot in the serial murder when they heard music in the car.
Two women died in the most deadly attack in Phoenix last decade, and a 12-year-old girl sat in the car and listened to music when they were shot.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on 12 June on the road.
The report states that the shooter standing on the passenger side of the car fired up to eight times and then fled with another vehicle.
According to the police, the triple death didn't seem to have been the result of a robbery, because the attacker didn't take the purses or another adult victim for $2,900.
Agent Phoenix's police officer, Officer Jonathan Howard said that the shooting got scientists to see if it was connected to four previous attacks.
All seven people have died and two wounded in nine attacks in four months, mainly in the Latin American part of the city.
"This is what happens in the residential area in front of the home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS' subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have been using several vehicles, such as the late 1990s brown Nisissa, the black BMW of the late 1990s, and the white Cadillacia or Lincoln.
Researchers have not agreed to disclose evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and are committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, due to his injuries, went to a hospital where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The witness told the police that they were often sitting in a parking lot listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting of only half an hour before the death of a three-year-old car, which they believe was also the work of a serial killer.
Researchers found bullet shells, bullet seat, and bullet chips in the engine compartment.
A 6-year-old mother with microkephagia: "Your feelings will be easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund is a little head-headed, which is the result of a genetic disorder his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
"When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I could not do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
Which is not true at all, of course I promised," he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to identify them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it,' Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with his walkers.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl like he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks with help and rides on a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sings.
Elizabeth will show me how to say "knock me" with the five-point reference to Edmund's inventions.
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a normal sign language, he tells me that Edmund has invented some of his own entertainment.
Microkefalia may be caused by a number of reasons: genetics, such as Edmund, or infections during pregnancy such as ash vaccine or Zika virus.
The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load caused by a uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know.
In fact, I haven't asked for this forecast in a while, because I don't expect anyone to actually give it to me.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have birth defects from Zista.
It'll make things easier.
You can believe it'll make things easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
The heavy rains and floods caused rescue operations in Mississippi, Louisiana
The heavy rains and widespread floods in Louisiana brought the governor to announce the emergency on Friday, and more rain was expected for the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in south-east Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded their lawns and caused widespread flooding due to extremely harsh rains.
Governor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said that the state authorities are constantly in contact with the local authorities, and that the aid is already coming into the districts that need it.
Mike Steele, a representative of the Governor's security and emergency agency, said they'd get requests for rising water vehicles, boats and sandheads.
Steele said that the province of Tangipahoa alone requested tens of thousands of sand.
The flood guard is valid until Saturday, in a large part of the south of Louisiana.
According to the opinion, the weather service is expected to increase from three to five cents in the area.
In southern Alabama, the flooder was valid on Friday when the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Commite river that flows near Baton Rouge and the Amite River that flows near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana, and they were predicted to set a flood forecast during the weekend.
Administrator Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood into several houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is lower than the flooding of the Ascension district on the river, when flooding rivers slow down into Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Maurepas.
On the south side of the state of Mississippi, the Tickfaw River in Lousian Liverpool was at the highest level of all time on Friday morning nine.
The rescuers still picked people out of flood water in the districts of Amiten and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississip.
Leroy Hansford, along with his wife and boyfriends, were near Gloster's rescues on Friday.
The 62-year-old Hansford says that, as a normal distance to more than 400 feet, the water at Beaver Creek's house rose rapidly during the night.
He says he was warned by another young boy who lived nearby.
"We woke up, and the water just continued to rise," Hansford said.
It went all the way to my waist.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she had not seen a bite of water so high in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family have all injuries and that he is the only one with the ability to swim.
Hansford said that the rescue workers saved three of them in a large, military-style truck and took them to Gloster's firehouse, where they were saved on Friday nights.
Krautmann says that the floods will quickly be "stamped" as heavy pollution continues, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that a witness near Livingston reports 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that since Wednesday, the country had been fully bored with the heavy rain.
The flooding of the rough rains and streets led to the rescue of the people of the Province of Tangipahoa from their homes and the withdrawal of lessons in five school districts, the authorities told them.
A subsidiary of CBS, WWL, reports that a member of the City Council in Tangipahoa, said that 200 homes were left under the flood.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, but both are now under the flood.
The county president, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets that had remained the island of the rising waters.
Some of them and Hammond cities have been opened up with shelters for those who have been evacuated.
"They can go back to their homes when the water starts counting," he said.
In the city of Hammond, in the province of Tangipa, twenty streets were closed because of the rising water, and the inhabitants were able to pick up sandflakes to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
"The last great flood was here in March," said the city administration, Lacy Landrum.
This is going to be a similar case.
In Mississip County Emergency Director Rupert Lacy said that the steady rain continued on the Gulf coast of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday, the coronal houses were reported to have been flooded, but so far, no floods have been reported.
Keith Townson, director of the Shopper Value Foods, has lived in the region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and the rain still continues."
"Today's bullets" was six-year-old Mahád Brown to survive the shooting at Philadelphia.
The police say that six-year-old boys have been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old shot in town this week.
The kid's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name is Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown had multiple gunshot wounds, including the neck, leg, hand, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was moved to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," says Delores Melendez, the boy's grandmother.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy’s condition has been recorded as critical and several surgery has been performed.
The family tells the station he's expected to recover.
The boy was about to start his first grade in local primary school.
Brown was one of four shooting people in the Germantown quarter.
Three men were also shot, two 29 years old and one 32 years old.
One man aged 29 was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were stable according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at the front seat of the car in conjunction with a critical state of 29 years of age, the position reported.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
Researchers tell CBS Philadelphia that there appears to be a cross between multiple shooters.
The attack-type seals, which are derived from various attacks, filled the site.
It seems that this was definitely a constant struggle.
There were shells on the street on both sides of the footwalk.
"It seems, therefore, that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were active in the fight," said Anthony Ginaldi, police chief of Philadelphia.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No arrests have been made and the data received indicate that the police investigates the surveillance camera's tapes.
Another six-year-old girl, she got a misguided hit on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's getting better, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
So I call this year's Olympic Olympic team for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to all summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been this dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, will be all proud.
This team looks like, finally, America.
It has also established the presence of dark-eyed and Latin-American women at the top of the species.
The most successful female forces in the last four years have been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were the first and the second.
This is awesome.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas surprised me as an Olympic winner, and America was cheering.
Now the world has proved the incredible performances of three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, where they present unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman who has successively won a collection of women's multiplayers.
And the teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation doesn't look like this gym of gymnastics across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all walked the same path as Aly and Madison reached the Olympic team.
They are "Final Five" (last five) because there will be only four gymnasts in the following Olympics, and this will be Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics are an expensive species, and the gymnastics generally practice in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay training, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for trainees and their gymnastics and families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous suburbs, which can support the species.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive all their training, and this is a costly and long-term commitment to the family of the gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles coach, and Maggie Haney, coaching Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started their gymnastics.
We should bring more favourable and available gymnastic training to communities where numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I set up my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organisations we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harle for more than 15 000 urban young people (mainly black and Latin) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (to my hometown) to offer high-level gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this significant Olympic species.
Powerists develop body power, flexibility, and coordination, as well as the gravity, discipline, and determination of mind.
This combination offers life-long benefits for good health and for school and work.
This team's inspiration makes thousands of young girls start up for power, and it's awesome.
Participation in sport is so important, especially for girls.
We're living an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for pointing out to be taken seriously by winning the Olympic team, and that you are motivated by so many young girls coming from different backgrounds to start on their way towards health, strong and successful young women.
Doctors are organising new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped that they would cease the changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with the staff of the British Medical Association, but 58% of the 37 000 doctoral practitioners who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force an agreement, saying that NHS was on "unidentified soil", and that even minor delays harm staff and patients.
The first doctors will be transferred to a new agreement containing changes in the way they work night and weekend in order to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Medical Training Committee, said: "Doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, in particular by stimulating the existing labour crisis, and that it does not treat all doctors equally."
While the first group of doctors are being transferred to the new agreement for only eight weeks, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced the government's lack of willingness to participate and, from time to time, deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of doctors.
If he doesn't do that, medical practitioners are ready to continue working.
At the end of April, the most recent strike meant a delay in almost 13 000 routine surgery and 100 000 receiving hours when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to act as physicians in the strike.
Ministers had hoped to end the changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with the staff of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 55,000 doctors under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to medical practitioners so that they would not strike.
Mortimer said, "Employment achieves very little or nothing, but it puts pressure on the teams and services already in need, and causes concern, anxiety and disturbances to patients, carers and their families."
During the last two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of surveillance (Guardia Role) and phenomena (Whistleblowing).
Employers had hoped that a continuous positive debate on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, further education, training costs, mutual recognition of the programme, study leave and gender pay differences in medicine - was a sign of respect for the agreements reached by employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in November, February and May with BMA.
Two quid daily medicines can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from two pounds a day after the authorities recommended that it be given to people longer.
A blood-absorbing medicine, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of renewable seizures in people with heart disease.
It is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizure.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to continue to calculate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Approximately 140 000 people get a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of them get another seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are due to the build-up of the artery wall fat that forms a vacuum.
If a clot breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood flow to the heart causing a heart attack.
If the clot is removed, it can go with the blood and break the bloodstream into the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already received one scene have increased the risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by AstraZeneca, a company in Isobritan, and sold by a trade name called Brilique, reduces this risk by making coagulation less likely.
The NICE draft guidance recommended today is that patients should be given 90 mg of tiagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, Head of NICE Health Assessment Centre, said: "In spite of the availability of effective measures to prevent progress, even one quarter of people who have had a heart attack will later receive another heart attack or stroke, which often have devastating consequences."
The fear of renewal can have a significant negative effect on the quality of life of the person.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in calculating the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we initially recommend ticagrelor we are pleased to add available treatment options to thousands of people who may benefit from it.
As data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, particularly as regards the risk of bleeding, are limited for periods of more than three years, no longer treatment is recommended in the draft guidance plan than for this period.
The culture of political correctness allows the pollen to flourish in Muslim regions
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed last year because of corruption, giving impetus to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to a widespread vote in Muslim communities being ignored, revealed in today's shocking government report.
Former Minister of Government Sir Eric Pickles set up a police officer, election supervisors and city councils for ignoring the evidence of the election field due to the 'racial and religious hypersensitivity'.
The former Secretary of the Community, the present Emperor of Corruption, said that the fear of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to place security chains in order to protect those who have been scared out of voting positions.
He recommends that voters present a identity card when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter only has to say his name and address.
The report even proposes that the finger of the voting person be placed in an unsolved ink so that no one can vote twice.
We should better protect the publishers, Sir Eric says.
He called for more access to the press in the mandate documents and decisions taken by the informal committees or the working group.
"This would not protect the local government from a culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with the electoral field," he said.
The government ordered the report as a result of the vote scandal at Tower Hamlets in Eastern London.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The Court stated Rahman's "seriously deceiving" religious feelings of his Muslim community, as well as his disproved critics of racism and Islam.
Rahman is said to have led his election campaign on the grounds that there was a religious obligation of faithful Muslims to vote for him.
Even 300 votes were suspicious or the result was that a person would vote in another.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of the lightning in the entire country.
He expressed particular concern at the election field post where members of the high-value Muslim community were said to pressure the people to vote on the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations on the clearance of the voting system, including on the verification of identity by ID
He says in his report: "The evidence was presented that the vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were forced to vote according to the parents' will, especially in those communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"It was expected that...the national institutions had ignored such behaviour because of the 'politically correct' race and the hypersensitivity to religion."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists would be allowed to deal with the voting flags that came on the post so that the 'voting of votes' would end.
The report, which Theresa May is examining, also calls for stricter amendments to be made to the register in order to prevent the use of the electoral register of offences on immigration and compensation.
Examine options for proof of the identity of voters before voting.
Use the finger of the unlossable black person to make sure that no one can vote twice.
Run systematic nationalism checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set the limit of three years for requests for automatic mail voting.
Disable political activists from dealing with the votes and envelopes that have been reached through the mail where the votes are sent.
Let the police set up security chains around the polls.
Change the law so that it is easier to accuse people of being scared on the basis of the People Act 1983.
Make the photo out of the polls illegal.
It is required that voting points use only English (except in Wales).
Strong training to ensure that the staff adheres to the rule that the voter must go to the hanger alone.
Sir Eric will give the police forces to the Great London to say that it's "mortifying" that no criminal charges have been charged after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Court stayed as a result of numerous acts of corruption and illegality of Lutfur Rahman and his officials," he said.
He was found guilty on the basis of a number of grounds, without doubt, according to the threshold of evidence of criminal law.
He also criticises the inefficient 'rare to the grid' checks in the polling agencies of the City Councils.
Sir Eric said, "For the last year, the Tower Hamlets trial was a wake-up.
Our people have a magical heritage as a source of the parliaments, but this worrying and secretive division of elections and the denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Crazy Kate's biker double solo and other famous images of Rio Olympics
This week, fans of Rio 2016 Olympics have gone out of French biker Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, proven to be a double-acting duo of Cambridge's Duke.
But the 24-year-old Olympics are certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who can boast of his own famous double being, at least according to social media.
So for the honor of the famous faces on Rio's races and all of our screens, FEMAIL has prepared a list of Olympic athletes who look like Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. Men's Fleet Team, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to Kate's dual being found on the bike track, many people online have been quick to note how a certain springmike could be star Leonardo DiCaprio twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S., has caused a storm on Twitter since the surface rose into his pictures, where he looks like the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, when he became aware of the rush of social media, the archeologist admitted that he had heard of Leo since he was a child.
"I don't see a big match except for the beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will also be raised this year: a dazzling similarity between British long jumpers Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The biggest Russian gymnast Alya Mustefina, with its obvious eyes, has been said to be a double creature of the Cuban American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been comparing the Glee star to Matthew Morrison for years.
Larger switch to eye: This user thinks Nathan is an Inception actor's "sport version"
Another long-term comparison has been between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and the actor Josh Hartnett, having both of the same strong corners and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than the same actor as Annalynn McCord's tanned skin and pale hair, whereas Nathan Adrian, a U.S. team, reminds fans that "Joseph Gordon Levit's sporting version".
Hard women: Football Star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share the same face and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Presentation of the theory: According to this user there may be a reason for a pair of similarities
One Twitter user recently expressed on the site his happiness that "other Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the United States football star and Dexter's actress have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and his smile, which is a nearly identical actor with Laura Linney's smile, as well as the gold medal won by Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful, wide smile match the Bring It On star Gabrielle Union smile.
CBC Olympic Commissioner apologizes to the Chinese swimmer "to death like a pig"
The analysis of Byron McDonald's 14-year-old Ai Yanhan instead of the fourth message of women's 4x200-metre freebreed was agitated by the viewers of the CBC's direct Olympics on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC had to apologize after one of its browsers said that during the 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "lost of evil" and "death like a pig" during the race.
Analyst Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions on women's 4x200 meters of free-at-air mail.
MacDonaldi, who came to the CBC's reporting team to bring "color", was told to say, "That little 14-year-old from China was your dick, baby.
Too excited, lost like a bad smell, dead like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Ai Yanhan, Chinese maid, 14 swimming message at the time of the second part 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which enabled Canada to catch China.
The viewers from all over Canada react quickly to the language used and the tone of the web.
Emmett Macfarlane twit: "The CBC reporter just said that China's 14-year-old swimmer was dead like a pig?
The idiot didn't realize he was still on a direct mission."
China's Ai Yanhan was described in a women's free swim of 4 x 200 metres' note as follows: "That little 14-year-old from China, you've had a party, baby."
The review of Byron against MacDonald on Twitter was a tough and fast, for many to challenge him.
Twitter users didn't arrest themselves when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like a racist group.
Soon thereafter, Scott Russell, who was running the CBC's broadcast, asked for an apology on a direct broadcast from MacDonald's comment, saying: "We regret that the comment on the swim performance was sent.
It was a unfortunate choice of words, we regret that it did this."
The CBC decided to apologize more than 90 times to people who had ceded in response to the comment.
Scott Russelin, the reporter, had to apologize for MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and attached an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The Tv company also quickly apologized and published a statement.
We deeply regret the fact that these statements were made and that they were sent straight.
Last night, we quickly took action and asked our viewers and our followers in social media for their direct transmission.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized for his direct transmission and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize at this moment for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said at the CBC Olympics.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person."
"It's unnecessary to say that I didn't mean it was disrespectful, and I'm really sorry."
Primark's client was stunned by a woman who was so rudely matching her underwear in the middle of the store
Customers didn't know what to look at when a woman was sitting in the middle of a Primark movement to try underwear.
The things that didn't improve, after assessing what she looked like in her pants, she peeled them off her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour, and eventually made arrangements for four underwear in the store that was at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkeston.
The Primark Movement at the Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkeston, where she agreed to the underwear and then put them back on the shelf.
At the same time, the mother of two children at the store, Jenny Davidson, said that after experimenting with the mysterious woman, she "stomached again and walked away from the store without buying anything".
He said, "The people didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the shop floor, took her underwear, took off her own stockings and underwear, and put on her feet.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place to settle, he just stood there shameless."
"They all stared when he again took off the underwear and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before finally decided not to like anything he saw again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about someone who would end up buying the underwear he made up."
33-year-old Davidson, living in Kent's town, said, "It is disgusting to think that someone is taking the underwear that someone else has tried, but they have not been cleaned."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I said, "I apparently tried to remove the clothes from the sale after she left, which is good."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on top and removed them, and they have not been washed."
Primark's representative said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August in Folkestone.
All the products in question have been removed from the sale."
This allows you to defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to the Krav Mageder of the Federation's Grand Master Rhon Mizrach, who lives in New York, to find out how to deal with gun-scraping robberies in close proximity.
You were then approached from behind or behind, this video shows how you can pay the attacker the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you're being approached behind you, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see your attacker and you're going to break the line of fire.
Then you'll grab the gun between the elbow and the shoulder before you hit the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue to push on the knee, and when the attacker goes out of pain, pull a gun from his hand, punch him in the face at the bottom of the gun, and take the gun against him.
If the armed person approaches the front, the technology is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, tap and turn it around so that the offender cannot launch.
At the same time put the weight on the gun and hit the attacker's chest, then pull the gun off his grip, back him up and point him with a gun.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video about how Mizrach does this exactly.
But remember, if you're not the boss of Krav Maga, the safest way out of the robbery is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright is licking the dirtiest places in Europe for the guide
The British traveler has put a serious challenge on his immune system and in its vomiting reflexes by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and night-olding places.
Ian Wright, 51, a guide from Suffolk, and a traveler, Ian Wright, 51, licked the euro banknotes, the pendulum in Piccadilly Circle, the WC on the train and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of their immune system.
Before licking every target, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was going to.
However, the experiment made with a film called Internal Power produced surprising results.
The idea of licking a smile tag used by thousands of people may seem completely hostile, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his way through Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about the confirmation of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his arrows left him in the mouth of another bad taste.
Wright became a well - known tester of the sustainability of his bowels when he traveled all over the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This mission from the public railway station to the wc seat’s air-conditioning license did indeed test his immune system.
In the film he said, "From the beginning I have been rather anxious about my health, and I have put all kinds of things in my mouth from the dust, the worms and the water."
He certainly confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample included more than 4,000 units per photometer.
Due to comparison, the read-up arm should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public visit, he refused to lick when the result of the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the opposite hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler’s film, the inner strength, together with a Finnish makeup, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtyer than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because there's something to sleep around here.
After internal power, it was produced together with Finnish makeup, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D that help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and immune systems.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of the intermediates, juices and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and which would explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas in the air, and we ended up with the idea "Let's call lan."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell us about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary film we can make it interesting to tell consumers more about it.
I also think the documentary shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The documentary director Tom Hakala added: "Let's say this, even if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him for, as I would have lost my respect for the Russians in the movie."
Clearly, some of the embarrassing things were easier for Ian, while the part was rather fragile.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows taken."
In the 2015 selection questionnaire 84% of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58% said that they at least occasionally used products that have been added to the lactic acid bacteria.
The family destroyed the rental house in Cornwall Saltash before the decision.
The oil family caused damage to their rental house 50 000 pounds after they were vandalized due to the terroristisation of neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Cornwall Saltash since they had been complained several times.
Once they had been removed from the property, the shocked housing company employees said the property was in a bad condition.
The walls were made with amber openings, the floorboards were torn, the waste was spread on the floor and the walls were mutilated with graffiti.
The family has now moved away, and they are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, host of Cornwall Houston, said that she was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said, "This has been a real nightmare for residents, and I do not think people should have to live like this.
There are many things to consider here, because this property is likely to be known through the less comfortable groups of Cornwall.
This family is bad news, and their name is bad."
The couple had three boys who lived between the property, and according to the police, the family's intimidation had a street fight in baseball games, the scare of the nearby residents, the use of drugs, the sale of drugs, and the excessive screaming, quarreling and curse.
In June, the 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was in the lease agreement, received a decision on social behaviour.
Many of the rooms of the house under the tank were found with old waste.
The property, from which drugs were previously transmitted, the floorboards were pulled up.
The neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police were called regularly.
Cornwall Houston was evicted by the force of the property of a woman and this partner this week, after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks, time to change voluntarily.
The simplified neighbors thanked the decision to say that their lives had become one hell of a living.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived as their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here incredibly many times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet in here we didn't get used to it!
It's wonderful, now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, Executive Director of Cornwall Houston, said that the family did not cooperate with the local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the property.
The garbage and old toys have been thrown down on the wildest wall in the rental house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her conduct, since the decision is always the last course considered by Cornwall Houston.
This was a very difficult case, for behavior was extreme, and their actions must have horrified neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall and the members of the community that have informed us.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that the antisocial use will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in twenty.
After the wedding, dirty mattresses left on the floor of one bedroom
The housing company's employees now have to clean up the dumpsters around the house.
In 2014, the police made a raid in the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis and wax, supplies and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skkeldon was fined for possession of a class B drug with a intention to distribute it forward.
He claimed that the money was intended for his son Lee Skeldon's tombstone, which died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner are living homeless after they stay in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the rooms in the house were covered with graffiti.
The police say they're trying to vanquish the residents who mock the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police said that the decision was a clear warning to other tenants who would continue to make fun of the rules.
"This is a message to those who think that their conduct is without sanctions, and to those who suffer from such behavior," he said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue working with their partners to protect our communities.
Travelers in Portugal horrified when a military jet flew down the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal, caused the shock of their lives
A Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane would wipe past really low
Air force said it was a training flight and claimed safety was not compromised.
The tourists who were stunned at the moment began to panic when a low - flying jet was tossing across a filled beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft became almost full of contact with solar ministers in the North Portugal Aveiro.
They stood up when they clearly began to worry about the noises of the jet machine, even though they did not see at first what was coming from behind the clouds.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova, near Aveiro last afternoon.
One of the numerous holidayers who published videos of dramatic bypass in social media was Daniel Fernandos, who said, "It passed twice really low, and one point seemed to be falling into the ground."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing, and it really felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach at Aveiro were horrified when the plane appeared out of darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Forces said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low that it was the only way to check boats.
He said that the jet had flown considerably lower than usual due to the bad visibility of the smoke from nearby gastropods, but the air force assured me that no one was in danger.
This summer, land fires have destroyed parts of the mainland Portugal, and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
Today, the Portuguese Air Forces said that the pilot had to fly due to the conditions of low visibility, the smoke caused by the gastropods and the thick fog.
The flight was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels.
The result of the first half of the year is better than expected.
In January - June, the social and health border (Eksote) in South Karelia produced a better result of EUR 3.4 million planned.
The result of the exposition was EUR 4.3 million in surplus during the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good for family and social services, where preventive services have been able to break down institutional care by developing them.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, the exotte seeks to shorten the series of measures.
The exit covers the deficit previously created.
The remaining proportion may be used to shorten lines and buy measures for patients.
The result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned for the whole year.
The exotte government will discuss a half-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
Immola took 70 special border guards to swear on the military election.
Of the 70 backup officers at the Border and Marine Guard School, they took a vow on Friday of the military election.
The military election of emergency officers at the Border and Maritime Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th special border ice-circuit lighting event was held in the reserve sports field.
The military whale swore on 70 backups.
Special border guards are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were applying for special border guards.
They were invited to the selection tests at 250.
Special border managers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five times during the war, the veterans of the border forces were involved.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who took part in the event were born in 1918.
A limit of rusty ahead of the crime investigation helps to find out the crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Every 11 police agencies in Finland has been an RTA intelligence and analysis unit since the beginning of 2014.
The operation of the unit is outright invisible.
A total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna are members of the Hämeenlinna police department.
It's pulled by Bay's invested sergeant.
He's the lead officer in Lahti, Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian suit.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and need, considers Deputy Police Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various investigations to other police officers.
Among other things, it has acquired information from asylum seekers.
Reform of the most recent working methods
The establishment of analytical units is a reform of the latest police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. the fact that the police are leaving more and more often, not until they get an alarm.
The information collected and analysed by the unit will target daily police activities where they are most needed.
As part of the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established, less than three national units, and each police station has its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR Centre in central criminal police, which is operating in Vantaa, is conducting national activities.
PTR units work under the name of the police, Customs and Border Guard Agency.
RTA units, for their part, work in police-based areas, and it is their duty to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond its territory
Where a single police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to the RTA unit to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the limits of its own institution, because that is what crime does.
Those working in the RTA unit have a better knowledge of basic police.
The Unit shall endeavour to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes through registers, alert databases and observations.
This is called "sale", and it is one of the most important tools of criminal investigation.
Everyone has their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the method of making, the author is a certain kind of image.
It may be done on the basis of an act or person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Errors
The RTA unit’s employees do not carry the collars of the city, but their work is not fully public.
Neither own nor the methods used by criminals are reported, because it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to prevent police crime-fighting companies.
The police will publicly report the treatment if it is expected to pose a threat.
For example, this was the case of early summer news, the concept of the labelling of empty dwellings used in housing fractures.
In it, the factors put an apartment in the outer door stick, a double needle or a tapeboard with which they tried whether the residents were really traveling.
The reference material shall be public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals are learning about their mistakes.
The smartest order is the protocol of the court, which may, for example, show that fingerprints have been found in the place.
Next time, we're gonna go to the thieves with our gloves on.
For the purposes of this case, Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppista Hämee Police Officer, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Police Department in Eastern Finland, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärve from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomala from Central Crime Police.
The police will collect and analyse information that will help plan practical action.
In the context of the reduction in labour and financial resources.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was a three-stage PORA reform which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of your own institution and Finland.
A schoolgirl who joined the father in London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British students who left London last year to join Isis, is said to have died in Syria.
Agent Tasime Akunjee said that the girl's family heard this dead in Syria Raqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that she was believed dead in a Russian air strike in Raqa, a base for organization in the country.
Sultan was 17 years old and, according to his family, he died just when he was planning to escape the war from tearing the country and returning to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a tombstone and as a will to others that there are real risks to going to the war area - that it could allow people to give up such a decision," Akkujee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other Eastern schoolgirls flew to Turkey, where they took the bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she had been married to Isis Fighter in Syria and that she became a widow only after a few months.
Reid says Clinton considers Garland the Supreme Court as a candidate if he is elected
According to the Senate Democratic Director Harry Reid, he is convinced that President Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland as President if he is elected President.
The Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Mitch McConnell, leader of the Senate majority, says that the next president will choose to replace Antonin Scalia, the senior court member.
Reid said at the phone conference on Thursday that he would predict "a degree of certainty" of Clinton's choice of Garland.
Later, Reid’s representative said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about the name of Garland and that it was a speculation.
He commended Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "take the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans who stop Garland's name are the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "handlers" and "perfectors".
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treats says that the naked calendar is for women as well as for men.
Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pierre of the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they intend to find their next peak generation 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Mr. Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his leaves with a lot of naked images are different from Playboy in the old school because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them, too.
"We must begin to present the timeless and classical nakedness where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired with these pictures of naked women's bodies," Shaw said in the press release of the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful art.
Models can leave images via the network or personally in open selections in Los Angeles and New York.
The destination of Vinyl: Who actually buys records?
Single, middle-aged men love rifles.
Before you start to fill the comment with the infringements with the label NoAllInfantry Men, note that this argument is based on real information.
According to YouGov, the new appearance of a lot of recorded albums is not due to the fact that more and more people born in this millennium are excited about the refurbishment of physical objects, but about the appeal of the Middle Ages.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl plate are most likely to be 45-54 years old.
In fact, most likely, all are buying albums in the age group of 18-24-year-olds.
Moreover, it is not only a question of collecting professionals, but it includes a sign: older suppliers of vinyls are slightly more likely to keep their feelings within themselves (56% vs 53%) and enjoy their loneliness (69% vs 66%).
But is YourGov's results true?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me while I'm in the middle of a busy street in Soho, I'd be wearing a slight gray suit. I'd be very busy before I stopped, I'd make a cup of my hands, and I'd say something authoritative, like, "Let's look in more detail."
Let us look into it more closely.
At the same time, when Soho's charm and dirt are slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and stores, and office supplies are now filled with buildings where there were previously independent movements - there are still a bunch of magnificent, specialized record stores.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment when I stand very close to a variety of men in some of these shops trying to assess their age and their emotional heritage.
Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (number: two young women, three middle-aged men) Reckles Records ( counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably twenty), spend their afternoon in London due to a meeting, and tours shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"Always I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These sheets, which appear in the picture above (and sent a sample by email, did not follow him home), cover his living room walls.
The reason for such a huge amount of disk and singles is partly the result of his available revenues: now he can buy records he couldn't afford when they were originally published, and he can buy again those he sold when he was young and free of money.
"A large part of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early 70s, records published when there were 11 or 12, which I probably was a little too young to get," he says.
He agrees that the buyers of discs are more likely to be introverts that enjoy their own company, and adds: "I do not smoke nor drink much.
This is my bad."
The 25-year-old Wez, who works in Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounter fit your Goov profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people affected by the enthusiasm of the media. People who have heard that the albums have come back into fashion and have come to need to buy their old albums back.
Based on my discussions, people have been able to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sell their vinyls to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their albums back," he says.
This can explain the increase in the number of certain age vinyl nerves.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of the albums?
In a trade like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer comfort to the same types of community.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the close payment system.
Some vinyl fans can become confused with the digital world and choose to rely on the perpetuity of familiar record files; objects that raise memories of teen days of happiness.
"I think that sometimes it may be about filling the hole or some kind of comfort that wez has to own", says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true to many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
"We are like their social workers!" the second employee suddenly said from the record.
The opinion taken by the April ICM revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought a vinyl plate during the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% of them have a record player that they never use, while 7% of them do not have a record player.
Here, the news report is likely to appear to be a serious concern on my back with the stack of bossa nova collections.
This "wine" perspective is something that also works in Sounds of the Universe (the figure: three middle-aged men) Jonny, 42, has noticed.
"Somebody came in a while ago and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead album so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a big deal, but this is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So, not parents, but younger people, late-nights, who are just getting excited about it.
At the top, where almost a full layer has been booked to the Vinyles today, there is a much more diverse audience upon arrival.
Seven decades of ducks, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previous movements, it's great to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem to be lonely, but it is difficult to prove a pale psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Flipp for a few minutes, watching the various discs on sale.
He's making window purchases, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make a lot of money, so there's really no alternative to record collection.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is..." he cares about falling in love.
"I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have raised a new generation of vinyl thinners: Urban Outfitters.
At the same time, I'm trying to find out that I'm looking at a group of young girls who are gathering around the Pollaroid cameras for a moment before my father and daughter think about buying Crosley's record player.
On the left there is a portal with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac album cover: a mix of modern music and classics, any central collection of essential records.
No one looks at them, perhaps because they're just decorations, and some are so high that it's impossible to touch them.
It's purely "artvinyls".
However, given that the small attention received by these items can mean more money for industry and send some customers to Soho's cancers for more, there is not much to complain about.
There is no surprise that the population with more time and money than others is also the one who uses the most luxurys, such as vinyls.
But even though my findings suggest that youGoov's results are accurate at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers who exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or office.
They certainly don't spend Thursday mornings painting record stores around Berwick Street while wearing record sheets and avoiding a creepy, 30-year-old artificial television driver's view of this in the throat over the shoulders of men of unwitting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the most distant vertebral animal - video report
Scientists say that the hokers have a longer life than any other planet on the back of the planet.
According to Julius Nielsen who studied sharks, the record is a female whose age is believed to be between 272 and 512 years and is five metres long.
The French court rejects the application to break off the trades from the Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected the application of the Calais authorities to break down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants from the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In the proceedings this week, the Calais authorities explained that the state should be able to decompose all 72 temporary trades, where people sell goods from cigarettes within the camp to energy drinks, offer hair surgery or sell tea at 50 cents (40 pences) or sell simple food with a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect's Office justified that the premises should be removed because they represent a tax-free parallel economy and are at risk of fire and clean-up.
The humanitarian groups have told the Court that trades and restaurants are vital, in other words, the free meals offered by the organisation supported by the state and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They justified that temporary trades and restaurants often offer protection and free meals for those who need them.
The Court of Justice in Lille stated that there were no legal grounds for evicting 72 people in temporary trade, but said that Calais' prefect's concern "was completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than feeding people living in the "highly uncertain" conditions.
He said that the facilities offered peaceful appointments to refugees and volunteers.
One of the places below the depot was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, whose activity is unprofitable and which offers 200 meals daily, English and French lessons, as well as asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors.
Over 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect children's cafe.
The letter sent to Guardian said that closing the cafe would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Aumberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle's camp has risen to 9000 people - to peak reading - since the number of arrivals rose steeply during the summer.
Food prices fall much faster in Finland than on average in the EU
Food in Finland is much reduced to the joy of consumers and to the harm of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly 5% in three years, as its average price fell by 0.9% in the EU.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one percent more expensive.
Over the last three years, food prices have fallen most in Finland from the EU countries with the same wage level as Finland.
From the comparative countries only in Britain, food prices have fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are reflected in the Ilkka Lehtinen article by Statistics Finland Development Manager, which was published in the Information & Trendit blog.
The newspaper compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportionate to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June of this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation had to be alarmed.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed the turn, after which food had become cheaper a year.
The import bans imposed by Russia on food, which have made food exports from Finland to Russia, are now at a price.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Puint's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in a short term," says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition in industry and trade has also affected the fall in prices.
The large chains of trade S Group and Kesko have both decreased their prices.
The consumer’s price competition has been seen as the most spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not the type of low-cost food, even though food prices have fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland in EU countries with a similar level of pay as in Finland.
According to the newspaper, VAT is significantly affected by the price of food sold in Finland.
He found that if the analogue countries had the same VAT rate, the third lowest food would be sold in Finland from the same level of pay.
The newspaper compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the Veroque countries, only Germans and Dutch people would sell more affordable food than Finns.
"If we want to get to the EU's level at food prices, we must cut VAT on average in the EU and continue the price competition", Lehtinen writes.
The page notes that the calculations he made are indicative of VAT percentages.
The school isn't exactly the same anymore.
Returning to school can be seen as a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum for schools has been developed, which will be put in place at the beginning of the academic year in all primary schools.
It is a guide for all schools in Finland to operate.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and are different from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of beauty is abandoned, and schools instead start to practice coding.
The Swedish rate is already beginning in the sixth grade, and social education is already being read in the fourth grade.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of students.
Before it was thought that the teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from one another.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
The world's most long-lasting vertebrates have been found - icefish can live for up to 400 years
The known Greenland halibut (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches maturity at the age of 150.
It can live after 250 years, report new research.
The figures make the species the most long-lasting spine in the modern world.
In the animal, it is only passed by the Islamic frog, whose oldest known individual has been scheduled to be 507.
The Greenland shark swims down the North Atlantic.
They also have a second record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females are stretching dogs longer, they can grow up to five metres.
Since the rate of growth is slow, only about a centimetre a year according to the monitoring, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen, from the University of Copenhagen, and with his colleagues, found out.
He identified the ice sharks of adults from 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed by the radio-carbonisation of eye lenses.
The average age of the investigated sharks proved to be at least 272 years.
Two of the biggest fish in the sample, 493- and 502-cent amass, appeared to be about 335 and 392 years of age.
As past studies have shown that icebergs are only more than four metres of maturity, researchers calculated that they are about 150 years of age at that stage.
Science published by the research.
You're fired from Stockmann for almost 300, and you're not reduced to sales.
Almost 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann.
Cooperative companies in a company that was in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"The result of these matches is that about 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made as dismissals," Stockmann explains in its communication.
It states that the number of sellers in the goods sector will not be reduced so that the customer service does not suffer.
In addition, some 80 employees of support activities are offered new jobs as a seller.
The Stockmann ytt negotiations concerned some 3,000 employees.
At the beginning of these reductions, it was estimated that there were about 380 employees.
The reduction of the population aims at an annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which will be achieved next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme aimed at achieving savings of EUR 50 million this year.
In the background, Stockmann's difficulties are to make the trade profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11,1 million in the second quarter, trade in goods is still losing.
For Stockmann, according to the CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in commodity stores have not reached the goals set by the company.
"Immigrant reductions are, unfortunately, necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018", says Veijalainen.
The result improvement of the second quarter was mainly due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
Ketju achieved the best sales and results of the second quarter of all time.
The operating profit of Lindex grew by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the total operating result of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year are falling last year.
The operating result of the cut-off is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature below 20 degrees across the country
The low pressure center on the north of Finland keeps the weather rainy Friday, says the meteorologist Ilona Láng of HS.
In the middle of the earth, there will also be rainforests, but the south is the harlot.
The temperature is no longer very summer, as mercury remains below 20 degrees throughout the country.
In northern rain areas, you stay at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya’s General Sports Team shakes dopingscandal - a strange explanation of the coach’s pace
Kenian sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah was a team athlete at the doping test.
The news agency AP told us that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is 800 meters from the star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's land-based team, told me that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a surprise test in Rotichina.
Doping officials came to report to the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home, for he "became off to Kenya's country team".
He played as a athlete, gave me a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept this kind of use", Chairman of the Kenya Olympics Committee Kip Keino, in turn, made a strong effort to reuters the news office.
The Olympics’ general sports begins on Friday, and Rotichin is supposed to run at that moment.
It is not yet known whether the driver is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich settled last year at the World Championships on the way fourth and has pre-meditated Rio winner discounts.
According to Reuters, the source within Kenya’s General Sports Team claimed that Anzrah went through the athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the racing hall.
When the anti-doping officers met him, they assumed he was a athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to officials because he was afraid he'd be exposed," the source told.
Where is everybody?
Rio’s General Sports Stadium’s void
Where is everybody?
At the Rio Olympic Stadium, at least they don't have any public sports.
In Rio started a struggle on public sports medals on Friday, but the world’s top figures were able to present their skills to an unscrupulous empty viewer.
Rio’s organisers on Friday reported that only 58% of the first day’s morning tickets and 65% of the overnight tickets have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium bullied out of a cheering crowd.
The flags of the finals have already come to an end in Rio.
The Rio Olympic Games have already attracted attention to the sport.
For example, thousands of empty blades have been seen in the sights of rugby, melon, and horse riding.
When Brazil’s mitalitivos Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copabana, only 70 percent of the viewer’s house was full.
After Brazil’s two, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30% of the 12 000 people’s view was full.
At least bad moves explain the fact that Brazil is a long way from fighting economic difficulties to European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympics are strange to the Brazilians who were used to football.
Although even the Brazilian football team, the first match could not have been drawn to the football stadium.
During the weekend, the informant Mario Andrada said that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said after Reuters.
8,2 million tickets for the Olympics in London were sold, although almost half of the total value of tickets was higher than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around EUR 9 to more than EUR 1 000.
More than half the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and army staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Rio because organisers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organisers have given 240 000 tickets to less known species in the school world, such as golf and rugby.
At the Rio stadium, there were empty places this morning.
Not even the beach volleyball in Copaca has been interested in the audience.
Jukka Centralo competed in London in 2012.
All right, I'm done with people on leafy feet.
A new way to protect nature - acquire the right to land
Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
The Foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant habitats.
After that, private, companies and entities can use money to redeem ownership rights in the country.
The foundation has acquired its first land in the region of Lap.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks that will be able to obtain a right of ownership against payment.
The administrator receives 187 square blocks of veto, which in practice means that each holder is not required to be approved if the use of the land is to be modified.
Management rights can also be acquired for several areas.
Acquiring the right to administration is something concrete that can be left for inheritance or given as a gift.
There is no need to go to carry the banderolones or stick yourself to something to protect nature," says Juha Levovakah, who acquired the right of control for his company.
The acquirer of the administrative right receives precise location information from his block, which allows, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the names of the holders of the right-holder’s rights are displayed on the same map from which the parcel data can be found.
The stone fabric sees its nature protection project as a risk only that the Foundation’s activities will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been set up as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation will somehow act in an ethical or commercial manner, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Haltija project is the protection of habitats so that they can remain intact and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land by buying or donation.
It mainly finances the sale of ownership rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The aim of the Foundation is to obtain more protection countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to move from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Chamber of Commerce on 13-19 August.
The bike thieves torture the big cities, the worst in Turkey - look at the situation in your municipality.
Cycling thieves torture Turkey from Finland's big cities.
This year, more wheels have been stolen in proportion to the number of inhabitants than in nine other major cities.
In the light of the bike thefts reported to the police, the number of bicycles and parts of them were stolen in the 10 largest cities in January to August of this year, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose.
According to police records, there were four out of five bike thefts per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, only about two bike thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities, double thefts are carried out in proportion to the number of inhabitants," characterises the police officer Tommi Reen.
Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more spins have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The generality of opinion can influence how much the city is moving around and how much the wheel is on top of it", says Sergeant Teemu Aikas.
The Tommi Reen of the Police Government is looking forward to the rise in Turku, Helsinki and Oulu.
The number of bike thefts goes much depending on the number of study and cycling cities.
Turku has a large centre, short distances and a lot of wheels for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different kind of city, where city centres are distant and the bicycle is not necessarily a primary means of movement," Reen says.
Throughout Finland, police have become slightly less bike thefts in January to August than in the corresponding period of last year.
Yet there is no cause for joy.
Despite the landing trend of recent years, a little over 20,000 bike thefts will be reported by the police every year.
It means 50-60 Fillars every day and only in Helsinki 4 000 wheels per year.
"They're big amounts," Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more wheels, as only a part of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to make a report on the theft of a bike, even less frequently than every 10 cases reported to the police.
The type of solved bike theft is the kind where the police get information about theft immediately and the thief is caught in blood.
"There will also be other cases in the course of the investigation when, for example, there may be stolen wheels in the drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, cyclists are caught on a weekly basis by themselves in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
He said that wheels would be stolen, for example, from wheelchairs, inner courtyards, warehouses and wheelchairs, in practice, wherever they are normally stored.
Most of the individual bike models are stolen in the same way as the previous years.
The U-lock will give the wheel a better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the wheel, for example, for their own use, but much of the stolen wheels end up selling, for example, via the Internet.
They're going to stay on the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the police that stolen wheels would go much abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finnish.
Some buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of the wheel used must be very careful, for he can commit an offence or a violation.
"The alarm clocks should be played if the decent bikes are sold to their clear bottoms," Reen says.
Special Library official Severi Hirvi wears his colorful Nops for his working day to protect the Kallion Library in Helsinki.
He's had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen, Hirovi tells us. "It's never been taken, there's been a good monk."
Perhaps this does not attract thieves, this may not have hipster value," Hirvi, Helsinki, is thinking.
In the Kiosk located in Kallio, Helsinki, Siiri Valve locked his bicycle in a small u-lock.
Now the wheel was up against the wall, but generally Valve locks his bike in a solid, like a bike.
"There is a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I've ever owned," says the Helsinki student on her white bike, whose body cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time you hear from your buddies that the wheel has been taken."
"Mostly bad spins, such scum-Joys."
On the watch, a bike was stolen from the inside of the house company a year ago.
But the wheel had not been locked, so Valve was able to wait for it to be hanged.
Less than 15 years of age responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-lighting teams known to the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-review team is trying to prevent young people from getting into the crime cycle.
At first, the experiment will apply to persons under 15 who are now without criminal liability.
There's no blood power for the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer-review team will discuss and impose sanctions with the perpetrator.
A week later, the perpetrator can join the peerlight team to make up for his actions.
For example, there may be a letter written to the family explaining what has become and what has been learned about it.
Chief of Youth, Tommi Laitoto says that the model is not tight.
We also have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
"All men are guided in a more responsible direction so that everything does not ruin the first mistake," says Laitio.
A model has been drawn from the United States of America, where it is widely used.
The idea is that young people, not after their first crimes, will be exposed to an adult panel, only reflected with those of the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service design agency that followed the experiment, Palmu’s service designer, Iikka Lovio, tells us that this was an assault that was successfully resolved.
Especially those under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to keep going on the road you've chosen," Lovio says.
The peer-responsible team is part of the Helsinki project of the Finnish Immigration Service, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new practices are offered to all, not only to immigrant parents.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
From the letter, the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received a draft from it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
They want the party's money to be channelled to the congresses instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his inadmissibility, inaccuracy and record-like unfavorations, threaten to bring these elections to the Democrats a sounding circle," says Politico.
Only to direct all the possible resources to Congress can the Republicans be prevented from falling into the Trump anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election will be reduced by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organised the letter is apparently Trump's opposing Republic, Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress, and that it is not the support of anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump, which are believed to have broken millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials who worked on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trumpi as president.
Clinton promises relief for American families with children.
In the United States, the democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told us about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be President-in-Office so that the U.S. economy can do well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to become president so that the economy can do well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive, $75 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part by rich tax increases, partly by private money.
The construction program is a hand-held service for the American duunars who suffer from the shift of factories to cheap labor countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in good paid jobs after World War II.
We are the builder, we must return to construction!
Clinton said.
On Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday he also heard Sanders stressing that the rich should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if the company goes from the United States to a tax burden, it must pay the income tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"As President, I am opposed to all trade agreements that work against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published before Clinton spoke the Washington Post magazine, Clinton was going to criticise the economic program published by Republicans Donald Trump on Monday, saying that it "supervised only millionaires like this".
Trump's proposed reduction in corporate taxes, Clinton, has previously called "Trump's loopholes".
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small businesswoman.
He reminded hearers of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has not paid, and of the clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start making himself products in America", Clinton was hiding.
Such are Rio’s viewer figures: Cats have not glued Finnish around the screens, but they are interested in mobile applications
Usually, sports fairs appear in TV’s viewer statistics as sharpst mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympic Games have so far not reached peak ratings.
At the same time, 12 per cent of the population are attached to the screens: Tuesday night swims followed by Ylen from the Olympics TV2 at the same time 615 000 viewers.
Due to the comparison: the EM events of the month ago received almost 800 000 viewers at TV2, and the EMs in football were quite another million.
The most interested of the Olympic species have so far been biking on Sunday nights, and the fifth day of the race, the gymnasty, which both reached the Olympics at one time nearly half a million viewers.
Yle Sport Manager Panu Pokinen is pleased with the number of viewers, and reminds us that the audiences are divided into several different instruments for the first time in Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Areena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers choose the Olympic Games at all.
On the side of the television, viewers share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports parties Yle has dedicated a whole channel to.
When the shipment arrives 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500 000, it is a good base.
The number of viewers is smaller than in the 2012 London competitions or the 2008 Beijing competitions, but the difference will explain the time difference - a large part of Rio’s tours will be in Finland during the night.
Another reason for a flat interest - if someone thinks it's thin - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken the first competition on a surprise medal, the interest would have been uphill with it.
In addition, sport is just beginning, as are other Finnish interesting species: sailing and horse riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of viewers at the beginning has been close to the expected number.
When public sports begins, the ratings will explode.
Yle lanseere for the competitions for Yle Rio 2016, which in the first days of the competitions rose to Apple’s App Store for the most downloadable application in Finland.
By Monday, the application was loaded 150,000 times.
I'd guess we're already going to 200 000 downloads.
"The numbers of the viewers of the blood will not be until later," says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not worked for all users, hopefully.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has arrived and the flaws have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been accompanied by a delay and other minor technical problems at the initial stage.
The applications have received updated versions which should correct errors.
The Rio Olympics appear on the Ylen channel and in the arena more widely than any other sports event ever before.
Yle Fem can track some species, and on the radio Yle Tele can pass the races daily.
The Olympics are perhaps the most laborers to Yle ever, including the last ones that can only be traced from Yle's channels.
From 2018 the Olympics can be seen both on Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is the Deepest Lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, Finland's deepest lake is your sun, which has a depth of 95.3 meters on the Crossback.
It could be deeper.
The technical service teacher Matti Kannela found a pressure of about 20 square meters from the Crossside, which was built in depth by a dive computer of 104 meters.
In summer 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre tried to make no effort to strengthen the findings by persuading.
The method does not necessarily find a small depth of 100 metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 m.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 m) and Suvasvesi (90 m).
Over 80 meters goes to Saimaa, Toishves and Lake Head.
They have not been studied as closely as the Sun.
Especially the base of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"It could well be found in unknown depths," Kannela thinks.
If the deep lake is determined using medium depth, it is the Great Lake Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
In this way, your sun will not enter the ten deepest crowds, and Suvasvesi will be further away from the tip.
Correction on August 12 at 14.29: The corrected last piece, where the deepest lakes were wrong.
Low tax sector: Animal taxation is still more intense
Pension taxation is still more intense than wage earners.
The citizen says that the situation was raised under parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was allowed to be equal to the employees.
This is not included in the Board's presentation.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be maintained after the election, he says to West Media.
At the beginning of this year, employees received job income reductions that reduced taxation.
The case was raised in the Parliament by representatives of the opposition, who were polishing the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (Kok.) of the electoral promises.
The purchasing power is secured, it's not growing.
According to Ihalainen, tax reductions are mainly about safeguarding and increasing purchasing power, as next year no increase will be made.
He says that tax reductions have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other issues do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Orpo's message with the desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached at the time of trouble.
He says that it is important to stick to the treaty in order to be credible.
It is the most important economic and employment policy activity of the Government.
It has been done with the power of social partners, so it must not be questioned.
It will be necessary because the economy is so much in the hands of domestic demand and people's own future faith.
Contamination of long-term unemployment in a dispute
A person calls on the government to address long-term unemployment in the budget dispute, at least to stop it from growing.
In June, long-term unemployed were about 17 000 more than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's goal of rising the employment rate to 72% is to escape.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline in the promise.
Ambassador: Finnish victims are not known for the attacks in Thailand
In the bombings that took place last night and last night in Thailand, at least four people died.
The Embassy calls on the Finnish authorities to take care of their country and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns who intend to be in Thailand to withdraw their journey because of explosives, but it is important to follow the instructions of the embassy with caution, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are very few Finns in Thailand at the moment, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish Thai travel period is scheduled for the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to target the Finns in Hua Hin in particular to find out about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
In general, everything seems to be fine, says Westphalen.
No data on the author
Westphalen says there's no evidence of a hit-in yet.
The Ambassador believes that events may relate to the political rest of the Thai divided society and the last week's referendum on the Constitution drawn up by military junta.
The law was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who said they were against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic conflict related to the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
The Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, earlier attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
There's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
He says the city celebrates Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very limited.
The attacks affect the day's course of action so that the authorities are very precise in terms of safety.
Thai Police: This is not an international terrorist attack.
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from normal terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also excluded, says Thai police according to the AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died in 24 hours, when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
Even the Finns' favorite tourist destination, the holiday island in Phuket blew up four bombs at night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require death victims.
Two of the bombs exploded in the paper, and they say it's inpong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where according to the magazine one person was wounded.
In the popular tourist destination, Hua Hin, according to local authorities, has blown up a total of four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one died in either double-bomb attack.
In addition, in South Thailand, Surat Thani village, and in the city of Trang, at least one bomb exploded.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also known to many tourists, as it is carried to Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao's holiday island.
There is no known cause of the tumours
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the ruling military junta in Thailand is not yet known.
Bombs are trying to create chaos and confusion.
We should not let people panic, he said to journalists.
According to Mr Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, the Prime Minister for Security, at least Hua Hin and Trang, is in contact with each other.
He told Thai BSB that the factors were intended to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls for the attention of Finnish residents in the country to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finns who intend to leave Thailand should not withdraw their journey because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions of caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Europeans affected
So far, very little is known about attacks and their victims during the Finnish night.
About last night's strike in Hua Hin has been able to get some more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded there are at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian.
In the latter attack of Hua Hin, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded near a clock tower known as a visible light.
Thai PBS tells us that the police have isolated Hua Hin from the area where she believes she has found another bomb.
Surading Than's bomb, according to the governor of the county, was hidden in a flower cap.
The municipal employee died in the hit.
There's at least one wounded.
CNN's interviewed chief of police tells us that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded about half an hour apart.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles won women's quadruple
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman was the second point 60.098 and Russia Alija Mustafina third with 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, still pursues telecommunications in Rio's race with permanno, jump and boom.
Biles has ruled the power of women in the past few years.
He has eight personal world stars from three previous seasons.
He has won three times in a row, and the last and the second year of the boom.
In the U.S. team, Biles has achieved two teams of world titles.
The darker MM-millions of Biles have jumps and booms.
Thai Finnish entrepreneurs: "The person has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Thailand's Phuket and children's playground in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I do not believe that this will result in anything more amazing, the assessment of Huovila, who has worked for some twenty years in Asia, as a Finnish company.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen a lot of tragedys near Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bomb strike in Bangkok.
If these have not been banished by tourists before, I don't think so.
Huovila's company's office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack on his own employee.
The employee called about nine local times and said you shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street Bangladesh Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the journeys were set for the queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere was calm and the main loss movement was allowed to open at about ten o’clock local time.
On the beach many had not even heard of the attacks.
Half the time in Thailand during the three days, the traffic was normalized and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila.
Later this car was seen in Krunnupy on the Jouxholmite.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The party found two men suitable for conscience marks hidden in a nearby tree.
The other man was captured right away.
The other one left, but later they found him in the woods using a police dog.
Men are suspected of using a motor vehicle, theft and serious damage.
The police are grateful for the clues.
Research Director on Russian leadership changes: Clear deportation
In Russia, the highest-valued leadership change was made on Friday in years when President Vladimir Putin removed his regime from Sergei Ivanov.
The successor of Ivanov is a 44-year-old Anton Vano.
He's an ex- diplomat, and he's been second-guessing Ivanov.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for the separation of Ivanov can be Putin's desire to prevent strong people from gathering too much power around him.
He adds that recycling management functions is one of the ways in which power is used.
This is a way of preventing people from begging for their own power independent of the President.
According to the Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in the handles with other executives or screwed up.
Arm fire in Ivanov
Ivanov, who is part of the Putin's internal border, moves to specific environmental and transport tasks.
By presenting the state media, Putin said that the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other duties and suggested that Hena be replaced, said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport matters are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian rule.
Furthermore, Ivanov has played an important role in the Security Council of the President.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin at the KGB.
He was deemed to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but becoming president of Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that old maps, such as governors, have recently been exchanged in Russia.
Senior researcher Kati Pynnóniem from the Foreign Policy Institute says that it is more interesting than the heir of Ivanov's place that Putin is to change its surroundings younger.
The Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when retreating from Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to flee to the city of Jarabulus, so that we do not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters received about 90% of the important Manbij city for Daddy.
However, it is estimated that there were tens of jihadites left in the city at that time.
Revised news at 7:30: We were wrong to tell you that civilians were running from town, actually the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled town.
Professor: The Ministry of Interior's Documentary Line is illegal
The line of the Ministry of Interior on the publicity of documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen says to the STT that the document can not be based on the Authority's own guidelines but is based on law.
Formerly, the Ministry of Interior refused to submit a list of participants to Ilta-Sanom at the meetings of the Minister of Interior.
The Minister justified the decision with the Government’s Office’s guidance and the fact that the information had been entered in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's Communication Director tells the STT that the Ministry has identified the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's Last Olympic Show starts in Rio
Like the last few years, Bolt has been running against time.
She hurt her way back from the early days and had to skip the Olympics in Jamaica.
This has not been the perfect preparation, but I'm in a much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
This press conference included low-end pillar dancers and fans.
In Porina Bolt, the bottom line is that the Jamaican star has risen during the period of public sports, struggling with doping scandals and a enchanting interest.
Bolt’s previous defeat at the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he escaped in the early 200 meters of time in 21.05.
At that time, the 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down your injuries and loose training positions.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred metres, where he crushed the world record and the self - confidence of competitors despite the time that was born in the final event of 9.69.
This is harder.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career at the lawpoint at the clock.
World records born in Berlin at 9,58 meters and 19,19 in two hundred are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced his pursuit of a 200-metre world record and 19-second underrun, but no one believes that it was born except Bolt himself.
At the 100th of Bolt, Athens 2004 is the 100th Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year in Beijing's MM-line, Bolt defeated the Americans with only one hundred-piece seconds.
In the course of his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost even during the finals of the prize competitions if only it has been possible.
In Däänu 2011, the 100th MM-line was left out of Bolt because of the lightning blast.
Bolt fills in plenty of weeks after 30.
He's an old man of young men, and Rio's race is his last Olympics.
In London, the final goal line of the career, Bolt has set the World Cup next year.
These are the Olympics who separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm in the subjects, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the interview with Sports Illustrated.
Shows about Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping offences
According to the Chinese National News Office, Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
There were traces of banned substances from Chen Xiny's doping sample.
The Bulgarian drinks, Silvia Danekova, are also suspected of a doping crime.
In addition, the Keni sports coach was posted to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of a athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given me a doping sample with signs of epo-hormon.
He was fourth in Rio at a women's 100-meter butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese maid has taken his doping case before the International Court of Appeal of Sport to the CAS.
Xinhua tells us that there have been evidence of a diuretics called hydrochlorothiazide from the Xiny on Sunday.
In Rio, other doping suspects have also appeared.
BBC reports that Bulgarian female cheeses Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
Kenia has, on the other hand, sent her home from Rio to the public sports coach because of the doping crime.
On Thursday, the International Olympics Committee KOK told us that the Kenyan coach had become a athlete in the test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, this is the Chinese fast-run coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used a thousand feet of Ferguson Rotich's race.
Phelps isn't gonna stop anything - historical gold came into the acting style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, the United States Michael Phelps swims 200 metres in a mix of 22nd Olympics in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympics already.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer of the same species in the fourth consecutive race.
Phelps's winning time was 1.54,66.
Kosuke Hagino, Japan, was placed in confusion second before Wang Shuni, China.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, Helen Skelton, the BBC Olympics, laughs at the newspaper's quick interview.
The case of Helen Skkelton (i.e.) on Monday is the most outstanding story of this week's newspaper website.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't have much stress if there's a small amount of noise in the sow or the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
It's a visual media, he insists.
Skkelton has been dressed in high-level shoes and shorts for at least enough exposure to at least a number of conservative British soldiers.
But there are no back steps.
It's important to look good, and the little talk is just a fun thing.
I'm sure Skkelton wants to scare me, and maybe he's a little bit upset, but he's insisting that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the trial has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that places attention to how hard these swimmers are doing and how big sacrifices they make is for me, Skkelto is agitating.
You know what?
It's all about nothing if it comes from wearing a driver.
I'm a little amused if someone's ever hit one of them.
The Rio police made two arrests for a terrorist attack.
On Thursday, Rio's police announced that they've arrested two people for a terrorist attack.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the race.
In the same connection, the police made five other arrests and questioned two people before they were released.
All the suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news page, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group that was arrested by the police in July.
The arrests are believed to have links with the Isis extremes.
Of course, the arresters had reduced violence in social media.
Messages that called for violence were disseminated, among other things, in the WhatsApp service.
The safety of Rio's race is equivalent to 85,000 police officers.
Police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their battles in an empty hall on the early block of the Rio basketball tournament on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and shut down the place from the audience.
The police let the public in after a controlled explosion of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympic Games when the police performed a controlled explosion mission.
The police shut down the arena because of the suspicious package they found there.
The audience got in after the police had controlledly blew up the package.
The audience did not record the viewer by the beginning of the match, because the police closed down the arena because of the suspicious package found in the arena.
The police blew up the package and released the public administration only after that.
The drink woke up the race to the Spanish team that began sleepily.
With two losses, the race started by Spain won Nigerian points 96-87.
In the previous two races, Spain reached silver.
For the third time during the summer race in Rio, the police performed a controlled explosion mission.
Last time, the police had to blow up a suspicious find in the vicinity of the road bike destination last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their battles in the early part of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty viewers.
The Argentinan lady stabbed Petija-Siren - a Finnish man was thinking about the protest
The Tuuli Petator-Siren had a colourful competition day in Rio.
The wind of Petija-Siren was hard on Thursday.
The Argentinian lady stabbed the Tuuli Petator-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the day of surfing women.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant gave me a breach.
He was caught because of the crash, and others ran away, the Finnish chief coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
The athlete considered the protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing so because it would have been useless according to the Olympics.
I should have dropped into the water so I could get credit, Petator-Siren said.
The Finnish hanger was hanging on his desk until the last time, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnishman was left with the crash instead of 27.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic Warhead Medal is eight.
In relation to the pain, the crash didn't seem very much.
Friday is an important day when you're racing 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petija-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, extend age
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years to the life of a person.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life is extended.
Sometimes things that cannot be affected by a person can bring him more years.
These include a tendency to medium body muscle or social status.
Regular shopping may extend your age.
You don't always have to sneeze, just to pick up the milk.
A long-term secret has been sought to resolve many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most strange research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drink of beer and coffee
Coffee drink has been found to protect from cancer, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
Research at Harvard University stated that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "low risk of death", particularly in terms of neurological or cardiac diseases.
On behalf of the alcohol again, there are studies that show that judicial use - one of three daily doses - may extend life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived as parents as people who did not drink at all.
The normal use of toothpaste can extend the life of a person even by more than six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents infections.
On the other hand, they can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases in other parts of the human body.
The study carried out in Norway explained how laughing had an impact on human life.
Over 55,000 people were monitored by the project that lasted seven years.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when sexual protection is taken into account, is good for health according to many studies.
In addition to everything, it can also extend your age.
Unfortunately, it's just not enough to have sex as it is.
In order for a person to have more years of his life, he should also receive orgasm.
Mobility will, of course, bring additional years, it will not be contested.
However, reaching a long-term age does not require absolute sovereignty.
One study at Oxford University found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
Their bodies also had more omega 3 fatty acids.
The same study connected these aspects to lower mortality.
Whether it was a athlete or Oscar who won the Olympics, he is more likely to live longer than the usual bull.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation can be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring his life to more years.
Some researchers doubt that a long-term age is the result of a person's social status, which, for example, contributes to the pursuit of recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping practices for people over 65 years of age found that a person shopping daily, i.e. probably a parent who makes shopping less often.
This is because rounding in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may trigger death.
So count the credit card from your hand... online shopping is not the same.
The dead-human race went down towards the truck
There was a serious truck and passenger car in Koske on Friday night.
The accident occurred at Koske, between Kostken and Sorvaston on Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving towards Forssa, when the passenger car received was on the same track, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck went down after the crash, and it's on it, but it's on fire.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car went down and over and over and over again on the roof.
A woman who was born in 1972 who was driving a passenger car was bitten by her car.
The rescue facility removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Hospital.
The result of a female blow test was 2.22 prommel.
He's suspected of being in a serious race.
The mail sent loose candy to the wrong city.
There were deficiencies in the selection of Salon K-Citymarket’s bulk box, since the mail had delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki by mistake.
Teija Haltia, who lives in the family, was on Thursday to buy loose candy from Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign came to my eye.
Unfortunately, there are product shortages in the raccoon because the Post delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when the Post gets delivered!
So, if you don't rub in the lawnmower, it's on the sign.
The merchant’s sticky sign relates to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to cover grass-cracking.
The grass can be found in the Post's offer until the end of August.
Haltia felt that the sign was mainly fun and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update hit me with an abyss.
The media has also been calling all along, and the attention raised by this is amazing, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, the update of Haltia had over 700 divisions on Facebook.
Haltia got her favorites caught in a plastic bag, even though a few of them were empty.
Jaakko Kaadeno, responsible for the business of the Transport Services of Post Enterprises, was sorry for the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stage were deported to the wrong place (Sinajoki) yesterday, and we no longer went to do a partial delivery (Saloon) on three, but we only took five stage today, and Kadesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
It's the first time I've heard of it. It's the first time I've ever heard of it.
The girl Haltia didn't get nervous about the sign because she found all her own loose-eyed scarves in the range.
Very thinning! 30 kilos lightened Lotta Backlund published a photo of his change
A comedian producer has spent tens of pounds after the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of a change in life.
Lotta shared the photo pair's change on Friday in Instagram.
In the spring, Loto was in the gym, and he was looking for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Koomakoko, TV producer Lotta Backlund started his weight loss in 2009.
He's a total lifestyle change, and he's lost his little mouth for thirty kilos.
Friday Backlund published a very high performance photo pair on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed from her appearance over the years.
The Backlund couple, before and after, has collected a number of praiseful comments from the co-rapporteurs.
You're amazing.
At the same time we're on the same road, the motivation is tough!
Pia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in this project now.
I get the strength and enthusiasm of your images while I'm on the same road, the other tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last few pounds, let's do it on the project now.
At that time, he told the newspaper that he wanted to finally get into normal weight, which was ten kilos away at the time.
During three months of fitness, the pounds finally fell by five.
The hope of a woman who was murdered in Lovis: the memory of the victim for the benefit of police dogs
A week ago, a 42-year-old woman murdered in Lovisa hopes that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and addresses by donations for police work.
Sipoon Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update, which conveys the wish of the victim's family on donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked at the Sipoon Veterinary Station as a substitute and has also completed his nursing training there.
The vet's office reminds me of the words that touch the woman.
Happy, smart, sense of humor and work intimidating.
That's a good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
It is mentioned in the report that the donation allowance is entirely for police dogs, primarily for the acquisition of security vests.
Last Friday, 42-year-old Lovisi was murdered in her own house in Lovisa Koskenkyla.
The women's neighbors have told the newspaper that the victim was a very animal.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, hens, and flowers.
A 27-year-old man who was suspected of murder didn't know a woman and had no connection.
The killer's tracking involved a police dog named Börje, who was life-threatening in the arrest.
But the Börje survived and is recovering.
The Court of Justice delivered a judgment to Post on an infringement of the Equality Act
The post did not have the right to arrest the employee who refused training, to judge Kanta-Häme’s court in his judgment.
The Court of Justice required Post to pay most of the employees the paid salary and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Posti could only have arrested a part of the employee’s salary, which corresponded to the proportion of the study being carried out throughout the day.
According to the judgment of the Court of Justice, the worker had been placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity, contrary to the Act of Equal Opportunities.
The staff member had complied with the PAU’s decision on a ban on education and training in the postal and logistics sectors.
During last November's postal service, the PAU decided that Post workers would not be familiar with the rent workers who broke the strike.
It's the first news of the People's News.
Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey should return to the path of democratic and respect for human rights, write to Prime Minister Juha Sipil (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (p.p.) in his reply to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree with the human rights situation in Turkey.
In his letter to the Journalist Association, Sipila and Soin asked him to express his concern for Turkey's freedom of speech and of the press.
Sipilä and Soini inform Finland that Finland has repeatedly brought forth the importance of freedom of the press and of the expression.
Putin separated his regime from the master's position in the Estonian State of Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has resigned Sergei Ivanov, the President of the President, says Kreml.
This is a Soviet-Viro Communist leader, Karl Vano's grandson, Anton Vano.
He is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been the Deputy Head of Presidential Administration since 2012.
It will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the news office Interfax tells us.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration to the chief.
According to Kremlin’s notice, Ivanov, belonging to the close internal border of Putin, will be transferred to specific environmental and transport tasks.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other duties and suggested that Gono be replaced, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the KGB's spying with the Soviet Union.
Many considered Ivanov as a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but therefore becoming president of Dmitri Medvedev.
Ivanov was appointed as President in 2011 before the re-election of Putin as President in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant prize for a game ban will not be seen in Valoliga's opening
The world record of football transfers will not be seen on the field when the UK Valoli is kicked out for the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed England.
Because of the ban, Paul Pogba is on page at the ManU opening his league Sunday against Bournemouth, he told BBC on Friday.
According to the British Media, ManU paid the Italian Society of Pogba EUR 105 million to Juventus.
However, the UK football union FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was under a ban from Juventus.
He received two warnings from the Italian Cup last season, and it becomes one game ban.
That game ban has been transferred to England, the FA told BBC.
Pogban’s next port to play is the second round of the league on 19 August, when ManU meets Southampton.
At Flow, the madness of magnitude is a virtue.
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the Flow Festival position as an internationally appreciated event marked by the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
In a typical way, the painters have expressed themselves with their own self-sufficient dress.
One of the main stage artists is this year's punk legend Iggy Pop.
The event area of the Flow Festival will be preserved, among other things, by artificial grass and art installation.
It has never been enough for us to have only the main ship and the beer plate, says the artistic leader of the event Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Summer Bay of Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would the authors themselves want to go?
It's kind of strange in the uneventables, that's what we're thinking.
Often the aim is to achieve the level of necessity and operate in accordance with official regulations, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would come to the end this year too.
The goal has been to raise the number of 70,000 visitors last year by 5,000 people.
A number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists are also seen in Festare this year.
The growth of the number of visitors is a good thing because there is some need to fund it.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much because, at some point, mass would be like a cattle flock, controlled by a vast section of the road.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of the successful event has been bloated over 13 years with 130 performers, art collections and numerous restaurants and drinks in the area partially covered by artificial grass.
In addition to the main and smaller fields of performance, this year 15 000 people’s tents operate.
Kallio admits that the event could be more simple.
Maybe I'm a little bit big, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If it disappears, it's not our thing anymore.
The greatest pleasure and reward for the work done is that today, even the great visions are practically possible.
During the early years of the 21st century, activities depended very much on the support of the City of Helsinki of about EUR 20 000.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was around EUR 6 million.
It allows you to create "crees even things", as is the building of that 73-metre wide tent.
The visitors of Flow have typically expressed themselves with their own self-sufficient dress.
In addition to the music event, the community of trendy young adults can be discussed.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as being particularly fashionable.
We want to break up, above all, with content.
Yet the fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the art of the main ship is the legend of a dozen, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he doesn't have the most typical performers of Inderock, Pop music, rapper and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was stunned because this is probably the last time this is seen in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
It's not just what they play on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good, and he's been doing some damn good jobs in the last few years.
The bombs in Thailand's tourist paradise had been hidden in purses - tourists fled in horrors
In Hua Hin, local time blew up two bombs on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the hit and more than 20 injured.
The bombs had apparently been hidden in a flower bag and blew up with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreigners.
They were bombarded at the same time that tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, the police representative, Samoer Yoosumran, according to CNN.
Since 1989, the protector of wild animals, Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, referred to the attacks as a large picture.
If the TV doesn't look good, you can look at it.
There were at least 11 foreign tourists injured in Hua Hin.
The people ran against me and said that the bomb had exploded at the bar.
It took place in one of the biggest bar streets, told Emeli Olsson Aftonbladet the Swedish secretary.
The next morning, the local time blew up two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, even the Finns popular Phukett on the island of Phukett blew up two bombs.
No one seems to have died.
At the same time, Hua Hin had another double-bomb attack.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police told me that they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that hadn't yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, behind the bombings, there are likely rebel troops who are not satisfied with Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, this may also have criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been very vulnerable to trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new team of emergency forces comes first to battle in a war situation
In the acute military situation, guards are told not to engage in battle duties until several months after the wedding of the military election, says the Central Finn.
According to the Chief of Defence, Brig-Gen Jukka Sonninen, who has been interviewed by the magazine, for example, for a period of 5.5 months of military service in the military situation, only those who are at the end of their training are eligible.
According to the Head of Education, the first reserve members of the emergency crew are appointed.
None of the reserveers or reserveers are ordered to perform a task that has not been trained as required, says Sonnen.
In the past summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces are going to train backup personnel to immediate capacity units from next year.
The units may, if necessary, be used in military operations already during military training.
Pamela Tola got a giant raise from home
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, Pauli Waroma, have won a hard fight at the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The commercial price of the double-stored separate house had been EUR 330,000.
However, after commercialisation, the house revealed a serious moisture problem that caused health-threatening microbi growth.
The couple had to sell the apartment as a depot in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so financial losses for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple brought the case to court and asked the seller to make a price reduction.
The salesman denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in the tip and in the court court.
The court delivered the judgment on Wednesday.
It was in force a judgment of the court of the Supreme Court which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for a discount.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the trial and liquidation costs of the couple.
The Court disproportionately explained the price reduction because some of the need to repair the dwelling had already been known to the purchasers when making the sale of the dwelling.
However, according to court’s law, the damage to construction was significantly more serious than what had been proposed.
Tola was looking for a place of good faith.
Tola told me in court that the couple had specifically sought a home of good faith because they did not want to enter repairs.
He had been established with the idea that the building had been renovated and in good condition and that the facts mentioned in the report on fitness checks were not affected.
The municipal inspection report mentioned the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of water flows along rock studies.
However, the discussions did not show that it had been a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma felt that rainwater from the rock might have to be controlled a little over a few years.
Shops were made in October 2009.
Within a few years it became apparent that the problems of the humidity of the dwelling were much more serious than they thought.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed microbi growth, which, according to the Witnesses, was caused by both the rock rainwater and the capillary rising from land pollution.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector’s assessment, reach indoor spaces also through the receipts.
The sands that allow health risk, exceed the limit values, were found in the silk samples in the home room, in the basement stairs, in the living room window and in the basement laundry room.
The Terassas were built without permits
The Court also contested whether the dwelling had been in breach of the extended building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision to change the property.
Among other things, the steels had been built, even though the relevant permits had not yet been granted.
However, home problems were essential in court.
According to the court, the purchasers could assume, on the basis of the information they obtained before trade, that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for measurable repairs in the near future.
The Court of Justice did not consider that there was a particular reason for a more extensive inspection.
The participants have not failed to comply with their reporting obligations, the court finds in its judgment.
The creepy archive: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for the Nazis - also Finns in the register
Editor Christopher Andersson writes in his recent Dagens Nyheter's article on how documents recorded for microfilms in the United States' National Archives in Maryland relate to a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry the SS men.
Most women are Germans, but they also include Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danishs, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finnish women, and 31 Swedish women were wanted.
Documents and registration cards come from a breed agency operating in Nazi Germany.
The breed agency was head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man was allowed to have children in Nazi Germany until he was examined by a SS doctor.
The same applies to women who were to be able to bear even more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynecological studies to determine the case.
The breed agency examined the backgrounds of women by studying church books, among other things.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the female family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up Swedish citizenship and to give life stories and good recommendations from close relatives to the breed agency.
The agency wanted guarantees that women were "children", "sustainers", and "good national socialists", who were very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as Morsam of SSmen.
The article does not tell us what happened to 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a state-sponsored programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme provided, among other things, that each SSman should have four children, whether married or outside.
The Lebensborn homes care for children and mothers born outside marriage.
However, the programme was not actively promoted, the pages of the U.S. holocaust Museum are reported.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The State encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The German mother’s honorary body was awarded to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between the Aryans and the non-Aryans were legally prohibited, and the museum’s pages are found.
And the sixth of Siren, and Nirkko rose, and fell.
Tapio Nirkko placed the third sailing day on the first departure of Finnjollien at the Rio Olympics, but remained the whole group at the end of the day’s second departure.
In the overall situation, Niko rose eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him in place at 14.
The wind of Petija-Siren fought at the departures of RS:X, positions 17 and 3.
In the overall situation, Petija-Siren is six.
In the 470s, Jonahs and Niklas Lindgren remained at the opening stage of the day 23.
In general, Lindgreni is ranked 19.
Jari Sillanpää Satulinna was recorded at night for a couple of hours: "I was so full of candy."
Jari Sillanpää has been a member of Finnish favorite artists for more than 20 years.
From a barmaid in 1995 to a tango King, Sillanpää, who was best sold by Finland as a solo artist, and the star of dance bars and festivals, continues to drill and is currently in a wild upstairs.
A book about Jari Sillanpää, a favorite singer's life, was published today in Paljaana.
The book Sillanpää tells of his life and career as good as bad.
The career of Sillanpää rose to a total rise in his victory on the Seinajoki market in Denmark in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuppamäki had written to Sillanpää at the request of a man in a tango piece, which Kassu Halonen agreed in a slightly different form.
As a result, Satulinna was one of the most popular pieces in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly according to the plans: Sillanpää sang it on the tape in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so full of cake!
The bridge head remembers in the book.
You wouldn't think it'd be in a hangover if you'd put it on fire.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, it was still good.
I learned that you don't have to insist on being perfect and perfect all the time.
Another event related to the most popular songs in the book that is reported happened nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then partner, and the case eventually ended up in the texts of the gold piece that were published in the single one in 2014.
The book tells us that Sarah’s song collections were not exactly what Silas would have wanted.
She had imagined that she was making a record of her own life as a true story, but the words of the separate song were not true, but it was written on the basis of the magazine 7 days ago.
In the news of the newspaper Jari and her ex-love, Jari was told about excessive partying and drinking, but Jari said it was a full stick and that it was not true.
Jari said that he was mad at the record company and refused to sing a song, but eventually he ended up singing it, and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
At the end, 52% of voters were in favour of a difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the opinion of the week was expected to have the opposite result.
The British eco-nomics and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institution or university flagged the difference in favour, although two individual researchers could disagree with the power flow of their profession.
The 'It's the economy, stupid' of the British Brexet vote, was the subject of the recent election campaign by the former US President Bill Clinton.
Economimists were shocked when their voice was not a part of it.
They were shocked when the economy did not appear to be the most important issue of politics.
From the economic curfew
Centre for Macroeconomics tiva in the latest monthly survey of professional answers to Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not heard and heard because this time the voters decided on non-economic grounds.
One explanation of the loss of economic position is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, which is almost standard.
If the immigrant gets a job, it'll be out of the right British.
Many people also have the idea that a fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, the voters did not believe the economic arguments, since the consensus of economials was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, they were deported by the BBC's equity, which provided only as much space as a few per cent of the EU's disparity with economic scientists from the economy as the overwhelming majority.
The EU's hate press was not interested in telling us what IFS, ISM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other differences in economic accounts are.
These far-reaching combinations spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if it was both heard and understood by the Ekonomim messages, they were not transmitted because the economials represent an elite with which voters do not have a common interest in their own eyes.
The academics such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small cities and rural areas the message was not effective.
Immigration is also an economy.
The overwhelming argument of the Brexit vote on the issue of immigration.
Immigrants take your job, the immigrant destroys your hospital, the immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Each cafe has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to have medical appointments if they didn't have them?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place to go to school if they got rid of them?
In every municipality, there are foreigners.
How much more space do you guys have if they'd get out of here?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists were unable to respond to them, and if they did, their responses did not get visibility.
The economists were unable to explain that British immigrants have more jobs, less health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the UK public finances and their consumption generates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund reserved for Brex
One of the funds was the Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments correspond to the Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, in Aberdeen, he was able to prepare plans A and B in time for Brex.
A few weeks before the vote, the plan for the victory of the B camp, which is to be supported by the EU, started to be more specific in case the result was low.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
As a rule, real estate funds do not have extensive liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on Day 23, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, the Old One says Aberdeen's only open-ended daily notes about the real estate fund that the news were about.
According to the old man, the normal level would be between 15 and 20 per cent.
At that time, the value of the fund was EUR 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is about 20 billion dollars.
It was the highest number of real estate funds in nine open real estate funds, and Vanhanen says of all the open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10 % or even below.
The real estate funds were therefore very strategically reserved for Brex.
Money closes trade
When the EU-different camp won, Europe went into a mess.
However, less than two weeks after the vote on the real estate market were quite peaceful, the Old One says.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech of the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, in which he estimates that Brext could be a big risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the real estate funds first, Standard Life, frozen their trade.
Together, these guys took over the situation and brought the case to the main points of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared between 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calm, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started to roll, and after that, the fund had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but eventually it had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close down trade, but changed prices downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out of panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't be worth it, because it would cost you losses.
It calmed the situation, and most cancelled the notification.
Since then, it was quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks, says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, the Manner-Europe Funds in Aberdeen had no similar impact.
However, there were a lot of questionnaires.
Unforeseeable attention to real estate funds
According to the old man, closures of real estate funds were disproportionate.
The open funds covered by the closures are managed by about four per cent of British real estate.
The closure of Aberdeen lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its fund for 2017.
At present, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not appear to be much more "for Aberdeen".
The major issues now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
In addition, there is a 15% discount on the market in relation to the period prior to the Brexit vote.
The Dollarist can now buy the same property by up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, says Vanhanen.
Brexit brought in some of London's real estate markets
At 2:00 a.m., the situation didn't look too much.
But at 4:00, when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for real estate investment in the British Real Estate Fund of the Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's your word.
I realized this is going to Plan B, and Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He was headed for work right away.
London City was already fully alive despite the night of the morning.
The TV screens normally set out to be non-voting at the office supported the news, and usually the sounding people were silently listening when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell us about his divorce.
When the market opened, the evidence signs flashed just red.
It was the morning he never thought he was alive, the Old One says.
It is not, however, that despite myllery, Aberdee, one of the UK's largest real estate funds, finished two real estate trades on the day after the Brexit vote.
It was a mess.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and therefore the situation was kind of calm, says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote began with the correction movement
The vote followed the storm.
Panda collapsed, British leadership went to change.
The market started to anticipate harsh invoices on the British real estate market, especially in London.
At London office facilities, up to 20% of mines were expected in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the storm has fallen, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
It does not show, though, its last summer holidays this week in Helsinki on the faces of Vanhase.
In his view, it is still too early to say much about what comes from Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already been first reported.
The CBRE data on price developments in the real estate service company cover about one third of the market.
According to them, London's prices of all properties decreased by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office building, minus 6.1 per cent, the Old One reads.
The figures aren't that bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index was published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All the same dropouts hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, too, that Brexit was compared very quickly to Lehman's fall and the global economic crisis that began on the US real estate market.
The old man feels that the comparison is not quite a match, as it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
There's another mood, too.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
There's a lot of money, too.
In any event, the repair operation could have been in the way
In fact, it's not a miracle for him to be in front of him without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of real estate in London and other world cities have been too high for years.
For two years now, we have said that City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the drop was really high.
London prices have been written up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, so has London's population.
Another big trend is that properties are the last class of ownership that globalises, says Vanhanen.
New players have become on the market from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate sites abroad.
London as a known city is an easy target.
In addition, prices have been fed by a low rate of interest, which has led, for example, pension companies to look for returns on new sites.
On this point, the loan has been easily available - although the debt gap has been used by Vanhasen now much less than during the boom before the crisis in 2008.
Disperse, disperse.
In London, the rise in prices rose last summer, Vanhanen tells us.
Even Aberdeen began to reduce his ownership in London, and last year he was a net seller.
There was some kind of turning ahead, and now it came.
What's from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He's not afraid to judge, but he says that there's hardly any rise in it.
The feeling suggests that there is a downward or a level playing field ahead.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the hole is being survived at work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global dispersal.
If you've invested in one market, it's too much of a sacrifice.
If you've broken up, the risks are also decentralised, the Old One says.
S-Group starts to register the purchase data in more detail
As soon as the S-Group knows what you eat, today the trading group has told us that it will start to collect more accurate information about the purchases of its customers.
So far, when data on the final amount of receipts have been collected, the group will start in early May, also for the products purchased.
The S-group will come here after Kesko, because the data on the goods purchased with the plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitalan, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data shall be collected with the consent of the customer and used on a licensed basis for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
A little customer has denied the use of product information, Riitala says to the Economic Area.
According to him, Kesko is not going to respond to Group S registration change.
Kesko has already classed its customers according to only the food purchases into ten groups.
The classification shall be updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money they spend.
The data are used for the purpose of marketing for the customer.
The product-specific purchase data shall only be collected from the K-group’s own chains.
Cooperation partners such as Neste Oil do not provide any information.
Lidl Finland has no master client program and no such program is planned.
Finland's Middle Market has its own "Ykkösbonus" customer program, which can be linked to Valtatalo, Siwok and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect product or product group data, we remain at the end of the receipt.
So we know where the purchase was made, and that day, and the final sum of the customer's receipt.
We haven't gone to that level like a group K or a group S, says commercial leader Anu Ora.
He said that it is intended to be a reform of the customer programme in the future, but the Middle Market will tell you later.
However, Ora does not promise to register product information.
First try
To date, the SOK's customer ownership and customer registration has been relatively wide.
In addition to personal and address data, basic information has included the profession, education, housing and children’s birth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The purchase of S-Ecurities has been recorded on the date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of purchases and the method of payment.
In addition, data from S-boning partners have been obtained from their cash-systems.
From May onwards, purchase data at product level will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismos, Kod Terro and ABC chains, data are currently recorded at product group level.
For a longer time customers have had hopes that marketing could be more focused, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Owner and Partner’s Business of the SOK.
Group S says he's informed about the change he's made to his customers.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data are recorded in cats in any case, whether they want it or not.
The person who wants to check the stored information can be found on the S Group website.
For example, the cashiers do not access the data, stress Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-puptu is Customs's latest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The Black Labrador-outer’s puppy is enchanted by five similar cases of rowed box at Helsinki Airport.
It won't take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with his favorite toy.
In the box next to which Heila sat, a jar of shells smelling on the square gas was revealed.
The fumes are the first smell of what has been practiced with Heila now, says Suntio, the owner of Heila dog.
Safety situation and access to online commerce
Heila is the first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and is placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The work might take Heila and Suntion to other crossing points and ports as necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main job as the international security situation has changed due to major terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused the measures and attacks in Tull, which have been confirmed, says Telli's supervisor Mikko Grönberg.
Another access to training for weapons and explosives dogs is mailing via Helsinki Airport.
As a result of increased internet traffic through airport, up to 40 million mails are carried out annually, including arms and explosives from abroad.
In recent years, the customs authorities have made a search for approximately 300 weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives related to online shopping, passenger goods and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It's going to investigate registered baggage and mailing.
In port it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and label areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the track performance, Customs assesses whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg has a hopeful attitude to the idea.
School in Kirkkonumme
Heila-pennunuku's training is coordinated by the Tullin Dog School in Kirkkonnumme.
Suntio also attends training with Heila at police and defence experts.
Police have strong experience in training dogs and defence forces with expertise in explosives.
Customs will decide together with other authorities what smells Heila are taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues in Helsinki Airport are Tullin's six drug dogs, as well as the Money and Drug Dog Mass.
Labrador extractor Heila has been chosen from ten puppy dogs.
The selection criteria for the dog selected for the airport include the pick-up and hunting net, as well as the peace, because the dog is involved in weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, home to Suntion, is a close associate of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing without Heila gets home, Suntio laughs.
The fine orders go to Heila from a time frame.
The cameraman of the evening Sanoma will lose the camera cover for the fast dog, but Heila will return the soft toy from the "irti" command immediately.
Hard competition from working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still standard tests ahead, next October, which assesses whether training is sufficient for the necessary tasks.
Heila can be seen at work in Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes well according to the plans.
Regrettably, passengers cannot come to iron their work vests on a dog, like Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is around EUR 60000/year for customs.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they retire for the care of their owner.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active participations last for only ten minutes.
The owner of working dogs is a tough competition in Tull.
Heila owns about 20-30 Customs employees.
Lucky hit Suntion, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and surveillance tasks in Tull.
The state has its first Olympic medal - the people will have a day off.
In Rugby, the Olympic Olympic Olympics in Fiji, less than one million inhabitants live, are so highly appreciated that the government has appointed the 22 August national holiday.
According to Earth's broadcasting company, Fiji's government confirmed the matter after the championship was resolved.
The day off, they'll take the team home the next day.
There are also festives for the heroic team in their own country.
Fiji's rugby team is celebrating the championship.
The Guardian says that the country was followed by a finalist in the capital of Suvala, where the stadium had been set up by a screen.
Normally, only the naive Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game joined our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage, told the Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru Guardian.
The drama in Rio - the Finnish woman passed out after her wild performance
In his last attempt, Milan Tokola succeeded 175 pounds after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life - threatening character as a lifter.
During or immediately after the heavy lifts, he's passed out many times.
No one's really been able to say why.
Tokola gained 175 kilos and 145 kilos of labor in Rio.
He was a total of 320 kilos.
Tokola was trying to get her job killed at her last 75 pounds, as did the other one.
In the third attempt, the weights rose as a result of a wild screaming.
The crown would shake under the weights until the judge accepted the raise.
The joy of the Finnish employer is that he has suffered from knee problems.
ROPS has acquired a Estonian employee Prosan - Veikkausli - Ilta-Santam
The Rovaniemi Ballo Society of Men's Football League has reached the end of the season with the Estonian player Albert Prosa.
We are looking for the top player of our team with power and the threshold for Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through a lot of 50 players from all over the world with more than ten players.
As a good alternative, Prosa, coach Juha Malinen, began to separate from the small hive.
Prosa, 25, comes to RoPS from the Tallinna Flora, where he made 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played for Estonia's country team.
Prosan is due to be with RoPS on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemis meet the master SJK of Finland.
RoPS became a need for a new attacker when last season’s secular king Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family star will once again come true: teen star shorts will reveal almost everything
As a nice Alex Dunphyna, the modern family comedy series, Ariel Winter, once again shatters by presenting his proud body.
Winter was shot in Hollywood this week in minishorts that don't leave much to imagination.
The shorts exposed not only the actor's legs but also this behind.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making its style and behavior much more courageous.
The star has been posted in images published in social media in extremely few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressed in very few costumes.
Winter, at the threshold of eternity, has recently published several images of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it from here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected Winter's having a "typical Hollywood transformation" child star as an adult.
He has been on television almost all his life and has grown during the Kardashians ’ era.
He has learned that the more it appears to reveal the surface, the more publicity and attention it receives in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family Series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has been heartbroken by some of his long-term fans with their image changes.
It's not hard to guess where he is in ten years' time, when the lower end is now that hard, says a woman in Winter Instagram.
Some of the female fans, however, are defending the actor and are urged to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what everyone else says.
You're inspired by many women, by a young woman.
The Japanese prefer from the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists to be lured with a tear: In autumn, it is possible to see a randommirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to begin the retreat trips from the start, Visit Finland reports in the newsletter.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations for the Japanese return tour.
Revon fires are our winter travel maps, and they are strongly connected to the heart winters and snowy landscapes.
There is a lot of demand for the children's winter renovation in winter, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
It is rare to know that the tear season begins from the early autumn and continues far into the spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the fires from the vision made by two times by chance, says the press release Visit Finland, see marketing manager Anne Lind.
Visits Finland's main focus group is wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and its design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising.
According to a survey carried out by researchers from Aalto University as well as from Turku and Tokyo universities, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like a clearer unique view of Finland, and according to Lind, this revolution has enormous potential.
Nights spent by Japanese tourists have grown much more in Finland than other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than doubled in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are of interest to Finland as a target group for tourism as they spent over EUR 80 million in Finland.
Average Japanese people spent 183 euros in Finland a day, Lind says.
The British settles the master class of rugbyhopea Fid, leading to gold
The impressive progress of the UK in the rugby tournament failed to meet the last challenge of Fidz in Thursday night's final, when the team experienced 43-7 fractures at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi arranged a master's course at the time, in the cracks, in the poles, in the back game, in the runts and in the silk when he won the gold - their first Olympic medal.
There was a reasonable comfort in the silver team from the third of the United Kingdom Day and they were proud of their hard work in the opening tournament of the Olympics in Rugby, where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard 7-5 winners of South Africa of a semifinal played earlier that day may have been a source of trouble for them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a team of 15 people in this condition.
Great Britain may, but probably not, be comforting that at least one British will have a gold medal in his neck tomorrow: Fid's chief coach is Ben Ryan, former boss of Wimbledon, England.
It's been a long trip to Britain.
Eight years ago, they were trained by Ryan to lose every game in the Adelaide tournament.
This is where they only lost one.
This spine hurts, but it's a shocking development.
Fidi began excellently to combat British accents for pleasure.
To Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like running toward mobile buses, and world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived into the finish area in the corner.
When the clock was four minutes, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right side led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant move stopped the man- Mountain Leone Nakarawan from making the third goal, but it was only slow for Fid.
In seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner, and Britain had a 17-0 loss.
Nakarawa once again scored a new start, and the clock still had more than one minute left... the first half of the time.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou ran through the United Kingdom's discovery of bars and rushed into the line to make a goal.
After the hit, the situation on the break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Britain was only teaching the game.
And that's what it really is.
The United Kingdom made a break-up change that blocked Fid's dam... for four minutes, which was good compared to the first half of the time until Joua Tuisova scored the goal after Fid's impressive input game.
Dan Norton scored the British goal in the left corner of touchdown and poured the situation to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea islanders, whose supporters sang, waving flags and dancing in the viewers.
It was difficult not to admire Fid's glamorous approach.
There was a peeling in Fid's cake last minute that didn't need a peeling.
The bull was greened, the Fidish hugged, and the Great Britain fell on the lawn, totally hit.
Earlier that day Fidi had hit Japan's semifinal in 20-5, and Britain won South Africa's tight semifinal, where both made one goal - the British goaloff.
Kyle Brown took South Africa's leadership in the first half of the time, but Dan Norton crossed the goal area with a glamorous footwork and scored goal under the second half of the time.
It's a great late guarantee from Marcus Watson, England's 15-are-rugby team from Anthony's brother, to ensure victory and finally a silver medal.
The battle of the coach against cancer led Helen Glofer and Heather Stanning into the race victory.
These races will not have feelings for more glamorous gold, and that really means something.
From the first bet to the last 220 hard deportation on history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in Estacio da Lagoa from their golden moment.
While they were rowing alone, there were three votes in the boat, and the echo of Coach Robin Williams was present all the time, while the twin was in a series of Olympic Games in the women's double contest, the first women in the history books of British sports, which are at the top of this achievement.
Their rule was perfect, and this was the 39th appearance undefeated, which is also recordable.
This is what we see, two brilliant athletes joining the surface with the smoothness of the bow, does not fully picture the nature of the victory.
For each row, there are a group of helpful hands that gradually promote those things that have meaning, and none of them were as important as the coach who did not know 30 months ago after receiving cancer diagnosis, whether he would live up to this day.
As he said, the situation was a mess.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they did surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It changes your way of thinking.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third was fortunate that his treatment was able to start at the beginning of 2014 outside the period, when they caused as little disruption as possible - if it could ever be used in such situations.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the department, 20, 30, 50 feet at a time, saying that a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
It's a long way off, but it'll make it a little bigger.
Immediately after winning the first couple of thoughts was Williams, who had been nervous in the morning, and he had spoken a little bit more than usual, trying to handle his own nervousness.
Stanning, the former commander of the Afghan command from the royal cannon regiment, said: "I have been a tunnel this week, which may be a little overreacted, but this means so much to me."
It just stresses how important this is to me how much I and Helen, and Robin too, we have worked.
It's been three years with Helen and Robin. It's been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be doing anything, so she has great thanks, she's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost competition for five years.
The couple set up a rough rhythm their competitors didn't catch.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish teams began approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in the warehouse.
We were very close in a moment.
Helen screamed "Pysy in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything special.
We were not looking for fireworks today, just trying to win a good society and race, and so we did.
A couple waits a year before deciding about their future.
Glover's going to be at the wedding next month when he's getting married to a TV adventurer, Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this would be my last competition.
It would've put too much pressure on him.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed out.
This is where it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland Changes the Board of Panama Mountains
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which the protestors of Panama's data leaks have already called for in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed tax evasions of several Icelandic politicians through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the protestors.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the recent rage of the people affects the autumn election result.
In the June presidential elections, criticism of those taking power was clearly seen, and Mr Johannesson, who was outside of politics, was elected President.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isisi.
President of the US Republic Donald Trump withdrew his latest speeches.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organisation Isisi and the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to be involved in the establishment of an organisation.
The Democratic Party was upset by the speeches and called for an apology from Trump.
The military chief should never let anyone fall down like that, Clinton.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a burkini bathing suit, which is popular for Muslims on the bathing beaches, says, among other things, British magazine Guardian.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnar, states that going to shores and swimming is prohibited for everyone who does not have a good way and a self-respectable bathing suit.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which greatly indicate religious ties, can increase the risk of order disturbances in France, which has been targeted by terrorist attacks.
In mid - July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31 - year - old man drove to a crowd celebrating French National Day.
At the end of July, two men connected to Isis attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of bathing waters in Oulu area passed through the Seula - Pyykösjärvi with blue seams
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only Blue opacities have been observed on the Pyyyköskärvi bathing area.
During Tuesdays and Wednesdays, environmental activities in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU shores and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu region.
Apart from the coast of Meriniemi, the levels of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in bathing waters in all bathing areas below the limits of the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
Water levels of E.coli and enterococc were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operational limits.
The blue slurry found on the shores of Lake Lake Island does not yet make the water inability to swim, but, under favourable circumstances, the situation may quickly turn into a blue - green kelp.
Environmental action follows the situation with more intensive controls.
If the sealing port becomes blue-tailed, it shall be notified separately on the bathing area information table.
Look at the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK Hakkarainen on forest gifts reduction: More than 80% of forest owners outside
A forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction that would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generation exchange of forest holdings.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal for forest gifts has four objectives: promoting generational changes in forest farms, promoting the age structure of forest owners, increasing the size of forest farms and increasing the supply of wood.
The objective of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would make a reduction in the pure income of the forest economy.
Above all, the idea of making such a tool to promote generations of forest farms is good, commenting on the forestry producers of the Central Union (MTK) Director Juha Hakkarainen.
However, it is difficult to find a critical proposal for tax change.
A reduction in forest gifts is proposed as a function of the pure income of the forest owner.
It is a capital income that has been deducted from all other reductions.
In the opinion of the MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if a reduction could be made directly from the result of the sale of wood.
The proposal of the VM leaves the way in which a reduction of the pure income from the forest economy prevents the loss of the capital income of the forest, which should be reduced in other taxes.
Such a person would benefit from a tax advantage even if he did not want to sell.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to visualize it, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, the model applies only to a small part of forest owners.
The limit on the tax reduction committed to forest return is EUR 40,000.
It's drawn to the Hakkarainen's mind. It's too high.
As such, he said that 82 percent of Finnish forest owners would be cut off.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest heritage, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of farming.
In forest policy, a reduction in forest gifts has been taken according to Hakkarainen for decades.
It is based on the ageing of forest owners.
According to the MTC, the average age of forest owners is now over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are retired.
A powerful racoon surprised the drivers in Himanga - two cars stuck in a stream and ran into each other.
In the Kalajoki Himanga there was a special turn on Friday morning.
According to the rescue facility, two consecutive times of the car went down into a stream after which the fire came after the driver ahead.
According to the sleeper's firemaster Harri Pyyhtis, he is suspected to have been a result of a powerful stroke.
There were two people in the back of the car who were both transported to the hospital to the hospital.
There's no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver of the earlier car was not injured.
The accident occurred on the highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometers to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings of Professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group show that the hardness of cancer tumor increases cancer’s evil quality.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow in a normal way in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the cancer surrounding tissue to match normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer medications may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue, in addition to cancer cells.
On 4 August, the results were published in a highly respected Nature Communications magazine in the field of cell biology.
The victim's death continues in court, and the prosecution also demands a murder sentence for another person.
The suit of the family home death of the musks continues in the court for both convicted.
Two young men were convicted of the death of a family home in Muhoks in June.
One received 8 years for 4 months, among other things, of killing young people and serious robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and serious robbery as a young person.
A convicted person was also sentenced to serious road safety threats as a young person and to carry a vehicle as a young person.
The judgment of the Court of Justice was appealed to by the prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who received a more severe judgment.
The prosecutor demands that the man who has been punished be convicted of murder as a young person for 12 years in prison.
They were at the moment of action in full understanding.
According to the Court of Justice, the 17-year-old youngsters killed the schoolhouse as head of the child protection unit working in July last year.
The 17-year-old who received the hit was indicted by the conviction that he was behind the pilot sitting on the couch of the living room.
The director had been able to get rid of him and put him in his young room, and one of the young hit him with a vacuum pipe.
Among other things, the controller was strangled with a wire, hit and kicked in the head.
According to the demonstration, both convicted men were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape family homes at least since the day before.
Ice shark is the most long-lasting spine in the world, growing only at 156 years old.
The world’s longest live vertebrate is confirmed by the ice shark, reports the research published in the Science magazine.
In the northern parts of the Atlantic, like icefish floating around Greenland, a hoker can live up to 400 years old.
She's only growing when she's 156.
The ice age adds that it will grow only in a centimeters a year.
Only one species of bivalve molluscs is known to be longer than live ice sharks.
Researchers found the age with a radio carbon boost.
Because of the nuclear experiments in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on that, researchers were able to assess the age of sharks.
For old age, it was estimated that 392 years - yes, a throw in the direction or another could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic wiser - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need any more of the world.
Even one third of all tax revenues from the State would be missed if the change in company tax was implemented by Donald Trump.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular with tax incentives that benefit most.
Trump described his tax programme as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
Corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without collecting it, it would be a huge amount of $1,000 billion a year.
The upper income tax rate is now 39,6, after the cut by Trump 33.
They'd give up all the inheritance tax.
Trump accused the State of over-regulation in business and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental standards which have been decided on by the emergency installations must be re-established and the energy regulation must be broken down.
The healthcare reform of Barack Obama must be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed as "experts rather than bureaucrats".
According to Trump, "the harmful" trade policy is the main cause of the problems facing the United States.
Free trade agreements would be called off.
45% of imports from China and 35% of Mexico would be subject to a penalty tax.
We'll offer you a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our confession, Trump declared it.
Donald Trump America doesn't have to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American aircraft to unite cities, American ships to control the sea, American steel to lift up new skyscrapers throughout the country.
By way of fact, Trump faithfully read the words written by the assistants, even though well - organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump's program taking the United States to a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton released his own program early on Friday in Finland.
An attack on the past - People's News
The sea is fatally mallling, but the actual attack wave is hitting in the middle of Madrid's street villa - whether an account can start with the past.
It summed up Pedro Almodvar's novelty story.
Almodovar's previous directional work Travel growers (2013) was a small hair and ronzkiny satiric comedy, a premier skin where I live (2011) the peaks of the Spanish situr career.
Julieta (2016) is placed somewhere between those two works.
It's a kind of internal love, a human relationship and a family drama with a mother-and-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and we'll see a lot of it as a long way back.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged denominator (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the after-stampings of random encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be wondrousally all the way to the finals of the film.
In the form of a back and long letter, Juliet's life course for her grown-up daughter.
He starts from the time before the daughter was born, from the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta's young teacher Adraina Ugarte, a TV-based series between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Juliet's ageing has been treated in a way that can be considered a cook, but I'd say it's a strange and literal wipe.
For Almodóvar films, there is often a fair distance in Julieta to such a characteristic humorousness.
It is a well-informed, controlled, location in places of good music, and quite sad film with the elements of eleggy.
Instead, the visual color beauty typical of the Spanish director is recorded and is beginning to inject small silence into the eye as a pure design rather than an effective dramatic mechanism.
Diseases, deaths or only sudden loss of life, but the surface remains as Korean.
This applies in particular to clothing: in the case of a nominal person, you change from scene to scene, and the same applies to the visible ears.
Almodóvar is very specific in these matters, but the main point is that the premises of the current scene are not particularly improved.
Mechanically, once again, the effect is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript on the basis of three novels of Alice Munron, a Canadian, awarded in Nobel 2013.
Novellit is published in the book Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly flattered written literary filming.
Materials would have been emotionally superiorly more dramatic to drama, to the extent that big things - especially pale guilt - are dealt with by the ethics of the movie.
Control and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
In capitals: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of the film is 12.8.
The government's trying to play the election game - People's News
No new cuts will be made, hot ministers, so that the basic Finns do not collapse completely.
However, the cutbacks decided in the spring will be made by rappers.
There will be no new surgery.
Four billion savings have already been decided.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister of Finance Petrer Orpo (kok).
It is true that there are no new cuts in the proposal of the VM, since the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring frame bed.
Children's pension, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training operations continue.
Kuntales haunting
Why do ministers so hard to stress that there will be no new cuts on them?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipalities will be held in April and they will be the main heat meter of the parliamentary term, not the gallup.
In the past, it has been seen that the performance of the government's performance, which takes the different directions of the government parties, is ruining the government's mood for a long time.
However, the Gallupi reports that the Government's main Finns are waiting to be killed, although the result of the previous elections was only 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, Finnishs received 752 new delegates, most of which will be realised next spring at the price of influence in the judiciary.
The life line of the government of the three equal parties is in the hands of the basic Finns.
Now it has not endured, but more than half of the voters had the need for government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visits have also come to the surface.
The fact that new surgery will not come with the rhetorics will be clouded by the fact that next year they will be brutally made and, secondly, they will try to soften the expected attack on the basic Finns.
Large surgery in 2018?
In a year's time, it'll probably be different if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set a target for the fight against debt in this parliamentary term, but the Petter Orpo budget proposal will be spent next year at EUR 5.9 billion, which is more than this year.
After royal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and to admit that the government is not able to follow its own programme: debt is not overpowered or even slowed.
The second one is to stick to the program.
This means even more severe cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would at least be renegotiated close to the balance during 2018, and then in the spring, the parliamentary elections will take place against what will come.
The debt-to-equity of these activities is not a good thing.
It is quite clear that the current measures do not lead to debt, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to trigger a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäen at the Committee on Budgets are unresponsibly proving:
The world economy's growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. there will be no veto aid from the international economy.
After the collapse in 2008, Finland's national economy has not just risen, except during the recovery policy at the beginning of the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent in this decade and has increased on average from 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
In 2014, the current general government debt, which exceeded the 60 % limit, will rise to 70% in mid-2014.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the left-wing union was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs about EUR 6 billion, which is practically fully covered by the new debt.
This is the central, assembly and basic Finnish concept of what is responsible.
Question: A lot of work is being done for the municipality.
Three out of four consider the organisation of day care, youth work and exercise for children to be the responsibility of the municipality, as shown in KAKS - The study of the Finnish Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Area.
A clear majority of the people are also responsible for libraries, culture, civil education, construction supervision, upper secondary education and waste management.
In turn, the responsibility of the county is more determined by the rural development scheme, special care, vocational training, vocational higher education and institution care for people with developmental disabilities.
None of the local authorities' duties are to be transferred to the State.
A minor race ran back and forth to the end of the driveway, running away from the police.
The 16-year-old motor biker in Joensuu drove the police department away at the Ilomantstiant on Friday night at half the same time.
The police force tried to stop without lights driving the motorcycle, but the young man went driving the police to run away from a fair speed.
The back track continued on the Sokajan coast, from which to the Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle was driven out of the road.
After that, the young man ran away, but the faster the police ran into the fugitive.
The flight test for the driver showed 0.75 prommel.
And he didn't have a driver's license that would have given him the right to drive a motorcycle.
The case is examined, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck that was in the stone truck fell down in the ditch.
The truck in the coal truck fell down on the lake Polvijärvi on Thursday night at 21.15 p.m.
The truck was driven to the left in a turnway and fell out of the way and fell on its side.
The rescue facility lifted the injured driver through the door above the fallen truck, along with the rescue helicopter staff and first guards.
The lifting of the vehicle remained the responsibility of the car's owner.
From a fallen truck, hydraulic oil was poured into the road, which was absorbed by the rescue plant.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The old lady disappeared in the afternoon on the Air River
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since afternoon in the Gulf of Lahtinkyla, South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for about 165 centimeters long, careful, and good-looking women with white hair under their chin.
The findings and indications of lost movements are requested to call the tip number of the North Pole's situation centre 0295440513.
The materials of the great accident in the air - see the photo gallery of the Paraphess' destruction
The feuds of Parafest festival tents, which fell through the blast flow, caused massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafestystystitus, estimates that the festival will be able to get to its feet economically, and the event can also be organised next year.
The last performer of Parafess was Kalle Salonen at the end of Friday night on the tulip.
The program will continue on Saturday at 13 a.m. on the premises of the city theatre.
The art center in Ahjo is the Parafest exhibition from 13 am to 15.
The programme will be organised in a planned way.
The flow rate is generated in the thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a fall in the air flow.
Changes in the state of the deep cloud of water bind heat and, therefore, the falling air cools and speeds towards the earth are accelerated.
An air science institution reports that there are several flood flows in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the way in which the flow rate is due.
The drop-off was hit by the Parafest event on the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum Friday afternoon before 5:00.
Three tents fell into reverse, there were about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people were mildly offended.
There was one child in the group who was slightly injured to follow-up treatment.
Air pollution ageing London
According to the study, London's skin is getting older faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
It's about the British research, according to Eventing Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that two and a half years of London’s skin is two and a half years older than the age partner living in rural areas.
The skin-solding small particles are a very fine dusty pollution, which is the source of transport fuel.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Eventing Standard, are nearly 9,500 lontos each year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to pass the outer layer of the skin.
In the Cac study it was found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those in London who walk their way in the vicinity of the congested streets.
People in London can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, in different masks, but it is recommended that regular skin cleansing be given a more practical solution.
Tractor's brakes betrayed a man standing in front of you.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got off the tractor and went to visit it in front, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor fell on the man.
The man did not remain under it, but the tractor, however, got to the point where he was transported to the Central Hospital for further investigations, seriously injured.
The tractor didn't make it any further, for it ran into stones in front of him.
Rising With New Power for the Future Year
At the volleyball Master League, a riverman Liiga-Riento leaves a series of better starting points in October than a man's memory.
The team's been in a team for three weeks now.
There is more certainty in the common cell than in the previous periods, when the series’s bottoms have been darker for Rienno.
Jani Säis, who continues as head coach of the race, greets the new team as an attemptr and uniform.
From a foreign triangle, a middle stormer, Fred Muson, will begin his second season in Rieden.
The new faces are 23 years old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who's been in Rwanda's country team, is a 20-cent hacker.
Garchet is, accordingly, a passer, a Brazilian with a measure of 198 cents.
Through Josban, Kataja and Jokipoik, to the U.S. Land Force
Anne Jpartnernen has played in almost all of the Salibandy's World Championships since 2003.
Now there are six races going on in Tampere, only 2013 after Canada was better off in North America's Karsins.
I was working in Turku and playing with those women when I noticed the announcement.

In 1967, he was born near the city of Elizabeth, New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987, Jpartnernen was able to study data processing at the University of Joensuu.
When I came to Joensuu, the species was not yet played at the MS level as salibandy.
It was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja, and later in Jokipoj, hockey in the SM series, Jpartnerne remembers.

Beach Volley Artist Essi Hasun's circle closes to Kouvola - SM gold missing from the prize box
Essi Hassu is about to quit as a Beach Volley player at least after the temporary season.
The Finnish championships of the Beach voyeur will be settled during the weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, the medals are played in the series of adults and young people.
In cooperation with Kouvola’s volleyball players and the Finnish Aviation Ball Association, six best pairs of the wrists of each series are eligible for the SM-final tournament.
The local color of the tournament represents Elymäen NMKY, Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach Volley flag for several years.
Today, the Hasu living in Helsinki is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to see me this weekend.
I'm sure it's gonna be a great arena for the pessis stadium.
I haven't played in the adults' series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu tunnel.
The Kouvola district set off Hasu's spark for sports and gave good luck for a wonderful hobby.
There's a lot of memories about childhood.
When I was nine years old, I started the volleyball at Elimäen NMKY's E-girls.
The main is the mind too big to play shirt, the knee shields that spin on the ankles, and the huge midgets and choreographs after the points, Hasu recalls.
In small areas, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The spirit of the group created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were heavily involved in the teammate's father trained us and our mother was the chairman of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasulle Beach Volley was already a natural species choice for the counterweight of indoor balloon.
The beach on the riverside has already played a song since the 1990s.
These activities have always been active.

Solomon Koli was bravely going to be a farmer.
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means risk-taking, sweat and energy.
Young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural farmer because he believes in a positive future also in the countryside.
Koli started working with his little brother Valteri Koli about two years ago as a successor to their home condition.
Their father Markus Koli helps and counsels brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a farmer meant taking debt and increasing the order so that bread could come into hand with agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been a pleasure at the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If there's anything to start, I think it's gotta be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went to build a hot tub, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
However, I myself came to the project with great courage, and I have been fully involved in it, says Solomon Koli, and adds that he would not have done it if he had no faith in producing pure Finnish food and in making it all right.
The aim of Solomon Kol’s car - growing car is to invest even more in his bigger nave.
The work has yielded results, for Solomon Koli has been chosen for the 10 best groups in the competition of the young food producer in the Future of Rural Region magazine.
At best, he competes for a possible win.
He's allowed to vote on the magazine's website until 21.8.
Bulgaria first reports inflation for eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest number of years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero after October of last year, when positive 0.2% was reported.
The average annual inflation, measured by the cost of living index, was - 0.8% in the last 12 months (October 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (December 2014 - July 2015).
The cost of living index of July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) inflation rate has been -0.2 %, and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2 % compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, an increase in the price of the following consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
The prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and training.
Snapchat's "anime" efficiency is appreciated as Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, an anime has been inspired by the source of the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its Linsing Tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to develop reality and play identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into ananax, a dog or a character that would match Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
The lenses are simple, face-reversible tools that produce over 30 million improved selfie daily.
All the delusions quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticised for the accusation that the application advertises blackface, i.e. "black face" mask, or favours whitening of skin color as beauty idea.
So this week, when Snapchat advertised lenses to some users that gave them tips on their eyes, tips on teeth and purple cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people, "the yellowface."
And they wonder if these repeated nothings could be a sign of the company's greater problem regarding diversity.
News and blasphemy spread on a large Wednesday with the reports of The Vergen and Motherboard, and the day later, Snapchat said that he had ceased the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The Linssi was meant to be an honour to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But for those who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of the offensive stereotypes of action.
Others said nothing of anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, was widely distributed from the photographs, said that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that "it is difficult to argue against a comparison that is next to the most severe Asian caricature and filter enhancements".
It shows that the filter is not just a yellower, but a yellow container, led to extreme defamation.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught in an endless struggle for diversity and involvement, from the conference rooms of corporations to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s vast, racially older young people can mean that they are even more likely to expect a understanding attitude.
At the interview on Thursday, the 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates a user-injuring image, "it's much more difficult for these guys to be unnoticed".
On Thursday Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to remove Snapchat's account and asked others to do the same.
In writing to Medium and a phone interview, he said that he believed that the disputes relating to race reflect the lack of diversity of Snapchat's remuneration practices.
Zhu criticized the company's main white male leadership and decided to write his work with Hastag #DeleteSnapchat (#PastaSnapchat)
"Even if they do not have a diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, so they can make decisions like this," said the Chinese American Zhu, "or they have different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or can speak directly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has failed largely.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, with reference to its status as a private company.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss his staff's rotations, but according to the representative, the company hired the recruiter some time ago to focus on the under-represented populations and to move forward internal integration efforts.
For their part, Zhu said that he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding: "Is it really necessary to have more users like us in order to say that this is not okay?"
According to the Congress Panel, military officials distorted Isis intelligence data
In a report published on Thursday, the Congress Panel said that the U.S. military headquarters of the United States military area had the most optimistic image of war in Iraq and Syria against Isisi than was justified by the events on the ground.
The interim report of the Working Party on Defence Forces set up by the Republican Committee of the Houses of Representatives, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Fund Sub-Committee found "a broad dissatisfaction" among the intelligence analysts in the main Chamber who said that they were dissatisfactioned with the efforts of the Americans to win Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcoma, is the military military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The results of the poll accepted by more critical Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of the U.S. anti-terrorist efforts than were justified by the facts on the ground, which were more systematically positive than the analyses produced by other factors in the intelligence community", the press release of the report said.
"Centcom's events are unacceptable - our fighters in war suffer when poor analyses are presented to senior decision-makers," Ken Calvert, my California Republic, said.
The failures of Centcom's leadership are just up to the top of the organization.
The 10th-page report describes in detail the constant problems of the main station's description and analysis of the United States' efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the high-value administrative authorities in Obama's administration had set reports to be delineating, it describes the analysts as having put pressure on them to describe the threat caused by the Islamic state, Isisi, in a more positive light.
"In the first half of 2015, many press releases, opinions and certificates for Congress were much more positive than the events themselves", said the report.
For example, the Centcom Authority publicly stated that a major attack on the return of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in the hands of Isisi.
"After months' examination, this is very clear", said Mr. Mike Pompeo, the Republic of Kansas, in the opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, high-value intelligence officers in the US military area manipulated the main office's intelligence output to reduce the threat of Isisi in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a working group after hearing that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence from the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday follows more extensive results in the course of the investigation.
The Ministry of Defence Oversight has begun an additional, ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the members of the Parliamentary Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which were consistent with the conclusions of some Republican working group.
"Centcom, between 2014 and 2015, created an inseparablely isolated process for the intelligence assessment of the security forces of Isisi and Iraq," said Mr Adam B. Schiff, the leading representative of the Committee, said in the opinion.
According to Schiff, this process "supervised the publication of intelligence results" made the mood worse among analysts, not giving enough space for different perspectives".
Mr Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find evidence that the White House would have tried to pressure the analysts of Centcom to agree on its conclusion "pre-set or political statement".
On Tuesday, the Daily Beast will report the preliminary results of the Congress investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reports that the Pentagon Oversight Inspector has begun his investigation following the complaints of Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, representative of the Pentagon, said in the opinion that the Ministry of Defence does not comment on Congress report for as long as an inspector's investigation is under way.
But he said that "the experts disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential matters of national security".
There are also other consequences of the investigation than the question of whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria are successful (such as the increasing number of defence authorities now claiming).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can rely on the principal to act honestly on the military activities of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
The assessment of the Islamic state's intelligence is reflected in more than a decade ago, when Centcom's intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article saying that despite the objections of several analysts, President George W. Bush's government supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about what sanctions the 2003 attack would have.
Hooker was also in the key role in the rebellion regarding Islamic state intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker Group concluded that despite the opposite public statements, the air attacks against the refineries controlled by the Islamic State had not significantly undermined the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
However, the Times reported in September that this finding was not reported outside the headquarters.
The commander from Centcom's bridge, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was started to criticise last year, after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive assessment of war.
General Austin retired in April, and General Joseph L. Votel came to his replaced headquarters.
The United States will win the fourth time in a row at women's groundhockey, organising a mid-term review with Britain
The day after having scored three goals for the team winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam made Thursday the US women's mahockey team with the first two goals when the Americans won India's 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but a 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps a record of his paintings."
But he knows this: the Americans are in 4-0 situations at the Olympics tournament and they share their team first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after the victory of Japan on Thursday 2-0.
On Saturday, Britain and the United States will meet in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have survived the quarter, and this game will decide who will be the first and who will be the second of their six teams in their group.
The first place was to avoid a strong Dutch leader, the second group, at the beginning of a slightly longer quarter.
Whatever the end of the Saturday game, the Americans have raised their surprising success here, four years after they stayed at London Olympics for the last 12 teams.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Pennsylvania's Blue Bell and picked up groundhockeymail for the first time at the age of three (i.e. his parents played doubles in Drexel) in connection with the country team at the age of 16, when he became the youngest player of all time.
He was not involved in the Olympics in 2008, because he was unable to participate in the final player list.
In 2012, nothing was going on with him and his teammates.
The following year, the English Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Culture change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same working hours in London as we have now.
We've made a full translation.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half-time goal-making in the boxing area close to the goal.
India had come into the air with no profit in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly hard and maintained the situation in the 1-0 chapters until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then rolled into the middle of the ball and pulled the Americans into the 2-0 line.
Melissa Gonzalez added four times in the middle of the last goal.
This zero game was the first U.S. goalkeeper to Jackie Briggs, who had released one of the first three wins.
He's in good shape.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now", Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
The peace of trampolin in the middle of the Olympics
Whatever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are running.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable message of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic music itself is a flame-reflecting message capsule that is transmitted from the springmers to the swimmers and the gymnasts to the triathlonists.
It is impossible to put on television, read the newspaper, or listen to the guest's conversation in the cafe line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first time of the Olympic Games, and the future heartbreaker with a smile, could well be one of the names of all those known to be presented in the best viewing time, supported by sponsorships and TV advertising of good mind - if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordmaker.
But Dooley, 28 from the California Lake Forest, competes with the Olympic Games trampoliin.
The Olympics don't light all the species as much as they do.
Far from the middle, partly in the shadows, are the species that everyone does not generally accept: air-stamp, spring-stamp, feather-ball, taekwondo.
We always have a bra. Long live it.
But if I can make a fair number of my special favors, I would like to draw attention to the undermining force of trampolin.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic species since 2000, when it first appeared in Sydney, its presence has been so limited over the past 16 years that many of whom I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic species at all.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the species, it has never won the medal, and its athlete has not made it to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russian generally share the medals of men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie McLanna defend their gold medals in London.
Trampoliin, however, is associated with a certain kind of underdog’s charm, partly because it sounds more appropriate to the clown school than to the Olympic Games.
Here, I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just an inability fan.
The species have the opportunity to be amusing, as we can see from the coloring of the endless pebbles, but it also has the immersion of gymnastics and swimsuits, two species which, in principle, unite in it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means a pop-up board.
The champions of the championship jumped with a giant trampoliin up to almost 30 feet high, and they must carry out a hot series of business (turns, skills and volts) and finally land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and flight time.
32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women in Rio.
The most common Olympics are headed straight ahead.
A lot of hopers must go looking for gold, looking for more, faster, up and over... sometimes to the finish, sometimes around the field.
They are not only hunting the goal line or the start-up wall, but also, in television news, the second lassive border: the world or the Olympics.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatical, and it can even get a viewer on tears.
But that is also the reason why watching the competitions can be a little exhausting.
Trampoline offers a resting moment of this.
Trampolin's heading up.
The aim is not to move forward.
The contestant rises to a new rise, affecting himself as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then unscrupulously up again.
Of course, this does not affect competition or difficulty, but during the programme there is no fierce rush towards the end, no jumps to the distance, only the sleepy, melting interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to the state of zen as the Olympics can get.
Women's Karsin Competitions and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon at 13 (ET), men's competitions will also come on Saturday at 13.
NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon software starting at 14 a.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic mist, they offer a quiet, attractive moment that most likely does not notice in the general chaos.
And if awareness is achieved only by providing male athletes to be watched and exhibited (such as U.S. men's officers, some time ago proposed The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his negligent new fan.
"The generation shows his mind" in Ethiopia, a long-term ally of the United States.
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Political change has been faced by the violent opposition of the government by the protestors in Ethiopia.
Eyewives say that dozens of protestors have been shot to death in convents with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the last decade, it has been one of the most stable African states, the strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have been shaking the country into more and more areas.
One week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was unsatisfied.
The witnesses said that the police shot and killed dozens of non-armed protestors.
The videos recorded in demonstrations, which are believed to be at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, show how the security authorities beat young people with their hands at the same time as they were forced to stand against the wall.
The United Nations High Court of Human Rights now requires a comprehensive study.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together, and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most violent country in Africa after Nigeria, and Western countries appreciate its stability.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against the terrorist threats of the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much help from the Western countries.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital of Addis Ababa has even a new train for business travelers.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, despite the fact that Ethiopia has not been a model for democracy, human rights organisations have constantly talked about the repression of the government, the opposition of the country has been limited, and the dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported from the land, imprisoned, killed or driven far from the desert.
But this could be changing.
"If you suppress people, and they have no alternative but to show their mind, this is what will happen", Seyoum Teshome, the university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
The whole youth shows his mind.
One generation shows its mind.
The complaints are diverse and cover everything from land use to the curfew of the ruling coalition.
After the much criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last opposition, and now it holds all the seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the opposite border of Eritrea are growing, and the battle along this tight and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as Oromo Liberation Front or Ogade National Liberation Front, which have been more or less over the past few years, can try to re-establish and re-arm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why bitter emotions are now about to explode under the surface of years.
The first appears to be seemingly harmless: smartphones.
In the last few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more widespread and the Internet service has improved.
Even if the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people still have access to the location via hidden network brokers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they met for demonstrations.
Secondly, two of the largest ethnic groups, oroms and amhars, in Ethiopia are better engaged.
Oroms and amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time the Amharas, which come mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, were successful in politics and business, using oroms, many of which are Muslims and who live in the pits.
But this is changing, too.
"We're on our way towards organisation under one umbrella," said the organ director Multu Gemechu.
The greatest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromomia.
Many Amharas and Oroms think that Ethiopia is not well controlled by the Tigre people, which cover about 6% of the population and governs armed forces, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawin's loss.
Meles, former rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until he died of secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and to use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
"The government has no basic flaw like it," said the conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemaram Desaleg, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the North Ethiopia Tigre area, Hailemaram is from the south.
Analysts say that the security services controlled by the tigers do not trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bleeding.
On the previous occasion, Ethiopia was under such a boom in 2005, when thousands of people showed their mind about the elections which, according to analysts, seemed to be the first Hutilian government and then robbed them.
In the following step, many of the protesters died, though less than in the last few months, and that period of rest passed relatively quickly.
The development experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for the visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new road trip, and major progress in the fight against poverty.
However, this clearly has not stopped the weakening of the government of Ethiopia from within the country.
And now it's getting a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protestors in the city of Amhara, Gondar, attacked companies owned by tigers, and the hatred against Tigre becomes more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that protests put the United States and the other Western allies in a position of clumsy.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for aircraft flying to Somalia, although some time ago it said that it had closed down this base.
Although the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want their ally in the unstable region to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "there's real balance."
Donald Trump explains Obama's basic-Isisi-sent as "serkasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress his most recent campaign over a disputes on Friday, claiming that he wasn't really the one when he had several times this week, saying that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "basics" of the Islamic terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defender, who has been piling up to defend him during a stormy period, in a difficult position where they need to explain the comments he does not necessarily mean.
After the tip of the campaign meeting this Wednesday, Trump was increasingly keen to say that Isisi was created by President and Clinton in the interviews on Thursday.
However, in the Twitter edition of the early Friday morning, Trump said that he was just sarcastic.
The publication was a complete version of the previous day, when Trump said that he was really serious about the accusation in several interviews.
When the conservative journalist Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trumpic make his remark by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy Isisi, the Republican presidential candidate took this hearing of his ears.
The most recent crisis comes in a situation where Trump has tried to refocus its campaign in the midst of the results of the opinion polling into the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back on the subject again.
Returning to Twitter again, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he thought it was boring.
Trump's used sarcasm defense before.
Later in July, after he faced a broad criticism apparently when proposing that Russians should hack Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "I am certainly sarcastic".
The approach will enable Trump to go within the limits of political speech and then return if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he testes certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'interprets' in the direction or depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is very wise about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to filter them through several lenses.
Instead of relieving his speech for a large public vote, Trump has been more suppled over the last few days when his popularity has continued to fall.
A new, published NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey showed that Trump was found to be very close to Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
Although Trump, as a rule, tends to avoid apologizing for what he says about provocative things, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding their words or misunderstanding their sense of humor.
When he faced with an ever closer examination of the presidential campaign during the last few months, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal ally to an unpleasant position in which they must publicly support him, regardless of how provosive his remarks are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, one of Trump's most significant supporters, was in great trouble defending the candidate for CNN's interview on Thursday.
"I believe that his words have real political comments," Giulian said when he was asked about the accuracy of Trump's argument, which led Obama and Clinton to establish the Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization which he called an amateur, totally wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most authorities are trying to argue that the Obama government, in which Clinton worked as Minister for Foreign Affairs, let Is get worse because it failed to effectively deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before Pennsylvania's Friday meetings Trump continued his attack on Twitter on the news media, which yaw his every word and are neutral against him.
He mocked "good, pathetic" TV experts trying to figure him out, saying, "They can't do it!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse for being new evidence that he was not fit to be president.
Previously closed coffee shop will return to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a lawnmower, only a cashy acceptable place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the streetside of Bedford Avenue was too expensive for him.
A movement that replaced Verb in summer 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cup-shaped soaps.
It was the last loss of the locals in a middle - class sane city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if there's a change in New York, it's also a redesign.
Last November, the retired Verb opened up to Greenpoint, under a mile of its original location.
There's a wifi in the new Verb and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff still have the same, and there's the same unprepared atmosphere.
The coffee's still good, too.
New Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, the long-term employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started at Verb in 2001, and he was there until the end.
When the customer offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought the same espresso.
It even used old Verb's lights.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it too.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu includes peony egg egg cheese soups, and the coatings are available for example capers and brown onion.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
There's no more beer in the coffee shop, but fresh juices are made there.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he's discovered a steady current for old customers.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers," he said.
One last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was a customer of this kind.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After he moved to Greenpoint, he went to the cafe.
He says when Verb closed, he gave up the coffee drink for a second.
"I understood that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he's back on coffee, even though that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his regular coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He used to go there before work, and he always made the same order.
"Every day, fifteen past seven, on a regular basis, I went in and they were preparing my spiced bagels with butter," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to do some experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today Rosenthal is still making his usual order, but sometimes because of his variation, he has room for a spiced bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't wear a grudge for a soap shop that took over the old ones.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special ticket for Verb to use as an ingredient coffee in a cold coffee shop.
"I think we can still grab the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted a cafe.
One of these new customers turned the menu half, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to make it appear soon to something to make his new neighbours feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle up and sell a cold coffee.
It is possible that the cafe will extend to the next building.
Many customers have enough to get their old favorites in new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a client and said that it was comforting when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whit said he felt like he was coming home walking in and ordering coffee.
"I needed to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: laxative food
In March 1933, soon after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office room.
President Roosevelt liked fine Fifth Avenue dishes, such as a haystack, and Maryland's Finnish turtle soup.
On that day, his diet was more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato sauce, and dessert from the bonemeal.
"It was an indication of culinary solidarity for people who suffer," Jane Ziegelman said.
His spouse Andrew Coe added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coen's latest book, Chop Suey, told me about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told me about life in Lower East Side through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, which Harper publishes on Tuesday, is historic of American food during the greatval season of the 1930s.
By showing some kind of own culinary solidarity, they meet the supplier at dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, in a small, unprepared lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been active since the collapse of the stock market in 1929.
Zigelman, 54, ordered fresh cheese olive bread, and Coe, 57, took the dose with turkey, potato salt and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating a lay-off.
"The coins were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut scrape, no liver fracture, no beans.
They were made of a manufacturing material and some poor ingredient that continued the actual manufacturing material.
Imagine eating so much peanuts that they'd make up your dinner.
Coe's loose.
"It must have felt like lead in the stomach," he said.
Years before the lay of the American tables, especially in rural areas, there was an eating-so-so-so-as-you-you-you-you-can-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-dooo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doooo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-o-o-o-o-oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo-ooooo-o-o-o-o-ooooooo
Women’s groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pies were served with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The Americans sent food to those starving Europeans during World War I. The Square Meal book was crowned by the ways that the nation survived that it suddenly was no longer a land of abundance.
"The food at that time became a central, distressing theme for the Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The same distressing was the new, affordable diet: Mysterious dishes, such as worries and boxes, became the main dishes, and the box was "a powerful way to use the food stars", mentioned Ziegelman, because cooks could hide less attractive ingredients under the creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
The meat, which had been at the center of the American meals for years, became a sustainable luxury product.
Special ingredients were tried with calories and nutrient content more important than taste or even healthy senses in the kitchen.
When the study was also carried out for a book containing recipes, Ziegelman prepared an era of food, where roasted onions were filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "It was unreal."
The peanut butter doesn't fit the roasted onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the federal household office in 1923-1943, directed the country’s eating habits more than ever before or after.
In the press and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgets" and to respond to the challenge of turning muskets such as the tampons and carrots into delicious doses.
The Square Meal is a celebration of historical taste parties.
Particularly tasty are reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, let me eat your cake position.
At the same time, when he publicly praised his childhood with simple, Iowa’s country food, he ate like a sophisticated millionaire who had become.
"He liked mannerous food, like fish with sour sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tuxedo on his head in a almost golden dining room.
He was the greatest out there for everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, would have encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As reported in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in sleeping, the White House became a place that "only one of Washington's anchors, but also the most direly prepared food."
Many of the low - age eating habits were rejected as soon as the land got back on its feet.
The tradition is our constant concentration on calories and nutrients, Ziegelman said, and in the way that science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they reached a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother, such as how she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid to waste food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "He even got sick."
There's been a windmill incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: a bluish meal, which President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a bonnet", Ziegelman said adding that the common trick was to give a name that looked like small recipes.
There was no cream in the dessert, but only plums, a little flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone was unwittingly sinking their spoons into a sticky, brown lister.
Well, I guess it wasn't bad.
Coe once and the other one.
Speaking of a positive budgeter, he told his wife that "a lot of bloated German nuts could help."
Gilead will be replaced by legal expenses in the hepatitis C patent fight against Merck
The U.S. Court has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive legal expenses incurred in the dispute against Merck & Co Inc, a pharmaceutical manufacturer for hepatitis C.
In June, Gilead was released from the payment of $200 million after they broke two Merck patents associated with Gilead’s success medications in Sovald and Harton. This release followed when a US judge found Merck’s abuses, including false oaths and other ethical practices.
In the judgment of Thursday, the U.S. court judge, Beth Labson Freeman, said that Gilead is entitled to be exempt from the compensation it suffered in response to the action.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which controls the market by a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can improve clearly more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case will take place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck appealed against the ownership of laboratory work on the basis of the active substance sofosbuvir in Gilead.
The U.S. armed forces say that they have fully taken over Manbij, controlled by Isisi.
The troops supported by the United States have fully taken over the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, since the last remaining Isis fighters left town, the group representative said on Friday.
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last team of fighters hidden in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 winged hostages that the fighters held captive from the Sharfan Darwish SDF Alliance, Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"The office is now fully under our control, but we have begun to examine it," he told Reuters.
Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2% of federal taxes.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published his tax declaration for 2015, which showed that the democratic presidential candidate and his spouse's income in that year were $10.75 million and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charity organisations, mainly the Clinton Foundation, the former President Bill Clinton made nearly $ 5.3 million in speech compensation, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster, who reported his career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The vice-president of Clinton, Senator Tim Caine from Virginia, published ten years of tax returns with his wife Anne Holton.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine set a standard for economic transparency," says Jennifer Palmieri, campaign assistant, Clinton.
As a sharp contrast to this Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his earlier promises of publishing his tax returns.
According to the custom, U.S. Presidential candidates publish their tax returns even though the law does not oblige them.
A New York businessman, Trump and his lawyers, have appealed to the tax administration's audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
"Your turn," Ian Sams, Clinton's campaign assistant, said on Twitter when he published a link to the tax returns of the democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audit is complete.
Trump's critics, including the Presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans of 2012 have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business and several other ties, for example, to Russia.
Clinton has taken up the problem on Friday, with a video published on the Internet, bringing out prominent Republicans calling for Trump to publish its taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every candidate in the last decades has made: published his tax return," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the two 1990s, and the New York Times Business College borrowed a number of taxpayers and accountants who said that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax percentages have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire Buffett that would make sure that more than a million dollars per year earn at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At the Clinton meeting in Nebraska Oman last week Buffett, whom the Berksshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, appealed to Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he also had an inspection of the tax administration, and that Trump did not "fear" the tax collection agency, but the voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The actual federal tax rate for Clintons living in New York Chappaqua was around 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40,5 per cent.
The Clinton tax declaration for 2015 showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment site was low, the indexed investment fund, and Clinton reported dividends and interest income of USD 109 000.

Chili powder condoms and raisins enhance the welfare of Tanzania
Natural protectors in Tanzania use an unusual way to prevent elephants from walking to human premises - they throw animals in canned condoms filled with chili powder.
Keino has proved effective, and several years ago, the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the American Nature Conservancy, has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of Northern Denmark to use an inhumanly four steps in the way of protecting home and hundreds without the animals being injured.
In the past, many used the spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the world's elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
Since we developed... the tools, we have discovered a change of attitude in these communities, and they are now much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them," said the Honeygue Executive Director Damian Bell in the opinion.
The first two steps keep an intruder on the pocket lamp and the ringing of the horn.
If it doesn't stop an animal, the so-called chili cloud will be thrown.
The condom shall be filled with chilli powder and earth blended with both smoothness, after which the condom shall be twisted in such a way that only the ignition thread remains visible.
When the condom is set on fire, it breaks out with a bang and purifys chilli powder dust into the air.
One smell is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last thing you do is a trigger that shoots a Roman candle in the air.

A French, Jewish-based filmmaker was released after the media storm revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli direction number. According to the employee, this is due to requests from the Arabic people.
Claude Lanzmann, a document film about Holokaus, had his frustration at the Berlin-based Kempinski Bristol Hotel, writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find an Israeli hotel in the country's indicative number list.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries that could be called directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital city of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
On the other hand, Kampinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through his own telephone centre.
When looking for an explanation, the filmmaker took this up at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer that was received from there was that of him.
The hotel's recipeist said it was "the thought-out decision of the management of the Kampinski hotels".
The reason behind the decision was even more shocking in the filmmaker.
"The part of our guests is Arabs, and they demand the removal of the Israeli directional number," the employee is said to have said Lanzmann.
The German Ambassador of Israel Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case "great injustice", Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were horrified and shocked because of the incident.
It's a big mistake in itself.
But even greater shame is the fact that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident produced quite a reaction online when people called it scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "supervised" for the alleged demands of the Arabic people.
The second publication noted that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street is standing near the synagogue.
The hotel itself denied all charges quickly and called it "indelibility" as well as "seriously sorry" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reporting.
"The original order is not to include Israel in the quick selection list," says Kempinski's representative according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the direction number has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students
On Thursday, the students met with the police in Sao Paulo, Brazil, when the students met to show their views on government public education reforms.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to break down the student group, which led to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express horror about plans.
According to the proposals made by Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin of the State of Sao Paolo, little less than 100 public schools would be closed and 300 000 students would be reinvested in order to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstrations were seen writing up the walls of the temporary president Michel Temer's anti-gravitational graffiti.
This most recent demonstration took place only days after the protestors left as a group to support President Dmalma Rousseffi in voting for his office in the country's Senate.
RTbusiness: trade between Russia and Iran is growing suddenly by 71%
Since the removal of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, says the Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the international sanctions against Iran left, Russian companies have largely demonstrated their interest in transactions in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing links with Iran, while the new companies are ready to enter the market.
"In fact, one of the most important objectives of Iran's bilateral cooperation is to expand trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He pointed out that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent from the same period in 2015 to a total of EUR 856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran increased by 91.5%, with a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to 158 million dollars.
"The growth of the closet was achieved by the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
In addition, Dzhagaryan is expecting a record of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, about 35,000 visas were granted to Iranian citizens by the Russian foreign representatives in Iran mainly for travel.
Iran was also the first among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia.
"It is safe to say that last year's record of the Iranians in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, the ambassador hopes to change.
"I can personally recommend a visit in the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi. They have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Skott Callum Skinner hit the finish line of the British as he caught the bike gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner was honoured at the men's team in Rio's cycling stadium last night, while the British team's three men were defending their championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role of Sir Chris Roy, where his Scottish colleague was restored, the legend was proud of the young man when he got into the goal by taking the victory over the team in New Zealand.
Britain took shock four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the temple with a modest sixth position in the World Championships of March in London, even though Hoy has subsequently decided his race.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's ending also created a vacuum that Kia Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man from whom British coaching held close to the stot potential that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner made an Olympic performance in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British triangle won a duel of gold.
After his own tour, the Hindus were on top of him, but Kenny put a gun on the team, and Skinner held it on.
The change in strategy was a large part of the transformation, and it included Hindes driving at a major turn to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to hold on to pace.
Hoy followed his position as an expert at BBC and drew the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the award course.
The 23-year-old Glasgowlainen Skinner said, "Walking is flattered."
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
In the final, we did an Olympic play and won the world champions.
I can't believe it.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning London in 2012, alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments and the British competitors did not complain.
This time, there was no such problem with the overpower gain.
Hindes said, "It felt like she was in London when she had so many British tickets on her feet."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world stars, so winning the Olympics again is simply wonderful.
One event, one gold medal for the people, who won seven out of ten rides in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we'll be waiting for a successful five-day cycling stadium.
According to Kenny's condition, it is impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's career, winning three Olympics at the Olympics.
That would mean that Kenny - which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (that is seen on the holy day of British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday) - the total amount of medals would rise to six gold and one silver.
It's like Hoy's.
Kenny's gonna race for the next sprint that starts today and lasts for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I've only had one of these now.
Team race is always the best.
We'll win it together with our friends.
To win alone is honestly lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given a knight's worth."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in time for four lives, four miles in a row.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record, which won gold in London, is 3:51:659.
The first round and the finals (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time periods when the officials called him for a long measure.
In a similar competition for women, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavi Katie Archibald made progress during the world record at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its awesome bike team will take over the Olympic Games middle and reach the entire set of medals.
After a truly exceptional and complete leadership in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced before the Rio race.
The background has been drama, the least of which have not been the difference between the technical leader Shane Sutton in April due to sexual and temptation charges, and the end of the race for large people such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
On the basis of the first night’s competitions, however, the cycling stadium seems to have the legendary reputation of Britain now rising to its peak at a perfect moment again.
The future of Portland's molten future due to a questionable operation of the electricity contract
The future of Portland Victoria's aluminium alloy, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain when the electricity-sharing electricity company revealed that one company's owners are about to conclude a distribution agreement, so all distribution contracts are expected to be cut.
The measure follows the decision of the Victorian administration this year that the aid for the operation of the plant will not be continued.
The aid amount for the 20-year period will expire in November.
Even 2000 jobs may be in danger at the Alcoan Portland factory.
Even 2000 jobs may be in danger, either directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition, the snowball effect can be possible, as the fuse uses about 10 % of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's fuse, which led to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
The Alcoan Portland melter loses money and is under the closure.
The measure is now following several years of speculation on the future of the factory, which began as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the cost of production of the plant.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium spray from the Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it was also waiting for the three other owners to decide on their contract.
Most of the factory is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL is waiting for the operation of the Portland plant to continue, which means that the physical electricity demand of the molten plant will continue," he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are the so-called 'protection agreements', which had to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a 12 month notice period, so they will expire in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects contracts to produce results in the year 2017," said the electricity company.
All potential performance effects for AGL from the financial year 2018 are currently limited by strong prospects for the future electricity wholesale market.
AGL said that it has already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the agreements "not to affect Alcoa's ... ability to keep melting in operation or to secure the power supply of the fuse".
The US company said that it concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the agreement had to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why the agreement was withdrawn.
Analysts have been on guard both because of the instigation of Portland in Victoria and the possible closure of the Tomagon plant near Newcastle, as the economic situation in this sector is poor.
Previously, Stephen Mikkelsen, CEO of AGL, said to analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If both plants are removed from the market, this is a significant reduction in demand for [electric] markets.
As an electricity producer to us, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just the true-tv star of Kardashians, is on the September Vogue deck.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manageer Kris Kardashian-Jenneri clan's fourth daughter, is on the cover of the United States of America's desired September number.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand-teller and has been a model for Milan, Paris and New York fashions, reported news on Thursday in his Instagram account.
"Seeing this cover in a room full of dear people made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover poster was followed by a unique (or perhaps just the Kardashian style?), a handwritten reality video, where the whole Kardashian-Jenneri clan (excluding trouble cases Rob and Caitly, with all the favorite entertainments, Keeping Up's producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his sister's cover, but who ended up in a classic turn: they were planning a surprise party.
This is the cliché of almost every children's television series, the cliché of the 'born' period (Seacrest says the words 'you didn't think we'd forget about the credibility of the morning-created costume), but Krisin had to somehow get his other girls to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved to the new era of Kardashians with the place of Vogue in September.
Kendall's isossko Kim may have reached Vogue's application first (i.e. he shared it with Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue is entirely in its own category.
The number of Vogue's September is the most selling edition of the whole year.
Its thickness reminds more of a coffee table book than a fashion paper, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion decreased that last year's 832-page study 615 was advertising content).
Its cover star is so highly expected that for the last two years, pictures of the newspaper have been leaking before official publication.
Former women on deck have been from Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss, among other things.
In recent years, there have indeed been more 'public people who act as models' than 'models that are famous'.
The Oscar winner and Dior's Ambassador Jennifer Lawrence were on record in 2013, after Lady Gagan's honor.
But if it were the case that Jenner, described as his generation's "resurrection model", would hit his first category, he's pretty good at company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or to modern youths who can make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of this).
They are rightly gifted women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has been one of the strongest years of his career with Lemonade's publication.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner's success.
His real-tv history of Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be tobacco.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret Model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and this colleague Gigi Hadidi by calling them "this moment of the year".
This feeling got up again with Jenner Vogue.
But in dissatisfaction, spinning is not appropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He's a super model in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Este Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters will sell you pictures of themselves in their own applications found behind the payout.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter who he took for the LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, he's a real-life star.
Community legal centres turn 160 000 people away annually
More than 160 000 people will be turned from the Community legal centres each year when the sector is preparing for the impact of additional financial cuts on its activities at its borders.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly from the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who do not have the opportunity to fight against unfair decisions and similar ones - are already turned away in their search for legal advice and representation.
Legal services already taken to the extremes of the Community are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres are supposed to lose 30% of their federal funding.
According to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres report, thousands of people are now turned away annually.
Farrell said that if the decision of the federal government is not withdrawn, the situation would only get worse.
"Queensland's legal centres are chronically underfinanced, which means that thousands of people are turned away annually from the essential services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relations with unmanageable and corrupting debts, families in the settlement, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not receive the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents will have to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on both the Justice Minister and Senator George Brandis to immediately withdraw these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the government of the state made its promise to increase the financing of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community judicial centre and their customer communities, and the Government of Palaszczu must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after the employee was alleged to be under threat.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for not doing anything after they were told that the campaign's head of action in North Carolina threatened the armed worker in February when they were driving Jeep.
The incident was described as the former software intern of the state campaign, Vincent Bordin, on Wednesday at the State Court in Charlotte.
Bordini said that he waited months to discuss the situation internally until he realized that "it would not happen".
Chief Earl Phillip "stealed the pistol, put his right front finger on the trigger and pushed the pipe against Vincent's kneecap," Bordin said on the cover.
Having elected to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four other persons had similar experiences with Phillip, a complaint was made.
"There's no need to launch cases to cause damage," Bordin said on the cover.
The challenge will come only two days after the Republican presidential candidate was upset when he told the public in North Carolina that "the people of another addition", which would normally be understood by gun owners and gunmen, could take action if his competitors, Hillary Clinton, were elected and had a choice of judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media has taken away his word from the context and that he is not in favour of violence.
Bordin’s challenge is to seek compensation from the campaign for carefree supervision and for violence, abuse and emotional repression by Phillip.
Mr Trump's representative, Hope Hicks, did not reply immediately to the request for a comment.
The attempts to reach Phillip didn't work.
WCB, local newsgirl in Charlote reports Phillip has recently left the campaign.
The call request submitted to his consultant for Innovative Consulting Services was not immediately answered.
The Republican presidential campaign, Donald Trump, has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the Olympics' lives and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings the whole stomach back and forth, not only to local communities and different parts of London.
For myself, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was the charm of London’s 2012 races, when we saw a great deal of effort to ensure that all our people and regions benefit from the race.
The Olympics had enormous benefits for Stratford and East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Ten 000 new places of training and 40 000 new jobs are created for local communities alone and youth unemployment is removed from the airport.
Just as before the London 2012 race, some will think that the challenge of extending Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the race and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they're gonna be wrong about Heathrow.
There is always a way to overcome these obstacles, but Heathrow will answer every question that is put to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not only for the few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and 211 billion pounds of economic growth, as well as to leave the heritage of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has completed 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment program with time and budget: from the T5 that has been voted the world's best airport terminal in five years to T2, built between the two fastest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to implement the third runway, supported by 16 billion.
The London Olympic Games in 2012 were a great success for Britain, and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow is also one of them.
It is time to channel the lives of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a heritage of skills and employment, from which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is the president of Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Prevention of advertising in Adblock Plus and Facebook Cat and Mouse
For companies that receive money from online advertising, the anti-promoting program is "the cat and the mouse", said one of the companies that manufacture this kind of program.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertising inhibitors from using their websites, Adblock Plus published a blog article saying that users could update the program filters to prevent advertising on social network pages again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its website code was exchanged around advertisements to make it more difficult for advertisers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's been going around a new code.
In the blog article, Ben Williams of Adblock wrote that "a similar fight between an open source advertising community and its curators has been taking place since the discovery of advertising prevention", and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of the great grief of the advertisers who have come to industry.
Globally, about 200 million are used by advertisers, reported in the last year's Pagefair and Adobe study. This is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook's advertising revenues.
However, the company is behind the advertisers on the computer, since mobile advertisers do not operate on Facebook mobile applications for the social network or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer advertising is still producing enough income to allow Facebook to view this type of activity as an investment.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said that it would update its "minoscism" tool in order to give people more power about how advertisements are being targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying, as they would also prevent part of the site's non- advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem", said Facebook's representative in the e-mail report.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we instead focus on building tools such as Ad Preferences that give control to people.
The woman got hit by a car on the Swiss motorway, apparently because of suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses after the woman stayed on the highway for several vehicles under Thursdays early in the case of suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 road near Morges at Vaud's canon just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman made a "inconclusive act" and settled in the dark on the road to which several vehicles were hit, the Vadi police said in the opinion.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman with several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers who are involved in the event have already been interviewed, but not all have been identified, the police, who appeals to them and all witnesses who have witnessed the incident, have already reported.
Crime investigation has been initiated, which is a " logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstutter told Le Tribune de Genevelle.
"But let us see if any of the involved drivers are indicted.
Was it possible to avoid collision?
It's going to be settled by the prosecutor," Hofstitter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held liable.
In both cases, where both were the person who walked in the dark motorway, it was estimated that drivers could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, said the magazine.
Last year, the police were released from charges in respect of the death penalty after he was hit and killed by a man lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had gone down the road, he was told.
The Court stated that the police, which was responding to the emergency call, were in a justified way, and that the man’s presence on the road was “a very exceptional and unpredictable situation,” said the judge.
Anyone with information on Thursday's case near Morges must call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus once had to live
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was likely to be once.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus's past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine if Venus would have a hot, waterless surface and if it could sometimes have been earthlike conditions.
Scientists have previously stated that Venus’s slow rotation rate explains its thick atmosphere.
But the most recent simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, underground atmosphere, and still could have rolled slowly.
The model also looked at the formation of the early Venus surface.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the earth, but once there was enough water and a geographical variation to enable life and to protect the rapid desolation of water.
The advantage of the early Venus was also 30% more darker sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals its sunside for almost two months at a time," the GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in the news.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud that acts as a umbrella of the surface of the shields for a large part of the sun’s heat.
As a result, average air temperature is actually a few degrees colder than the Earth's present.
The model produced a story similar to what the planetists had previously assumed from Venus’s development.
Even though Venus was likely to be inhabited sometimes, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans faded and its water vapours burned in the ultraviolet light.
When it ran away, only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with its deadly greenhouse gas phenomena, Venus, which we now know.
Researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geographic Research Letters publication.
Patrick Roy's giving up Avalanche coach's laundry.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the activities of Coach Colorado Avalanche and Vice-President of the hockey affairs, namely, due to the lack of influence on the team's decision-making process.
Mr. Colorado's Vice President/President Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have made my duty as Deputy Director-General of the Ice Rocks of Colorado Avalanche and head coach with zeal, passion and determination", says Roy, 50 years old.
During the summer, I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it the depth needed and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the Vice-President of the Coach and the Vice-President for hockey must be fully in line with the organisation's view.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not being met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him luck in the future.
Roy was appointed to the top coach Jack Adams Award in the first period of Avalanchen 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the middle division to victory, but Minnesota knocked down Colorado in the first round, and the team has not been able to continue in the last two years.
Avalanchen's games in the period 2015-16 ended with 39 winnings, 39 losings, and 4 reels, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing the wild card slot of the West Conference.
Hall of Fame selected goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups - two both in Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and delay strike
The employment struggles of oil workers in the North Sea are postponed due to wages, when all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
The strike oil-field service company against Wood Group has been randomly organized by Royal Dutch Shell in Northern Sea drilling trucks.
"Wood Group, as well as Unit and RMT associations, can confirm that we have agreed to re-establish a process aimed at a solution to the current dispute", read the joint opinion.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several meetings all day early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent fight against work, which they say to be the first over 25 years of age, was an objection to possible wage cuts, up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group cut the commissions of North Sea contractors by around 9 % due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the remuneration of the company follows a reduction of 10 % for the year 2014.
The company said that the additional cuts would give the company the necessary room for entry to cope with the decline in the market.
Shell has reduced thousands of people in its paylist and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries when the company reduces its operations as a result of its giant merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by the British June decision to leave the European Union.
Mr Dave Anderson met with federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest working practices in the North Sea for one generation.
He said the North Sea is essential to the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, not only for the few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country", he said in the opinion.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than USD 1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average of the previous five years has been around USD 7 billion.
Kepler measure the speed of the stars in the Pleads Star Force
The last task of Kepler's apocalypse is to help astronomers collect the most complete list of the speeds of the stars of the Pleads.
The new data will help the astronomers understand why the stars of the pack run at varying speeds, and how the orbits relate to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other Stargates, we will now learn more about the relationship between mass, its age and even the history of its solar system", researcher Luisa Rebull said in the press release
The Pleijad's Stargate is located in 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars were born about 125 million years ago, and are just about to reach adulthood.
They're running high-level now.
At high speed, these adult stars are falling in large quantities from the sun.
When these winds pass through the stars' magnetic fields, they control the stars.
When the stars get old, the speed of rotation starts to slow down.
Kepler measure the speed of rotation for each star by monitoring the appearance of identifiable star drops, such as sunlight.
The list of the latest stars' speeds suggests that the more mass-intended stars spin slower than the less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, the bigger make the devils slower than the smaller ones.
"In the Balet of the Peljads," we see that the fucking spinners are usually more massive, whereas the fastest spinners are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the Pleads Star Force is so close, it is ideal for a cosmic laboratory to evaluate the star properties of the stars at rotation speeds.
"The stars of the Peljads offer an anchor to the theoretical models of the spinning of stars that cover both the legs, the younger and the older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why stars slow down their speeds and so-called, they hang their 'tances' on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Plejad's rotational speeds in three articles that will soon be published in the Astronomic Journal.
