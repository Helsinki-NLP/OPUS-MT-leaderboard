Tom is one of the best singer I've ever heard.
We've been studying French for three years.
Mary has a good-cut husband.
Tomi's just pretending for a while.
It was a storm and the snow began to crawl through and out on the road.
I think you're doing a very good job.
There's a problem.
It seemed the day was in one place.
Who thinks so?
You're not gonna put them next to you by assault.
Tom's fishing too.
Tom's nose started itching.
Tom bought Mary a drink.
The young woman was so beautiful that even the devil wanted to marry her.
I missed my bus.
I'm gonna put a cap on my mouth so I don't talk anything out.
We have to act now.
Shall I take you home?
Tom is hopeless.
Have you committed a violation of the law?
I'm not the coach.
It's very boring.
It's too cold for swimming.
My hobby is collecting old games.
Tomi had to rest.
Mary's pregnant.
I teach Chinese.
Sometimes that's what it is.
Can I have it?
The flower I saw in the park yesterday was a reflex.
Everything happened lightning fast.
I've satisfied Tomi.
We have a cloudy day.
We tried to warn them.

His faith is strong.
He's studying history at the university.
He used her.
He likes to tear off the electrical devices.

They love my mom.
I don't have time to talk.
Don't forget to write to me.

Where do you live in Turkey?
Blue looks good on you.
Who did you go there with?
The design of the theatre enabled the audience to get close to the performers and to establish a relationship.
I couldn't move my arms.
Excuse me, can you help me?
I can understand.
Can you hold on for a few minutes?
Five hundred books, I'm sure.
Have the mailman been here yet?
That helps a little.
It was a wonderful day.
When are you getting married?
You've been trying to call Thomas Mária many times.
Let go of the handle.

She's a music teacher.
My mother measured my fever.
Please follow me.
Get out!
Did I make a mistake?
Tom was pale.
She's wonderful.
I know.
I appreciate what Tom did for me.
Tomi's happy she's finished.
Why are you climbing up that tree?
He led me to the palace.
There's a woman who wants to talk to you.
They told him to stand up and he did it.
It's the brownie.
We respect them very much.
How do I get to the airport?
Tom's doing almost anything for money.
You need a good rest.
We have a nice day.
All you have to do is work harder.
That smells good.
We need a change.

Can you turn on the light?
He was warned not to be late for school again.
I was looking for the key.
Tom saw it.
It's all clear!
Where did you stay in Boston?
Tom was walking.
His main charm lies in his character, not in his books.
Every car in this garage is Tomie's.
That sentence is too long!
What's he giving you the gold ring for?
History is written by winners.
He's a lawyer.
I wish you hadn't looked like you were having a really good time.
Would you like to have dinner with me?
I'd love to write hundreds of sentences on Tatoeban, but I'm busy.
I'll pay you later.
Tomi needed water.
I work every day except Sunday.

You don't have to try.
Tom put his money in the bank.
Tom was big.
There's always room for repair.
Tom was hit hard.
This should be prohibited.
There's no alcohol in the university area.

I respect Tomi.
It's all dark outside.
Have you heard from him lately?
We'll be waiting for three hours.
Apparently, Tom was late because he was a traffic jam on the 19th.
Tom, how did he respond?
Your profession is a dentist.
This is Uncle Tom's farm.
Good night, Mom.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I can't imagine getting married.
Everyone says food in this restaurant is very good.
Do you know what your children eat?
Looks like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Mari likes children.
The team will be ready.
Then I wasn't prepared for it.

What was the problem?
It's basically your fault.
Let's eat slowly.
One of the twins is alive, but the other one is dead.
You can email me the file.
We need help up here.
Sunday is free of charge.
Tom hid the evidence.
Stay away!
I warned Tom.
The dog was dead.
I never heard him lie.
We didn't know which train they were coming with.

Mari's refurbished a house.
I wish I hadn't seen such a horrible movie.
I read this story in some book.
Please spell your name.
Sorry I'm late.

He's got a lot of history books.
Don't give me anything.
Mild exercise stimulates blood circulation.
It's all right in the office.
Would you like some orange juice?

Can you do this yourself?
Tom said he didn't see anything.
Take an aspirin.
She's at school.
Are you deliberately trying to confuse me?
I volunteered.
Tom will answer all your questions.
You'll need an alibi.
You locked yourself out.

Why worry about it?
I had beer last night.

These are the things I like.
No one can see it.

I love to speak Spanish.
You didn't have the right to do that.
It's too easy for him.
He didn't like my answer.

God will help us.
Remember that.

Can you please tell me where you put the key?
I can do it.
We'll be there.
Thomas is the leader of the group.
That's what I want.
I have to convince Tom.
I don't think they like me.
Tomi was very excited.
From now on, I didn't intend to live in a big town.
Tom has rabbits.
Tom always leaves his bike dirty.
I can't just leave.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That day my life changed.
People are part of nature?

Tell Tomi I'll be back.
Get out of here!
Someone broke the glass.
Tom, you're open.
The boy held a mouse in his hand by his tail.

Let's hope not.
Your French knowledge has improved a lot.

I think all fat people should be dieting.
What should we do first?
Tomi's coming over this afternoon?
Can you suggest another time?
I gave up too early.
What are you gonna do there?
It's perfectly normal.
What else?

Your work is done.
I want to pay you now.
I'd like to ask you something.
I answered the question.
Mary solved the mystery.

How can I stop Tom?

Tom's party was a huge success.
Tom was naked.
We saw a castle in front of us.

They do the same things I did when I was a kid.
That's great.
I fell off the ladder.
Mary left for your fitness class.
The report was prepared in a hurry and a number of spelling errors were in it.

I'm looking for something to eat.
He can't stop me.
I learned so much about Tom.
I need a job now.
Everyone's still asleep.
Dog surgery.
Tom decided to go home early.
That was our biggest problem.
You're very kind.
I'm deaf, too.
I'm so proud of my team.
Sit down.
I don't know where I am.
Tom didn't do anything.
He's very proud of his talent.
Have you ever lived a long-term relationship?
All passengers were delivered from the plane.
I need a red pen.
He didn't know what to do with the problem.

I love Occitan.
I see what you're thinking.
There are things to do.
Tell him you love him before it's too late.
Can you lend me the book when you're done with it?

The rain became even more intense.
Tom's doing that to everyone.
Are you logged in?
We'll change that soon.
I don't want to talk about weather.
My request was rejected.
We were surprised to hear the news.
Don't underestimate yourself.
I'm Antonio.
This is where I met my friend.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I like torturing Tomi.
Tomi is our son.
He's a stranger.
You don't know the truth.
Tomi also makes the most critical comment.
Believe it or not, that's the truth.
I went without him.
He loves his brother.
Where else would we go?
If you don't like this, you can go.
Tom's gonna pay.
I see.
Tom was bored.
I don't want to meet him.
Help yourself if you want anything to eat.
Dad's still in bed.
Do you have to work on Sundays?
We got divorced with a good feeling.
We haven't had a problem yet.

You're going there without me.
Tom's gonna starve.
It's not a secret.
I was wrong about that.
Buy me, please.
We'll do it together.
Can you help me, please?
She saw Mary smile.
Hurry up and reach the eight-hour train.
They looked at him as a hero because he saved his friend's life.

Sometimes my dream comes true.
He spent all the money I gave him.
We were neighbors.
Do you think I should tell Tom?
What's that worth for you?
Do you know how to do this?

How old is your tat?
I don't have a nickname.
Who loves Tomi?
Kill Tom.
I think I'm dying.
What's that about?
Tom has a scratch on his forehead.
We're cool.

Everything has a limit.
Don't be smart.
You're gonna pay for this!

I hate lawyers.
Tom said you hate dancing.
If you have time, why don't you look in your gallery?
I was nervous at first, but then I gradually calmed down.
I don't want to buy this kind of couch.
You have to ask Tom first.
Explain it to me.
I'm aware of the difficulties.
I'm not sick.
Where are you from, Karen?
He was frozen somewhere in the mountains.

Can you wait a second?

I work as a bus driver.
I think you know him.
That's enough.
We didn't have dinner.
I finally got you.
I'm gonna give Tom the message.

Tom was supposed to do a lot better.
What songs were they singing?
I'm going home to Boston.
Already or not?
Mr. Harrison was sitting in his fingertip on a high-end veranda and smoking his evening pipe.
I don't want to study French today.
Tom's very unorthodox.
Go, but without me.
I was a fool to trust Tomi.
What kind of beer does he have?
That was a secret.
I trust him.
Lucky to see a dead star.
Japan has diplomatic relations with China.
My parents don't live anymore.

I love you.
This isn't your hat, is it?
Tom doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
You can go home now.
It's just an empty threat.
Two old guerrillas stand in front of our house.
They were shitting me.
The snowflakes fell on her long, blonde hair.

He keeps his word.
I don't count on any special treatment.
Her old friends turned her away.
Tom didn't put enough sugar in my coffee.
I'm sure I'm not going through tomorrow's exam.
The sentence's all right.

Horse!
I've never seen anything like this in my life.
I'm gonna call Tom right now.
I broke up with my girlfriend.
Hopefully things will be fine.

I'm from Trondheim.
Tom doesn't know.
I need more places.
Tom taught me the most of what I know in French.
Shall we have a drink?
He's keeping his money in the bank.
I don't care if you believe me.
What do you think these are?
It's hard for everyone to be in the mood.
There's a solution.
How much do you think Tom is looking for?
There's no such thing!
This world is controlled by evil forces.
He laughed to expose his fear.
I'm in line right now.
Can I get a pound of boned tuna, please?
Don't make noise.
The story was real.
The wounded scream from the pain after the anesthetic effect has passed.
That's what I need.
How much money do you have?
Focus.
They're not talking at all.
Cease fire!
He always asks for your opinions.
We use margarine instead of butter.
I'm very pleased with this sale.

I'm sleeping.
He doesn't understand you.
I'll explain.

We're all safe.
It was smooth.
Calm down.
They drank two bottles of wine.
Come tomorrow.
Can we try this?
The table is green.

Please say it out loud.
You have to keep your eyes open.
Tomi has a black cat.
There are heroes of courage, and trust in friendship.

I like melons.
I'd rather not go out today.
The woman sitting there is her current wife.

What did you do last night?
Let's eat a donut.
Tom's intentions weren't clean.
Do you have my book?
Please think about it.
Tom did what he wanted.
I see the light.
I'm just as guilty as anyone else.
You're worse than me.
Don't mess with me around here.
There's nothing urgent.
Tom won't hurt me.
Greens.
You can't always win.
It's a silver coin.
I feel powerless.
Goodbye.
I'm flattered.
It's 10:00 p.m.
The road is full of gloves.
What do the papers say?
You were lucky.
Can I go home?
If it's time, let's go for a picnic.
I love you, but I'm not in love with you.
- Whose are these rings?
I'm convinced that this tennis mutilation will be my win.
They went to Boston.
One of us is wrong.
I'm surprised what I found out.
Elephants have two ears.

My hobby is reading novels.
You'll get used to it quickly.
I don't know why Tomi went to the hospital.

I don't mind waiting.
We helped each other.
That's what happened when he was outside.
Tom painted the door green.
Just start working.
I'm sure I'm hallucinating.
Tom cleaned Mary's car.
Let's take a look.
You're the most important thing in my life.
But the proposed changes contradicted each other.
I planted this tree.
Tom let me go.
May I have your full name?
It's boring.
I don't care what he says.
I told you this wouldn't work.
Tom gave Mary a chocolate.
Don't complain, don't explain.
Here's your boarding card.
I saw one.
What's your business?
Tom Mary's boss.
Little or no chance of finding the real conspirators.
They've failed Tom.
Too bad I'm late.
Tomi disagreed with Mari.
I want to put a smile on your lips.
Is that a bird?
I satisfied Tom and Mary.
Is that a wolf?
There's a military base nearby.
You have to do this.
I have a bad day.
All right, people, let's go!
Tom went on a trip with his friends.

Tom tried to reduce his expenses.
Tomi called the dog to sit down.
Tomi's never coming back, is she?
You know me.
It doesn't fit to speak with a full mouth.
Tomi might need it.
For me, he's like a king.
She looks young.
I'm from Japan.
I saw Dana.
Tom's good for animals.
I didn't register.
The salt you put in the soup is white, not pink.
I always take care of you.
Tom started cleaning up.
I go on a train every day.
You look nervous.
We have to stop now.
Do you really believe in magic?
I don't know exactly where I was born.
I'm scared of Tomi.
I'm glad we agree on something.
Then the bear ran to the stable, threw off her bear skin and touched it with the wand that the witch gave her. In a moment, the skin turned into a beautiful ballermaid, made out of moonlight, and the taliska turned into a fad, which two dancers pulled.
Don't make a mistake.
Don't you get it right now?
You're sacrificing your time to books.
He's tall?
I'm gonna wait for Tomira.
I heard you're not going home.
I'm dying of your complaints.

The next train arrives on track 2 and goes to Shibuya at 4:35.
Did you?
What are they doing there?
Would you like a cup of tea?
Any more of this?
I can't find my other gloves.
Tom's a coup.
Nurses take care of the patient at night and day.
People don't think it's strange today when a man grows his hair for a long time.
A boy got my wallet when he was on his bike next to me.
Who do you trust?
Here's my e-mail address.
Can you help me take a cab?
Tomi had an alibi.
I know if he's an enemy or not.
Can I do something for you?
You know the whole town.
Someone put me in.
Mary's not that pretty.
That bookkeeper had some ink on it.
He wanted to go out.
Tom lacks flexibility.
Next year, I'm going to Australia.
Are you Japanese?
He was a poor musician.
Animals are our friends.
I don't like surprises like this.
He was an innocent man.
It's an opportunity.
This is Tom's house.
I know you can help us.
I saw him with my own eyes and I heard him with my own ears.
Would you excuse us for just one second, please?
What's your beer?
I won't let them use my Husqvarna chain saw.
In the bathroom all the way to the ceiling, everything was smuggled out.
I'm going to read the description to turn it on.
The neighborhood was full of silence.
They were crying.
Tom has no idea about reality.
Hey, listen to me.
You live with your parents?
I'm not that naive.
I opened the door with him.
I know you don't like funerals.
Do you have enough time?
Spanish used to be the official language of the Philippines.
Emily's home.
My son is looking for more than me.

You went out to eat, didn't you?
I need a coke.
He's a beard.

Look at that.
Thank you for your trust in me.

Lots of boys running in the park.
I could have done better.
We all agreed.
I've never eaten shells before.
My car keeps stopping.
I don't have to tell you Tom's late.
I can't find it.
We need to fix it.
Are you sick of the daily robot?
He has half as many books as I do.
We're extremely busy.
Boris asked me to give you this.
We're all crazy.
Tom can understand why Mari feels depressed.
There's someone at the door.

I guess you've already packed up and ready to go.
It's hard to believe this whole time was clean and sunny.

Kick!
When did you work in Boston?
No one knew who did this.
What are you talking about?
How old are you?
We're going to the classroom.
Tom's busy.
There are people that can easily be influenced.
I don't understand why I shouldn't do that.
It's not a bad idea.
Which way are you going?

Stop fixing me!
I'm stunned.
Is this going to affect me?
I always drink two cups of coffee in the morning.
I grabbed Tomi at the elbows.
I don't know where Tom's umbrella is.
That's the last straw.
I ran all the way to the station this morning.
That was great.
Maybe I'll eat it later when I'm hungry.
Is there anything between you two?

My dream is to be a teacher.
That's very kind of you.

I want to learn in French next year.
I'm terrible with kids.
Tom's 13 years old, but he still believes in Santa.
Why don't you sleep?
I hope I see him again.

It worked wonderfully.
There are more houses behind the houses.

Be there right then.
He knows everything about cooking.

How nice.
I need to talk to him.
He's cold.

I did it the way I didn't understand it.
Good sense of humor helps in difficult situations.
Got it?
I'll see you around.
That'll be interesting.
Are you gone?
I have black hair.
The day last night was hot, but it was lighter today.
We need to warn Tom.

Have you ever had Petanque?
There's also a fashionable sock.
I couldn't figure it out.
I can't follow your logic.
What do you want to do in the future?
Tom's safe.
We understand purpose.
No one was there.
All my questions have been answered.
I knew you'd get in trouble.
Tomi has a guest.
I feel sharp chest pain.
I'm willing to risk it.
How can you say that?

Have you guys behaved well today?
You're a fool!

If it wasn't for the map, I would have lost it.
I think he's coming.
It's tomorrow's Tuesday.

Can you tell me exactly what you really want?
My wife left me.
We don't want anything from you.
You know where the problem is.
What are you looking at?
It's unlikely Tom knows where Mari lives.
I need three ice creams.
She's in Tom's pyjamas.
I was waiting for you.
Tom.
No one lives in this house.
As far as English is concerned, no one can make peace.
Sponge on it!

What are they going to do?
Tom led the attack.
Tom's almost never eating beans.
No, it's not my house.
I live in New York City.
We ran out of coffee.
Let's beer!
What would you do if it was your child?
My kids don't lie to me.
I'm not proud of my daughter.
It never ends.
They both laugh.
I wish you didn't do that right now.
I was trying to help Tomi.
Your soul is inferred to hell.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
I'm starting to get in.
Take this off.
He won his love.
She left a class.
Can you give me that cup?
In my opinion, Twitter is just a waste of time.
Come on, touch him.

The moon belongs to no one.
We were born for these reasons.
I helped Tomi make his Christmas tree cry out.

I have doubts as to whether this will work.
Let's go wash up.
He's not there for sports, just like I am.
I have a phone.
Tom went back to the hotel.
You got a TV?
What do you want me to do with Tomi?
I feel better every day.
I feel light.
What do doctors say?
I forgot her last name.

He likes trains.
We're home today.
I saw Tomi dancing with another girl.
No one was in the room.
Tom threw his girlfriend's photos in the fire.

This is our secret.
Why are you restless?
I'm sorry, but I didn't fully understand what you said.
Last night, fire was near us.
We better go, Tom.
It's likely you all could use some sleep.
I'm pretty sure Tom's not gonna eat that.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
I got on the plane.
Are you home?
Clouds surround the mountain.
That's my problem.
How can I explain that to you?
He's in the kitchen.
I should have done that with you.
Maybe I don't want to eat the same thing again today.
I assume Thomas was right.

Why doesn't Tom want to come with us?
What a mess!
How annoying!

How about we get out of here tonight for dinner?
Dreams have come true.

It was like a father to me.
You'll regret it.
Help's on the way.
Do you speak French in Canada?
I wish I could do it.
Keep watching.
I hope you don't mind if I leave early.
Come as you are.

This is so wrong.
Tomi touched my hand.
Who brought this?
The floor's full of glass cylinders.
These bananas are not mature.

Tom's a scientist.
Is it really close to Sicilian Malta?
Tom's too old for me.
Being black is not a sin.
I grew up, but my fear didn't go away from the darkness.
Ice's melted.
There was Thomas and Mary.
It's fair if you get the same pay for the same job.
After the incident, our relationship went through a sudden change.
I've been crying over the night.
Tom says he never liked Chinese food.
Thomas works in a pastry.
Jim was caught cheating on me at the exam.
What's wrong with your dog?
Tom was home all weekend.
I think I should have helped Tom.
We're not gonna let Tomi do that.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
Looks like I don't have to be here.
I'd love to eat something.
Thank you for not saying "I told you so."
Everything's back to normal.
How did you think of such a good excuse?
You cheated!
I have to leave early.
The decision hasn't been made yet.
I sold it this afternoon.

He was wounded during a burglary theft.
Are we all ready?
He took a lot of money.

Say it straight.
I'll tell you.
Tom's useless.
I just want to do something fun.
There's another man in his life.
You speak good Chinese?
I'll be there tonight.
When we got back, there were only eight team members left.
What's a UFO?
I lived there for five years.
I'll give this to Tom.
You're the only one who needs me.
Why should we be interested in this?
Is there any doubt?
I loved swimming, swimming was my favorite sport in high school.
The English appreciate freedom.
He's really good at talking.
I know Tom's happy.
Let us not forget the main purpose of this meeting.
Don't pull your forehead.
Canada's first hymn was written in French.
Leave the dog out!
I play volleyball often.
Who's that man?
The robots will definitely put you in the world.
We need to find a way to stop Tom.
No one's taking me anywhere.
The sign says "free smoking".
I saw Thomas today.
What a strange country!
Your friends are waiting for you.
Of course.
When it came out of the shower, it was just a towel.
These pictures raise bad memories.
Are you happy?
What the hell is wrong with you people?
I'll text you later.

I knew it was us.
Oranges are bigger than Mandarins.

Tom was wearing a black coat.
Come whenever you want.
I'm a little tired.
I'll be ready in a few minutes.
Sit where I can see you.
Please interpret my strange dreams.
I'm gonna be late.
I did it without you.
I'm sorry, but I think you're wrong.
I really like city life.
Tom cares about his own business.
It doesn't fit to look down on others.
It's the same for everyone.
I'm not ugly.
Some people have mocked my situation.
You forgot our wedding anniversary.
I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't kill myself.
Fix the watch.
We're looking for oil.
One more time.
Be careful, it could be a trap.
I can't take it that long away from my wife.
There is still no clear definition of what the country means.
It's a big world.
"What happened?" "The car broke down."
Don't spend money you haven't even got.
It's a little early for drinking, isn't it?
They're all yelling.
How much does beer cost?
He was accused of failure.
He raised his hand.
He always laughs and has fun.
You, me and him there, Joseph, we make a team.
He told me he'd be leaving soon.
My mom lived with us.
People don't like what they don't understand.
You're a very special person for me.

I'm Ricardo.
Where should we go?
The paper says he committed suicide.
Hurry up or we'll be late.
Are you selling a personal computer in this store?
Have you had lunch?
Where's love?
Don't worry, I'll look at it for you.
There was still a little bit of hope that maybe everything would be in place.
I'm surprised no one voted for the candidate.
I have twins.
What the hell?
Tom probably won't be here tomorrow.
Tom needs to go to school.
My neck hurts a little.
I won't let Tom go to Boston.
They've surrounded the Earth.
The goods arrive at sea.
No one can stop him.
I know who he is.
I should have denied doing that.
Tom's gonna be really mad.
Why are you doing this?
Shut up and do what they say to you.
What a wonderful performance!
I can't drive a car.
Tomi wanted everyone to have a happy Christmas.
Down with corrupt politicians!
Tomi left the company in 2013.
Tom and Mary were both home.
You're afraid of this dog.
I want to buy a dozen donuts.
She sent me a dress.
He's jealous.
Tom doesn't have much time to relax.
Tom wants to try.
Tell me where you were last night at the time of the murder.
Stop it while you can.
Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fifteen, fifteen, sixteen, eighteen, eighteen, eighteen, eighteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty.
We're half an hour after midnight.
You have an hour.
I've risen above my fears.
Why did you buy this bull?
Stay still, please.
It's a black horse.
Do you have enough money?
Let's start the weekend.
The teacher kept him after school.
I like that shirt.

I'll never thank you without your help.
Tom agreed to go to Boston.
She sent you a book.
I have an old bike.
I have to run.
Have a nice vacation.
She didn't want to play golf for Tomi.
It's a little chance for me to get to the meeting.
They weren't there.
Tom did good.
I'm kind of tired.
I don't remember ever getting tired of working, even though nothing is going to get me out of it.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
We compared Tom and Mary's work.
This is the new model.
No one left except Tom.
I'm not dead.
Do you know who said that?
We're exhausted.
She wants you dead.
I demand a refund.
John always knew a way out of the seemingly hopeless situations.
Heart disease.
Is everybody okay?
I think he's my best friend.

I don't want to go with you.
Which is your cup?
The base was very tight.
Do you know how to play majong?
I'm trying to get some help.

Tom's too late.
You're not holding hands, are you?
Do you want me again?
We can't wait two weeks.
We'll come and visit you.
I named my daughter Nairu and wanted a long life for him.
How did you know Tom was going to Boston?
Tom never asked why.
Don't talk to him while he's driving.
In addition to this weather, we better stay home and not go anywhere.
He's got 50 kilos.
Tomi tried to expose her frustration.
I can't believe Tomi was able to do all this alone.

You can't enter this area.
Tom should never have come back.
You don't have to scream.
Yes, the lady is our manager.
I'm not really hungry for a moment.
That's better.
You missed school because of sickness.
Those roses aren't as beautiful as these.
She decided to take a red car.
Use your own money.
No one knows their names.
We trust you don't.
You're exhausted.
Who was watching you?
I just borrowed it.
I'm sure Tom will be found guilty.
Where are you from, Karen?
Are you saying it's my fault?
Tom should have done that by now.
It's just a rumor.

Just between us, that ugly cow is dieting.
Shit!
I want you to run to the store for me.
He drank a whole bottle of milk.
I wish you a good trip.

It's a nice color.
Sit down, Tomi.
We're gonna eat here.
He's making that up.

I made a decision.
He was the last person I expected to see during my American stay.
That's what we agreed on.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
That's not a good idea.
They're both in the room.
I'm going to take a shower.
It was a long day.

Your boy looks like a monkey.
I was worried you might leave me.
Wasn't enough?

The stolen money will never be boyished.
We've been working with the company.
Whatever happens, the letter will be delivered.
Wow, my friend, this shit is awesome!
Are you planning on using this again?
