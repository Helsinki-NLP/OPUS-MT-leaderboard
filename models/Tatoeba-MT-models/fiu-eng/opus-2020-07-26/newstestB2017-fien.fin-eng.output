The 28-year-old cook was found dead at the Sanfranciscola mall
A 28-year-old cook who was only recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairs of the local shopping center this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally done his job."
The body found at the Westfield shopping centre on Wednesday morning was identified as a Sanfranciscola, Frank Galicia, reports San Francisco Medical Agency.
San Francisco Police Department says they're investigating death as a homicide.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who worked earlier in Boston, had found his dream job when he was getting to San Francisco Sons & Daughers' kitchen master six months ago.
The representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock for all of them.
"We're a small and close team like a family, and we're very sorry," says the representative.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia says Frank first lived in Hostelles, but he had finally done his job.
"He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend," told Louis Galicia's KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being with the family was to put food on all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get involved with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the power.
Despite all the flaws in the world, he was an unscrupulous diamond that created every day," he says.
All people who know about this case are asked to call San Francisco Police Department's tip number 415-575-444.
Lacsiating junior doctors are calling for new measures to combat work.
British junior doctors, who are primarily responsible for specialised doctors in Finland, have called on their trade union representatives to request permission for new labour-related measures in dispute on a new contract.
The JDC Committee on Juniors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is asking for support from its entire government for further work-related measures from early September onwards.
According to JDC, ministers have not solved the problem of the agreement.
Juniors and medical students voted against the agreement with BMA in July.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday night, President Ellen McCourt published a letter sent to JDC members by the Junior Medical Committee, where he said that the government 'been self-sufficiently' issues which McCourt said led to the fight against the agreement.
The letter states: "In this light, the JDC Government has completely rejected the new draft agreement and calls for new formal negotiations on all our concerns.
In response to the government's difficulties, the JDC Government has today submitted an official request to the BMA Government asking for permission to be given to work-related, least-exploited, anti-employing measures from the beginning of September."
As a result of the dispute, the junior doctors have already been in strike six times this year, the first of which were the complete positions ever seen in the history of the public health care system in Britain.
Mr Malawana, the Director of BMA's Junior Doctors, resigned after the vote, for he did not accept the negotiated terms of agreement recommended by BMA.
At previous meetings, Malawana said to the members of the BMA that the agreement was good and should be accepted. 54 000 junior doctors and medical students took part in the vote.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would enter into force and apply to British doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met with their hands for reconciliation and formal decision of the war and economic sanctions of eight months.
However, when Vladimir Putin took up his Turkish brother in the golden hall of St. Peter’s palace, I had a clear impression that the greater desire for reconciliation was in Ankara.
The parties did,
But Putin's smile looked thin, and he didn't have much heat on his own tightest standard.
On the other hand, the Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke repeatedly about his "good friend" Mr Putin — five times according to one report.
I didn't keep my bills on my own.
He also promised that relations with Russia would come back even better than before the crisis.
The next day a newspaper in our country wrote Erdogan was acting like no evil ever happened.
I myself understood his zeal for the contrary.
But the continued violet of Putin’s sight showed that the head of Russia has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down the border of Syria by the Russian combat plane.
Moscow's reaction to the event period was fierce.
Putin attacked Ankara strictly and accused him of being stabbed in the back.
The insult was even bigger because it came from a supposed friend.
Getting real trust back will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, government-controlled media were involved in a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, the Turkish people seemed to be the reason for everything.
The most serious was the accusations of top officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas controlled by Isisi in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the accusations.
However, the official message from Peter was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only held so that Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could gain some form of victory.
The benefits of a serious ceasefire are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost excluded from power in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him, too.
There is also an economic impact on harmony.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the chartering ban, as many millions Russian tourists travel annually to the Turkish coast.
The amount has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly take care of relief when air traffic can eventually continue.
They put their faith in the late season of the Mediterranean.
And yet again this week, the state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall once again when Turkey's agricultural products are allowed to import.
"The tourists there, the tomatoes back here", was formulated in Vedomost's article.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it thinks the West reacts to the coup attempt to take power.
Without forgetting the old grudge from the Turkish EU accession negotiations and the absence of Putin, which is eager to take advantage of the cool gap and to make Turkey’s links to the west.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the coup.
This was self-evident to Moscow, who was concerned about the exchange of power.
Thus, at their peak, Russia and Turkey could convey a picture of what was described by an analyst as a "outside alliance": two countries that felt that they had been rejected by the West and that they had been treated as objects.
Despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between these two.
The most important thing is Syria, where Moscow has created itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It is a great deal to say that, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both the presidents told us at the press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The Turkish President was very concerned about refusing to answer the question of national differences, while Putin stressed them.
There is no clear agreement between the countries on where they can reach agreement in Syria.
Having regard to the possibility of a complete disaster caused by the Turkish Member State of NATO to shoot down the Russian fighting machine, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two Heads of State are even again in speech.
The Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland
According to the Director General of the RBS Bank, the Bank's activities outside Scotland will be reduced so that it will continue to provide only business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was initially related to the bank's global objectives.
The bank had to back off its goals when it collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that period, brands’ railists have used RBS to protect other consumer financing brands.
It sponsors millions of pounds of international sports, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let down more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to customers in Scotland, but it will not be used as a discount on RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWeste, with the exception of headquarters and stock exchange lists.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwani was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS will become an investment brand, and because of the fact that our staff is in service, because we are now becoming a lot more bank for different brands.
Since the bank itself became a worldwide brand, RBS also became a worldwide brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, they are local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different within its own community, and our staff work with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of various brands in sports sponsorship.
"Now is the time to become a bank containing different brands, as it is essentially a question of how we can make the bank better for customers," says the President of the Bank.
"It would have been very difficult three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and put brands into use.
But the work we have done and concentration on the needs of our customers instead of our own needs has changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think time is right."
Frankie Dettor rode Predilection to victory in Newmarket and won his 3,000th victory
Detori sprays champagne twice in a row at Newmarket, which meant a $3,000 win for him.
Jocky Frankie Dettor confirmed his $3,000 victory in the UK Championship in Newmarket Friday.
On the same night as the night he won the Predilection twice on the track of his own locality. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettor, 45, is the sixth jockey to achieve this milestone in a flat-line race.
Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
A three-time champion ofjockey Dettor, who previously won the Ghayar, says: "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here too.
I'm very glad this happened in Newmarket because I just ended up here 30 years ago.
The event is not a great event, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a 20 000-person audience.
I'm relieved and I feel great humility."
Detori takes the cheers with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have arrived at the virtuous contests, and they are champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won his record career more than 4 300 times.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4 493 winners
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is not a surprise that he has just reached this milestone, which only rarely has been reached.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical progress is what separates him from others.
He is a fantastic representative of the race race, of his enthusiasm and of his furry has brought supporters of the species for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have won 6 000 races if he wasn't only competing on weekends and only on big races!
Speaking of serious, Frankie's horseback in the British race has been winning for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a lively person, which is good for the British race, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettor fanned his achievement in a symbolic way by flying down his horse.
"From flying paint to flying landings Frankie Dettor has been a model for British racing for two decades.
There's a lot of top- and lower-downs on the way.
He has won numerous big races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived flight accident and has been in a competitive ban due to drug abuse.
When the non-competition ended three years ago, he had difficulty in starting, but he showed an admirable nature of strength, showed his doubts and returned to his best.
And he has not yet finished his career – Dettor has recently said he wants to continue the competition until he is at least 50."
Putin was separated by Chief of Administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed his managing director Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to Kremlin’s announcement, President Putin “the decision to release Ivanov as Head of the Russian President’s Administration,” but no grounds for dismissal were stated.
Anton Vano, acting as Deputy Head of Ivanov since 2012.
Gogao, 44, he's a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn in 1972 from the National Institute for International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and has worked previously at the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later, he led the President’s protocol department and the government’s office, reports the Russian-speaking website of Kreml.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: "I am grateful for your trust.
I believe that the main task of the administration is to support your role as Head of State, which means to make draft laws and to monitor how your instructions are implemented."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for a distinction and recommended him to be his successor.
Are there any real smiles?
This transfer has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been in the vicinity of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, has a KGB dimension.
As Head of Administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on the Russian state television, both said Ivanov would withdraw from his own request.
Despite the smiles shown on the cameras, the explanations only convince the few, especially under the parliamentary elections.
Are the fires caused by some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very distrustful of the formal claim that a man who has been appointed as President suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy.
The Kreml website provides Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me this very complex and, to some extent, difficult task for four years.
Now I have served as President General for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB's National Security Service.
When Putin was appointed Head of the Security Service for the Remuneration of the KGB (FSB) in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed his Deputy Chief of Staff.
When Putin entered power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
In time, it was thought that Ivanov might become President of Russia after the second period of Putin, as the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for the third period.
However, the mission went to another area near Putin, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to President only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds – Star of the FBI Researchers series Thomas Gibson was fired after the producer hit
Gibson was involved in a violent fight at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which are producing Series, told us about the kicks in their joint communications.
As Special Agent Aaron Hotchner in the series, Gibson had filed an apology on Thursday before his resignation was reported.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened," he says in his announcement.
Information on how Gibson's character is written out of the FBI's next series of agents, published later, will be reported in the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously, in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, 54-year-old Gibson has been involved in the series since its first production period, i.e. since 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I have put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," says Gibson in his release on Friday.
"I was hoping to see you all the way to the end of the show, but that's not possible anymore.
I would like to thank all the scriptwriters, producers, actors, our great production team and most important: the best fans that the show could ever have hoped for."
The production period of Series 12 will begin in the United States on September 28th.
The mysterious coastline of fish into the Banffilla garden
Kevin Bain, living in Banff, has asked for help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain doubts that these 75 fish are windmills that have been caught up in the earth as a cloud of a circling storm.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea coast, published pictures of the vision in Periscope and hoped to receive the answer to the appearance of these five-like fish.
The Queensferry crossing has now been attached to Fifeen
The project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have attached Queensferry's crossing bridge to the northern deck and to the ground bridge, which means that the bridge has now been attached to Fifeen.
It is the first of the four parts between the "twilights", which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fifeta is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 vinocer ropes.
The project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Keith Brown, Minister for Economic Affairs, visited the site today and was one of the first ones to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry's crossing bridge.
We are all witnessing very significant progress in building a bridge. More than 30 000 concrete and steel have been used to build this bridge section.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge between the bridge and the bridge, the construction is a subtle operation which requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
There are now almost 79% of the whole bridge, and the rest of the deck is about to be in the presence of its concrete syth in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be raised."
Michael Martin, Head of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructions, says: "The first bridge section is always a significant drop in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the peak in road and water construction.
When the last part of the road was installed and attached to the North Tower road cover, then we had to close the remaining northern (i.e. underground) cell.
This was done by pulling 700 millimetres south of the North Pole.
This was a massive operation requiring great accuracy at the same time.
It is massive because it has a length of 222 metres and a weight of about 6 000 tonnes and had to be drawn up at a angle of approximately 3%.
And demanding great precision, because the tolerances that the working team had to follow were very small — just a few millimeters.
It all went well, luckily."
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Department tells us about three men's wondrous revolution
Anglesey was represented by three men who were in the water for his fishing boat, saved like a miracle store.
Moelfre RNLI’s marine rescue station alarmed on Friday at 13.20 p.m. local time for its crew’s observed accident in the Bay of Moelfre Bay.
Three men were desperate to swim in security while their boat continued to go unsupervised without a pilot.
"We saw a boat running right next to them, and we imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, driving the Moelfre lifeboat.
By the time we got in the water, the strong winds, fortunately, had carried the boat away from them.
The local fishing boat saved two men, while the third one, at the age of 60, was found exhausted by the birch and no lifeboats.
All of them were taken to the coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle that these three men in water are still alive and perfectly well.
There was an emergency noise in the boat's engine, but for some reason, it had been degenerate by a boat from a man of time in connection with the fall.
They really had luck on their journey."
Pokémon Go hunts for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the last decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but rather stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get up on the couch and move.
Originally, it was only television watching, then video games and the latest smartphones came.
So it is wonderful to note that technology and the foreign movement do not close up.
This, of course, refers to Pokkémon Go. Pokkéon Go is a game application whose characters come from a video game created in the 1990s (of which a series of drawings, card cards and other accessories were later made).
Like many of the popular cultural phenomena, this also stole a little before the new game was made available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
Lanseeration in other countries delayed due to the immense interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users in Pokkémon Go game passed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
Then how does the game work?
In short, the players will go out looking for pochemones on their smartphone, which are monitored using GPS. When you find a punch, it can be "lighting" (by using a phone display) or "table".
The villing has been stamped with a video game as a younger generation and has raised the back from the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps taken by the average person per day.
Washington Post recently told us about the Cardiogram app in Apple Watch, which found within two days of the launch of the game, that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram follows 35,000 users.
The company does not know who users play Pokémon Go game, it only sees raw data on physical activity.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to rise on the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have gone to deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have seemed unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be reduced.
Regularly moving probability of developing cancer or depression is lower.
The exercise helps in weight management, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The fineness of the Pokémon Go game is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
This makes it possible to achieve three basic health - supporting things — exercise, fresh air, sun, and joy.
During the hunt, it's possible to have even new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes atrocious gladiator.
And yes, someone can walk to the door when they play.
What about it?
There's been a breakthrough.
For even though smart phone applications such as Fitzbit may have been able to monitor your activity before, they did not allow you to leave, as Go does.
There will be a loss of freshness, and the use will be reduced in time.
However, the success of Pokémons will result in more games where applications and virtual reality are combined with active activity in the real world, which will increase the mobility and improvement of people leaving the yachts and their condition and health.

Simone Biles caught gold in a women's tennis team multi-play
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynaamism jump.
I don't care. I don't care.
You're gonna have to have a peacock with a permano.
That's great.
And now, at last, the Olympic winner.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnast won the championship of the multi-play and grew the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than the "Final Five" teammate in Aly Raisman and Russian Prossimist Aliya Mustafin.
The US Simone Biles performs on the boom of women's gymnastics in the finals of the multi-stakeholder competition in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday 2016 at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
The party became the fourth consecutive American woman of all time who won the championship, thus strengthening his reputation as the best of his generation or even of all time.
Biles broke into tears when his finalal total points came to be seen and his long way to this moment ended.
The prey takes the species to completely new dimensions and brings him into the same category with other superstars such as Michael Phelps:
He has won 15 World Championships, of which 10 gold, and earned them with so ambitious and precise programmes, that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest gymnast of all time".
There was yet another final competition in Brazil, which was mainly between Biles and his own and the burden of excessive expectations, not between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring by less than a courly gold medal would be a disappointment.
The US Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman hug gold and silver women's tennis team in the finals of the individual competition in the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11.8.2016
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on i on the ground team coordinated and now retired to Martha Karoly's children.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought about anything since he was at the top for a long time, it was not entirely true.
Some of his permato program, which includes his instrumented volts, has been adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside the Olympics in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
By the time his grandparents were adopted, Coach Aimee Boorman's mother was found to be a powerful character, and Boorman found a girl when he was on a day trip to the gym where Boorman was trained.
He has not lost any multi-stakeholder competition since summer 2013, and the winning pipe is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a little lead on two tours, it was like weeding.
There was a boom and a perm, where Biles is the defender of the world.
After getting back to the lead position, he was able to get 15.433 points from the boom, and he was crowned with 15.933 points from his final score.
Raisman swept him mildly in waiting for the final points — a mere formality — and tears began to appear around the red, white and blue bound color of Biles, when his dream, once written in his playbook, was fulfilled.
Raisman's performance was a small revan for four years ago's competition, when he first divided the third place but then lost the pross to Mustafia in the rerun.
This time, 22-year-old team leader called the team "mumum" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent airlocks to the public after his permut program and thus emerged from the position of defeat as a winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old, earlier week-on-week wide-ranging twitch now has a whole new meaning:
Police report three musices in the car listening to me as a victim of a serial killer.
Two women and one 12-year-old girl got killed in Phoenix's most devastating mass murder in ten years. The victims sat in the car and listened to music when they were shot, says the police press release published on Thursday.
According to the authorities on 12 June, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and her daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the streetside.
The shooter was standing on the passenger side of the car, where he shot eight shots on the gun and then fled by another car, the press says.
The police suspect that the triple death was not the result of a robbery because the attacker didn't take his handbags or the $2,900 found in the hearing of the second adult victim.
The Phoenix police reporter, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says the police are now investigating whether death is related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two wounded in nine attacks, mostly in Latin American territories within four months.
"It is common to the people involved that they have happened in residential areas outside their homes," Howard told CBS's subsidiary KPHHO of the television and radio company earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the brown Nissan, the late 1990s, the black BMW and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers do not want to reveal what made them decide that attacks are linked and that their author is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital because of his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The witness told the police that the triangle had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a report that reported only half an hour before the triple death of the open van, which is thought to be the same in either case.
The researchers found shells and took a bullet from the car's seat and a bullet from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephalitis: "The things are getting better."
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other partners, Edmund has a microcephalic, or birth - minor, because of her mother's genetic disorder, Elizabeth Picciuto, from which she was not aware when she was pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I wouldn't make it.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not true at all – of course you're committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never recognize them and perhaps not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there was any more of that practice," says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with a roll-in device.
Edmund got up and sat down until he was 3 years old, and he still doesn't speak.
But he's slow on his own pace.
He's walking helpless. He's riding a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth presents the sign that Edmund invented, which means "saul for me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told the CBS News news.
However, it does not just mean normal sign language, but also includes fives invented by Edmund himself.
Microkephalia may have a variety of diseases: hereditary, such as Edmund, or pregnancy-related viral infections such as ashtray or zicavirus.
There are great variations in the customs and forecasts.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of those who have been infected with zizavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional storm caused by a uncertain future.
"I kept saying, "What happens to us?
"What happens to us."
He still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a forecast in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it to you."
But Picciuto has hope to give advice to mothers whose children have birth defects caused by the ziza virus.
"It's getting better.
It's just that things are gonna work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Heavy rains and floods caused massive rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the Governor of Louisiana declared an emergency due to heavy pollution and widespread floods, and more rainfalls in the state are expected on Saturday.
According to the national weather service, several rivers in south-east Lisbon and South Massip are flooding over their lawns and spreading to a wide area as a result of powerful heavy rainfalls.
Governor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana tells us that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, the informant of the National Agency for Security and Emergency Security, reports the Agency's requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandheads.
According to Steele, only the district of Tangipahoa has requested tens of thousands of sand.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most parts of South Louisiana.
According to the weather service’s information, water may still enter the area 76 to 122 mm more.
In southern Albania, flood warning was given on Friday when the rains continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend, near the Comite River and the Amite River, near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to record heights.
According to weatherman Alek Krautmann, many houses on riverside may have to flood under the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that the floods in the Ascension district constitute a threat, since flooding rivers are slowly emptying into Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Maurepas.
In Louisiana Liverpool, the Tickfaw river, running south of the Mississippi State border, was on Friday at 9 a.m. already higher than ever.
The rescue work continued in the districts of Amiten and Wilkinson, South-Western Massissip.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and boyfriend were earlier on Friday near Gloster's saved ones.
Hansford, 62, tells us that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 metres away from his house, rose quickly during the night.
He had been warned by another boy living nearby.
"We got up, and the water came out with a constant feed," says Hansford.
"It extended to my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high during the 48 years she had lived in the area.
Hansford tells us that he and his family have all injuries, and he is the only drug addict.
The rescue workers had saved all three large military trucks and taken them to the fire station at Gloster, where they held protection on Friday.
Governor Krautmann says that floods are spreading rapidly when heavy pollution continues, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells us about the data from the observator of Livingston that nearly 350 mm had rained between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says that the soil is soaked after the rains started on Wednesday.
The authorities say that due to the rainfall and the flooding of streets, the people of Tangipahoa county were forced to be saved from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the City Council of Tangipa had informed CBS’ subsidiary WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated into two churches, but now the flood has reached both of them.
The county leader Robby Miller tells us that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pet animals that had remained prisoners of the flood.
There's been shelters for Evacuated people in the cities of Amie and Hammond.
"They'll be able to return to their homes when the water starts to retreat," he says.
In the city of Hammond, nearly twenty streets were forced to be closed because of the flood, and sandflakes were offered for residents to try to stop water from entering their homes and businesses.
"The last time we had a big flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, a member of the city government.
"This flood seems similar."
In Mississip, the rains continued to be even on the Gulf coast, says Rupert Lacy, County Rescue Director of Harrison County.
Lacy tells us that on Thursday, there was no report of the house under the mortar flood, but so far there was no information.
The head of the Shopper Value Foods Store, Keith Townson, tells us that he's been living in the Amie region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and more rain all the time."
Six-year-old Mahád Brown, who's got multiple bullets in his body, survives from the Philadelphia shooting scene.
According to the police, a 6-year-old son has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already another 6-year-old who has been shot in town this week.
The kid's grandparents told me on CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to grandparents, the boy had multiple gunshot wounds in the necks, legs, arms, and stomachs, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot of hits, his little body was full of bullets," said the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is true."
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital, and he has been subjected to multiple surgery.
The family tells the TV company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was about to start his first grade in local secondary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old men were also shot.
Another 29-year-old state was reported to be critical and two other conditions were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found on the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded could have been a shooter.
The police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a cross between many armed men.
The scene was filled with assault weapons types of seals, which are derived from various assault weapons.
"It is absolutely clear that this was the ongoing fight.
There were shells on the street on both sides of the footwalk.
There have been several armed fighters and they have been actively involved in the shooting", Chief Inspector Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and I hear the police are going through surveillance videos.
Another victim of the shooting in town this week was a girl whose hand was misguided when she played on Tuesday at her home in the West Oak Lane district.
She's getting better, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
In this name, I call women's tennis team the Olympic team, and there are more than one reason.
Firstly, I have been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team's composition, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everything proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best female teamman has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were on the bridges 1 and 2.
This is awesome.
At the previous Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas rose to be the surprise winner of the competitions, and the whole America was cheering.
Now the world has proved the incredible performances and surprising and masterful tests of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez.
Simone became the fourth consecutive American on Thursday, who won gold in a woman's individual contest.
The teammate Aly Raisman won silver.
Such views are at the top of the species, but the same does not seem to be the case in the telecommunications lessons throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are five last ("Final Five"), because there will be only four gymnasts for the next Olympic team, and this will be Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
The reality, however, is that telecommunications is an expensive sport and the gymnasts practice mainly in private gymnasts, which are maintained by their parents. Parents are responsible for training costs, facilities, trips, accommodation, competition fees, hotel fees (trainers, gymnastors and family members) etc.
Most telecommunications euro premises are located in prosperous residential areas that are capable of supporting operations.
The teacher teaching takes place in these clubs, which means expensive and long-term commitment to the family of the gymnasts.
Coach Aimee Boorman and Coach Laurie Hernandez, Simone Biles, have both trained species practitioners since they started the gym.
We need to organise a more favourable and more accessible work force training for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been raised by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I set up my own Telecommunications Foundation 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harle have offered free or affordable opportunities for the field of public service training for more than 15 000 urban young people (mainly black and Latin Americans) and these young people have been caught up in national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities to my hometown Detroit, so that we can offer high-quality weight testing for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympics.
Telecommunications develops strength, nobility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings the lasting benefits of life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has been uplifting enthusiasm for thousands of young girls who now want to start a test force, and it is absolutely awesome.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl power" you showed when you won the Olympics, and that you are motivated by so many different young girls to start their way for good, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and are preparing for new strike.
Ministers wished to vote against the changes in remuneration and working conditions by adopting a renewed agreement with BMA (British Medical Association), but the 37 000 jurisprudence doctor, or 58% of a specialised doctor, rejected the proposal.
Minister of Health Hunt told me in July that the plan was to get the contract out of time and said that the British Public Health System (NHS) was "no country" and that all further delays were harmful to the staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will go to a new agreement containing changes to the practice of night and weekend work in order to improve health care in times of unsociality.
Last night, President Ellen McCourt of the Committee on Juniors of the BMA gave an opinion in which he said: "The jurisprudence doctors are still very prepared for the proposed agreement, and it is particularly fear that it will stimulate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are moved to the new agreement, so now we have to move forward, because the time is running out.
BMA has sought to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has been reluctant to discuss and sometimes not even react in any way.
Despite the fact that last month Jeremy Hunt made a promise that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt has to act now, reverse the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this is not the case, the junior doctors will be prepared for new anti-emergence measures."
At the end of April, nearly 13 000 routine measures and 100 000 reception times were delayed when nurses and consultants were asked to support leaching doctors in the strike.
Ministers wished to conclude a dispute on the changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the staff of the trade union representing British doctors.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 55,000 junior doctors, which would be covered by the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, the Director General of NHS's employees, appealed to the junior doctors not to take new strike.
Mortimer says: "Employment is achieved very little or nothing, but they create pressure on teams and services already on the outermost edges and cause anxiety, distress and disturbances to patients, medical staff and their families.
For the past two months, we have been having discussions with the JCC, and together with the Ministry of Health and other bodies, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the detection of irregularities.
The employees hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues – such as development, flexibility in education, additional training from career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of the programme, study leave and gender pay gap – was a sign of serious compliance between workers, health education and health care contracts with BMA in November, February and May."
In days approx. 2,40 € the liver medicine can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are on their daily intake of approximately 2,40 € of liver medicine when the authorities recommended it to be given to more people and to longer-term use.
The ticagrelor medicine reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or a new heart attack.
NICE (NHS) which is part of the UK Public Health System and assesses the introduction of new treatment methods (NHS) has been advised that ticagreloria should be administered for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Expense) has been advised that ticagrelor should be given for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140 000 people get a heart attack every year, one-quarter of which is a relapse or a stroke.
As a source of heart attacks and stroke, there is a fat agent in the blood vessels' walls that generates posters.
If the plate breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and cause a heart attack.
And if a blood clot is released, it can travel with a bloodstream and prevent blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new scene is greater for people who have been given a heart attack.
The ticagrelor produced by AstraZeneca, which is sold by the product name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of tulips.
Today’s draft NICE guidelines recommend that ticagrelor be administered for next 90 mg for 12 months, followed by a 60 mg dose reduction and a multiple daily dose of aspirin for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, who assesses the introduction of treatment methods, says: "Although effective methods to prevent disease progression and symptoms are available, even one-quarter of heart attack recipients receive a new seizure or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of renewal can have a very negative effect on the quality of life of humans.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for the temporary use of ticagrelor will increase treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
As data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially in the case of bleeding risk, are limited if used for more than three years, it is not recommended to use the treatment method for a longer period of time.
Due to the climate of political correctness, the pollen in Muslim regions fell
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was expelled last year due to corruption, as a result of which the government made a statement.
The climate of political correctness led to the close of the eyes from a wide-ranging electoral field in Muslim communities, revealing the government's report published today.
Sir Eric Pickles, former Minister of Government, strongly criticises the police, election observers and city councils that they have closed their eyes on election field because of the 'previousness and hypersensitivity to religion'.
According to Pickles, known as former Minister of Regional Administration and as a force figure against corruption today, the fear of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to set up security chains outside polling stations to protect scared voters.
He suggests that voters should present a identity card in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter must only state his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that fingers be taped to the unforeseeable music after voting so that no one is able to vote twice.
The publishers should be protected more, says Sir Eric.
He called for suppliers to be able to access government documents and decisions of informal committees and working groups to be improved.
"The aim is not only to prevent elections, but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and the culture that favours them more widely in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report following the vote on the Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court ordered that the then mayor, Mr Lutfur Rahman, should separate himself from his duties because of corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The Court held that Rahman 'siredly' the religious sense of his Muslim community and turned his critics to blame them for racism and Islam.
Rahman was said to be “the basis of his campaign of use as the religious obligation of every religious Muslim to vote for him”.
Up to 300 votes had been questioned or given sincerely in such a way that the person voted to become another person.
According to Sir Eric, there was evidence of the lightning coming from all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the postal festival, where members of high-level members of the Muslim community were told to press the people to vote on the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (in the image) made a number of proposals to clean the voting system, including the requirement for a identity certificate at the polling site.
The report states: "There is evidence that some members of vulnerable ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members, particularly in the Pakistan and Bangladesh-based communities."
"We were concerned that... the state institutions had closed their eyes on such a "politically correct" activity because of the hypersensitivity to ethnicism and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning the processing of postal voting tickets from political activists to prevent the 'voting of votes'.
The report under consideration by Theresa May also calls for more stringent checks to be carried out in the context of the registration in order to prevent the use of the register of voting rights in respect of immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options requiring voters to present a identity certificate before voting.
Wearing the fingers into the unforeseeable muse after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Set a three-year limit for requests for an automatic postal vote.
Disableing the handling of sound and mailing cards sent by completed mail from political activists.
The police have the right to set up security chains around the polls.
Amendment of the Act to increase voting rights, adopted in 1983, makes it easier to raise alarm charges under the Repensation of the People Act.
Prohibition of photography in polling stations.
Only permit English at polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthening training in order to ensure that staff are monitored and that only one person at a time is allowed to go to the polls.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the London police and considers it as a "sufficient" that after the Tower Hamlet case, there were no criminal charges.
"The Court of Justice dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative because of corruption and numerous illegal practices," he says.
"He was found guilty of no doubt, and the threshold of criminal evidence was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticises the ineffective 'reporting checks' of the departments responsible for election lists of the City Council.
"The decision of the Court last year on Tower Hamlet was a wake-up," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all Parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by a worrying and covered electionvil and its denial by some."
The similarity of the Olympic biker with the Duchess Catherine, and the other double beings go wild at the Olympic Olympic Games in Rio
This week, Rio 2016 fans of the Olympic Games fell wild from Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, a French biker whose similarity with the Duke of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to the social media, this 24-year-old Olympic player is not the only athlete fighting for the championship, with a similarity to the person known.
To honor the famous faces of Rio's races and all of our screens, FEMAIL gathered a list of all the Olympic performers whose similarity with Hollywood posters is obvious.
The hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison, the U.S. Men's Force Team, has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to the dual creature of Duke Catherine on the orbital tracks, many people have listed in social media how one of the archbishops could be an actress, Leonardo DiCaprio's twin brother.
Brady Ellison, the U.S. team of men, caused the storm on Twitter after the images he published about him, in which he alarmedly resembles the star of the Wolf of Wall Street movie.
Ellison was aware of the social media and admitted that he had heard from a child that he was like DiCaprio.
"I don't see the same way as it is, except for beards and mustaches," said Brady Huffington to the Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
In London’s 2012 competitions, British long-term jumpers from Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris, no doubt even more are being seen in these races.
Alyya Mustafina, a large- and facial-eyed Russian gymnast, has been called the double-responsor Gloria Estefan, a Cuban-American singer.
Surrounded, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison, known for many years from the Glee TV series.
This user says Nathan Adrian is a "aesthetic version" of the Inception film actor.
Similarly, the similarity between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and the actor Josh Hartnett has been listed for a long time, which is highlighted by both strong angles and lips.
The silver medalist Uinn, the Russian Yulia Efimova reminds us of actress Annalyn McCord, not only because of his beautifully rusty skin and pale hair, while Nathan Adrian, the United States team, according to his fans, is the "aesthetic version of Joseph Gorgon Levit".
These two iron women, Hope Solo (or.) and Dexter series actors, Jennifer Carpenter (i.e.), remind each other of their face shapes and eyes.
Not the only one: this Twitter user was happy when others also saw the sameness.
This user will consider whether there is a good reason for a couple's consistency.
One of the twitter recently expressed its joy when "other people on the Internet agree with Hope Solon and Jennifer Carpenter's uniformity".
The American football star and the Dexter series actor really seem like each other with their face shapes and eyes.
Many have also found a similarity in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney, who won gold, the gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna, and she's coming back!
CBC Olympic Commissioner apologizes to the Chinese swimmer "to death like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth release message, instead of women's 4 x 200-metre free mail, the CBC's direct Olympics were stunned by viewers on Wednesday.
The Canadian public service company CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmers "deathed sharks" and "death like a pig" during the race.
Analyst Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to launch his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200 m free message.
MacDonaldi, who was taken into the CBC's clarity to bring the color, was told to say, "This little Chinese egg 14-year-old, baby.
He was too excited, he left at speed, and he died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, took a message at 1:57.79, and remained 1.61 seconds after Canadian Taylor Ruck, which enabled the Canadians to swim to China.
The viewers from all over Canada react quickly after being shocked by the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane twit: "The CBC reporter just said that a 14-year-old Chinese maid died like a pig??"
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the mission."
Ai Yanhan was described as the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter quickly met with fierce comments from Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his resignation.
The Twitzers didn't hold their words when they heard how reckless Byron Macdonald was.
The writer Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russel, who was hosting the CBC, quickly regretted Mr MacDonald's speeches: "We apologize for the comment on swimming performance.
It was a unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this happened."
In the end, the CBC had to regret more than 90 times the people who had called in the reply to the comment.
Scott Russel, with a commentary colleague, had to apologize for McDonald.
After that, the CBC copied and glued its regret to more than 90 other twitters’ comments, which appealed to the statements made by MacDonald.
The TV company also quickly made a public apology.
"We are sincerely sorry, these statements, and that they were sent.
Last night, we quickly apologized to our viewers, and we also asked for an apology to our social media followers.
In the interests of clarity, Byron’s comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words had to be regretted, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, McDonald expressed his regret in sending and tried to defend his speech by saying that he did not mean it was personal.
"I want to apologize for my comment, which I gave last night after the women's mailing," says McDonald at the BBC Olympic broadcast.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimming pool, not to the person.
Without saying it's obvious that I didn't mean anything with my words, and I'm very sorry."
In Primark, the woman in the middle of the trade was shocked by the customers
Customers didn't know where to look when she was in the middle of Primark to make up for underwear.
He further deteriorated the situation by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, took them off his feet and put them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and finally tried four underwear at a store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkeston.
The Primark chain store at the Folkestone Bouverie Place shopping centre, where a woman tried underwear in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
At the same time, the mother of two children at the store, Jenny Davidson, tells us that after experimenting with her underwear, she was dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells me about what happened: "The people had no faith in their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own trio and her underwear, and put them on.
He did not try to do it unnoticedly, but did it completely without shame.
Everyone was staring when he took out the underwear he tried, and apparently didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it again three times before finally decided not to like them at all, dressed and walked out.
He didn’t seem to care about looks — and he did not think of a person who would eventually buy underwear he had come up with."
The 33-year-old in Kent town, Davidson, continues: "How gross it is to think that someone takes the underwear that someone else has used and has not been washed."
It happened Tuesday afternoon.
"I have understood that the trade staff strived to remove these clothing from the sale after the woman left – what is right.
It would be a terrible thing to take new underwear home and see that someone else has come to them without being washed after that," adds Davidson.
The Primark journalist commented on this by saying: "Primark is aware on Tuesday 9 August of the situation in Folkesstone's movement.
All the products in question have been removed from the sale."
This is how you defend yourself against armed assault with the help of Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the Grand Governor of the Krav Maga in New York, Rhon Mizrach, and asked how to cope with a gun-to-head robber or a assaulter in the immediate vicinity.
The video shows how you can defend the attacker according to whether the attacker approaches you or against you.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and get out of the shooting line, says Mizrach.
After that, hold the gun between your elbow and your shoulder, and strike the attack on your face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker on the knee, and when he goes from pain to two times, shake him on his face with a gun and pull back by holding the gun against him.
The technique is the same if the armed attacker is approaching from the front, and you need to move away from the range, grab the weapon and roll it so that the attacker cannot launch.
At the same time, place your weight in the gun and strike the attacker with a fist into the chest. Turn the weapon away from the attacker's grip, back off, and keep the weapon targeted by the attacker.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video, see how Mizrach does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get rid of the robber by giving up your cash – unless you're Major Krav Maga.
World traveler Ian Wright licks Europe's dirtiest places
The British world traveler put his resistance and the circling reflexes on a hard test by licking the dirtiest and most hostile places in Europe.
Ian Wright, 51, Suffolk’s pilot and travel guide writer, wanted to prove his resistance by licking the strength of the euro banknotes, handkerchief in Piccadilly Circles, the train’s toilet wiper and the Russian public phone.
Before licking Wright measured the targets on the luminometer to see for himself and show the viewers who were banned to push.
The experiment was conducted with a documentary film Ian Wright – followed by internal power, and its results were surprising.
The idea of licking the mouthpiece in the train toilet can be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his way to the different parts of Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals for the confirmation of good bacteria and their own health.
Happily, nothing he licked caused but the mouth of a bad taste.
Ian Wright was originally known for his travel program where he tested the sustainability of his bowels by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
The licking of the handrails of railway stations and the toilet’s pee-pee button, no doubt Wright’s resistance was challenged.
Wright says in the document, "I've been rather anxious about my health since I was a child, and I've put my mouth in all kinds of things like dirt, worms and sores."
In his film, he really showed himself to be taxed.
The border was only received in a congested public bathroom in Russia.
The Luminometer measured over 4,000 units from the sample.
As a result of comparison, it should be reported that the number of hands exposed is usually less than 60.
The border came against the Russian general toilet, where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4,000 units — in the opposite hands, the same figure is less than 60.
Wright adventures together with Valio in a documentary film produced by Ian Wright – After internal force, where the number of bacteria is displayed in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document: "This is almost the smell of the worst smell I've ever smelled in any toilet.
Four thousand units, nothing's more dirty than that!
It's so disgusting that I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced a documentary film, Ian Wright – following internal power in collaboration with Valio.
Wright received lactic acid bacteria and Valio Gefilus containing vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the good bacterial strain and resistance of the intestine.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of the selection of snacks, juices and novelty products, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something fascinating to look at, and at the same time, it tells us the benefits of probiotics.
We used a lot of time to create something crazy, and eventually we decided to ask Ia."
Health in Finland has become a global trend.
"We wanted to bring them into a broader context instead of simply talking about products and to tell us about the good and bad bacteria of our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
Health in Finland has become a global trend, and the document allows us to give consumers more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells us our sense of humor!"
The film directed by Tom Hakala adds to this: "We say that I would have lost my respect for Iani if he had licked certain items we'd asked for, such as a disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the movie.
Naturally, licking some targets was easier for Ian, whereas some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got a part of the dirty arrow tape.
In the 2015 selection questionnaire 84 per cent of respondents added lactic acid bacteria to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent reported that they had at least occasionally used products that have been added to the lactic acid bacteria.
A family of alarms destroyed the city-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall.
After 50 000 pounds of damage to the city's own rental house, the HQ left its behind after they had received the wedding for the terroristisation of the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, have been married after numerous complaints against the couple in Cornwall Saltash.
When the couple had been forced out of the apartment, the representatives of the rental housing company found shocked that the apartment was in repair condition.
On the walls there were insulating openings, flooring trucks had been torn off, the garbage was spread to the floors, and the walls were stunned on the graffiti.
The couple have now changed, and they believe that they live in a private home.
Donna McEvoy, Head of Cornwall Housing (Cornwall Houston) says she's afraid that the apartment may not be saved anymore.
He says, "This has been a full nightmare for people living here, no one should have to endure this kind of thing.
There is a lot to weigh on, as the property is probably not so pleasant as part of Cornwall.
Family is evil, as is its name."
The couple had three boys who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the family had a family's intimidation to engage in street fights in nestball games, intimidation of loved ones, drug use, and communication, as well as loud screaming, quarreling and curse.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease agreement, received the order of non-social behaviour in June.
There were old wastes found in several rooms in the house under the jar.
There were drugs sold earlier in the house, and the floor trucks had been torn off.
According to the neighbors, a family fight on the street and the police were forced to play it regularly.
This week, the Cornwall Home Office evaporated the couple by forced means after giving them an additional 11 weeks to move away voluntarily.
The eased neighbors were grateful for their wedding — they said that their lives were a countrywide hell.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living next door for 20 years, and the whole time has been difficult.
The police have been here incredibly many times."
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we didn't get used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they've finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornwall Housing Office, says that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years during which the police were regularly called.
The garbage and old toys had been thrown into the walls of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is an accident that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her family's behavior, since the decision is always the last measure that Cornwall housing agency is considering.
This was a very difficult case, for behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, the police of Devon and Cornwall and the members of the community who took part in the work and offered us the courage to provide us with information.
I hope that this step forward will improve the well-being of our neighbours and give a message that social behaviour is not acceptable."
Fitzpatrick says that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but they were already twenty.
House with one bedroom after wedding found dirty mattresses
The housing workers now need to clean up the waste bags that surround the house.
The police made the apartment into a raid in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis and also whales and other supplies as well as 1,700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon was fined when he was found guilty of possession of class B drugs for the purpose of selling it.
He claimed the money was in his car accident in 2013 for his dead son Lee Skeldon's tombstone.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and his men have been told to move to a private dwelling in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the rooms were mutilated with graffiti.
The police say they're calling for orders for tenants who break the rules on leases.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police say this wedding is a clear warning to tenants who are constantly undermining the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave how they want without charges, as well as for those who suffer from this kind of behavior," says Crow.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never accept criminal and social behaviour and will continue to cooperate with their partners to protect our communities.
The low-flight, beach-frozen army jet scared tourists in Portugal
The sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in Portugal’s Aveiro.
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane crashed to a desolate low level.
According to the Air Forces, this was an education flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows a moment when tourists were forced into a escape crash when a low - flying jet crashed across a full beach.
The dramatic images show how the military aircraft will become almost full of contact from tourists taking the sun on a sandy beach in the Aveiro of Northern Portugal.
The drivers rose up to their feet, worryingly about the ice of the jet engines, which began to belong before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened last afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the images and videos of the dramatic pastry in social media was Daniel Fernandos, who says, "It passed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it was falling down."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing, and I was sure that the machine would drop on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly came out and flew at a persevering low level.
The Portuguese Air Forces today reported that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which was why the plane had to be so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal, because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires was detrimental to visibility, but according to the Air Forces, this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Forces today reported that, due to the bad visibility of the sand fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight in which the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels.
The result of the first half of the year is better than expected.
In January - June, the social and health border (Eksote) in South Karelia produced a better result of EUR 3.4 million planned.
The result of the exposition was EUR 4.3 million in surplus during the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good for family and social services, where preventive services have been able to break down institutional care by developing them.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, the exotte seeks to shorten the series of measures.
The exit covers the deficit previously created.
The remaining proportion may be used to shorten lines and buy measures for patients.
The result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned for the whole year.
The exotte government will discuss a half-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
Immola took 70 special border guards to swear on the military election.
Of the 70 backup officers at the Border and Marine Guard School, they took a vow on Friday of the military election.
The military election of emergency officers at the Border and Maritime Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th special border ice-circuit lighting event was held in the reserve sports field.
The military whale swore on 70 backups.
Special border guards are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were applying for special border guards.
They were invited to the selection tests at 250.
Special border managers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five times during the war, the veterans of the border forces were involved.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who took part in the event were born in 1918.
A limit of rusty ahead of the crime investigation helps to find out the crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Every 11 police agencies in Finland has been an RTA intelligence and analysis unit since the beginning of 2014.
The operation of the unit is outright invisible.
A total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna are members of the Hämeenlinna police department.
It's pulled by Bay's invested sergeant.
He's the lead officer in Lahti, Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian suit.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and need, considers Deputy Police Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various investigations to other police officers.
Among other things, it has acquired information from asylum seekers.
Reform of the most recent working methods
The establishment of analytical units is a reform of the latest police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. the fact that the police are leaving more and more often, not until they get an alarm.
The information collected and analysed by the unit will target daily police activities where they are most needed.
As part of the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established, less than three national units and each police station has its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR Centre in central criminal police, which is operating in Vantaa, is conducting national activities.
PTR units work under the name of the police, Customs and Border Guard Agency.
RTA units, for their part, work in police-based areas, and it is their duty to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond its territory
Where a single police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA unit's task is to know what's going on in the entire police department area.
Intelligence also extends beyond the limits of its own institution, because that is what crime does.
Those working in the RTA unit have a better knowledge of basic police.
The Unit shall endeavour to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes through registers, alert databases and observations.
This is called "sale", and it is one of the most important tools of criminal investigation.
Everyone has their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the method of making, the author is a certain kind of image.
It may be done on the basis of an act or person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Errors
The RTA unit’s employees do not carry the collars of the city, but their work is not fully public.
Neither own nor the methods used by criminals are reported, because it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to prevent police crime-fighting companies.
The police will publicly report the treatment if it is expected to pose a threat.
For example, this was the case of early summer news, the concept of the labelling of empty dwellings used in housing fractures.
In it, the factors put an apartment in the outer door stick, a double needle or a tapeboard with which they tried whether the residents were really traveling.
The reference material shall be public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals are learning about their mistakes.
The smartest order is the protocol of the court, which may, for example, show that fingerprints have been found in the place.
Next time, we're gonna go to the thieves with our gloves on.
For the purposes of this case, Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppista Hämee Police Officer, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Police Department in Eastern Finland, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärve from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomala from Central Crime Police.
The police will collect and analyse information that will help plan practical action.
In the context of the reduction in labour and financial resources.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was a three-stage PORA reform which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of your own institution and Finland.
The London school girl who joined her father died in Syria
News reports that one of the three British students who joined Isis last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Agent Tasime Akunjee tells the girl's family that Sultana died in Syrian Raqa a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have died in an air strike by the Russians in Raqqa, who is Isisi's base in Syria, told the ITV News on Thursday.
Sultan was 17 years old, and according to his family, he was just planning to escape from a war-broken country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will act as a warning example and a will so that people will understand this as a real risk to the war zone, and who will make people give up the decision to leave," says Akkujee.
Sultana rose in February 2015 with two other Austrian school girls on a plane flying to Turkey and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that sultana had been married to the Isis fighter in Syria and remained widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton supports Garland's highest court if he's elected
According to the Senate Democratic Director Harry Reid, he is convinced that President Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland as Judge of the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Senate Republican representatives have not agreed to confirm Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to Mitch McConnell, the Senate's majority leader, the next president, who is to be elected to fill Anton's Scalia's seat in the second highest court.
At the telephone conference on Thursday, Reid said that he would predict Clinton's choice of Garland with great certainty.
Reid's reporter later explained that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton, whether this is going to be called Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that the Clinton team wouldn't want to "take the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the United States Court of Appeal in the Columbia District of District Court.
Reid says the Republicans that stop Garland from being president of Donald Trump's "gods" and "dedestors".
He says Trump doesn't fit in.
According to Treads magazine, naked calendars belong to women as well as men.
Treads magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemer and brings it to the market in the 1970s style and the 2017 Pirell inspired calendar.
Instead of publishing, they want to find the top models of the next generation of their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
The CEO of Treats, Steve Shaw, earlier this year, told me that his insolent leaf is different from that of the old school Playboys, because he says, "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this for women."
Apparently, he thinks the same about the calendar.
"We must bring back timeless and classical nudity, where women, even men, can easily enjoy and inspire these images of the woman's body," says Shaw in the press release about the calendar.
Women certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art.
Models can be sent to the calendar via the network or participate in open selections in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl charm: Who buys records?
Single, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you have the opportunity to write a comment on your hateful statement with a name No.AllCentralsCentral Men, this argument is based on real research data.
According to the YouGov research company, behind the new coming of much of the vinyl plates, there is not a millennial family boom when the millennials want to know the physical object in their hands, but instead there is a mid-life nostalg.
The age of the person who recently bought vinyl albumin is most likely to be between 45 and 54.
Indeed, age group 18-24 is the least likely buyer.
Moreover, it is not just the desire of amateurs to hug discs, but the importance is emotional: older suppliers of vinyl plates are more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But is YourGov's results true?
If this blog were a television news broadcast, the camera would follow me walking along the lively Soho Street, the gray jacket on my face. I'd be lively, bending my hand into a cup, and I'd say something about tradition, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Even though Soho has slowly lost its charm and fragility, while hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still some special record stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I get very close to the men visiting these stores and try to observe their age and nature.
Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (by two young women at the moment, three middle-aged men) on the Reccles Records movement (by eight middle-aged men at the moment, one probably twenty-year-old women) is on a meeting trip in London for the afternoon and spend extra time on the supply of shops.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I think I'm gonna be," he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 4,000 disks."
These sheets fill his living room walls as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me a picture by e-mail, I did not follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly in his available income. He is now able to buy records he couldn’t afford when they first appeared, and to buy again the things he had to sell when he was young and moneyless.
"I have a lot of stuff in the late 60s and early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that those buying vinyl plates are more likely to be introverts that enjoy their own company, and adds: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my bad."
Wez, 25 working in Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers agree with your Gov profile.
However, he has discovered a new kind of human stream that has been affected by the media beat. These people have heard about the coming of vinyl plates again and now feel forced to buy their old albums back.
"In the light of my discussions, people had usually abandoned their meetings in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyls back," he says.
This may explain the boom of certain ages of vinyl sensitised.
What, then, about the alleged emotional significance of the recordings?
In just a few seconds, you realize in a movement such as Phonica that they provide comfort to the same types of community.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been upset, especially in the non-competition payment system.
The digital world may be perplexed by some of the vinyl fans, to which the return to familiar disc cases means stability and reminds us of the lucky days of youth.
"I think that sometimes a hole or material property will be acquired as some kind of comfort," says Wez.
"I saw it as a collector myself, and I believe so many others.
It's an easy way to get ideas elsewhere."
"We're like social workers!" makes a mess with Wez's workmate behind the record.
The ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of those who bought vinyl albumin last month had not yet listened to their album.
The poll also reported that 41% are a disc player they never use, and 7% of the customers who bought a vinyl plate do not have any own record player.
At this stage, the news broadcast would probably look like a serious face while some of the embarrassing bossa nova collections.
The new arrival of vinyl plates also involves the "pokalic phenomenon", which has been discovered by Jonny, who is currently three middle-aged men, the Sounds of the Universe movement.
"A little customer recently came in and said he didn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead CD so he can put it in his shelf," Jonny says.
"The proportion of such customers is not high, but they do.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our clients say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly teenagers who are just starting a hobby."
The customer community is much more varied in the top to which I come next, and the movement has dedicated an entire layer to vinyl plates.
Customers include 70-year-old ducks, photos of tourists, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers makes it easier, even if the mood is not as calm as the previous movements: the echoing of the extremism of a hot tub jazz instead of Wild Beats’ latest sex with the synthesizer pop.
No customers seem to be lonely, but it is difficult to detect a pale psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the Flip for a few minutes and watching various discounts.
He's more of a watcher than he's doing shopping.
He says his incomes are small, so it's not possible for him to collect records.
"They pay a lot.
It is easy to listen to the music from a computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the wine is ...", he lets the lovely porpoise and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a trade, which is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I can see a bunch of teenage girls who would think they'd jump into the jeans, but who, instead, gather around the Pollaroid cameras for a while, I see a father and daughter who's thinking about buying a Crosley board player.
On the left there is a portal filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac's plates: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the main records for any medium collection.
No one looks at the wall, maybe because they're just a decorating element and a part so high that they're not even higher.
They're pure "art viyl".
However, given that all the means to get attention to these discs may mean more money in the sector and send some customers to the search for Sohoon, there is little reason to complain.
There is no surprise that the population group, most likely to have more time and money than most people, is also the group that spends most money on luxurys, such as vinyl plates.
Although the results of my studies are true, at least in Soho's record movements, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or working life.
They certainly don't spend Thursday mornings painting at Berwick Street record stores, browsing records and avoiding the 30-year-olds who are playing a TV walker, staring intimidatingly and looking at middle-aged men.
Holkeri, i.e. icefish, is the longest live vertebrate — video report
According to researchers, the longest living vertebrate on earth is ice shark.
According to Dr. Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was obtained for the age of 272 to 512 years, which was a five-metre female.
The French court rejected the application for the depot of the jungle camp’s shops
The French court has rejected the application of the Calais authorities, in which they claim that tens of temporary shops and restaurants be torn off by thousands of refugees living in a jungle camp.
At this week's trial, the Calais authorities have argued that the State should be allowed to break down 72 temporary trades in refugee camps, selling various kinds of goods to the refugee camp's residents from tobacco to drinks and offering hair-sleeves, which can buy tea from temporary restaurants with 50 cents or basic meals by a few euros.
According to the Calais Prefectures, these shops and restaurants must be broken down because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and are associated with fire and hygiene.
The humanitarian aid groups told the Court that trades and restaurants are necessary for the camp, because free meals provided by the government organisation and other bodies are not sufficient for the growing population in the camp.
According to them, temporary stores and restaurants often offer protection and free food for those who need them.
The Lille Court decided that there was no legal basis for deportation of 72 temporary traders, but Calais' preferred concerns were "exhaustly understandable".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, camp’s restaurants, cafes and restaurants have a much greater significance than just offering food to people who “live under extremely unstable conditions”.
He says that they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places below the landing was the Jungle Book Kids cafe, which is unprofitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice for hundreds of disabled minors who are the most vulnerable.
More than 170 000 people have signed the address where children’s cafe is required to remain.
According to a letter sent to Guardian, its closure would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Aumberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after the sharp increase in the number of arrivals of the summer, the number of jungle camps has risen to over 9 000.
Food prices fall much faster in Finland than on average in the EU
Food in Finland is much reduced to the joy of consumers and to the harm of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly 5% in three years, as its average price fell by 0.9% in the EU.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one percent more expensive.
Over the last three years, food prices have fallen most in Finland from the EU countries with the same wage level as Finland.
From the comparative countries only in Britain, food prices have fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are reflected in the Ilkka Lehtinen article by Statistics Finland Development Manager, which was published in the Information & Trendit blog.
The newspaper compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportionate to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June of this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation had to be alarmed.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed the turn, after which food had become cheaper a year.
The import bans imposed by Russia on food, which have made food exports from Finland to Russia, are now at a price.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Puint's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in a short term," says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition in industry and trade has also affected the fall in prices.
The large chains of trade S Group and Kesko have both decreased their prices.
The consumer’s price competition has been seen as the most spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not the type of low-cost food, even though food prices have fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland in EU countries with a similar level of pay as in Finland.
According to the newspaper, VAT is significantly affected by the price of food sold in Finland.
He found that if the analogue countries had the same VAT rate, the third lowest food would be sold in Finland from the same level of pay.
The newspaper compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the Veroque countries, only Germans and Dutch people would sell more affordable food than Finns.
"If we want to get to the EU's level at food prices, we must cut VAT on average in the EU and continue the price competition", Lehtinen writes.
The page notes that the calculations he made are indicative of VAT percentages.
The school isn't exactly the same anymore.
Returning to school can be seen as a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum for schools has been developed, which will be put in place at the beginning of the academic year in all primary schools.
It is a guide for all schools in Finland to operate.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and are different from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of beauty is abandoned, and schools instead start to practice coding.
The Swedish rate is already beginning in the sixth grade, and social education is already being read in the fourth grade.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of students.
Before it was thought that the teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from one another.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
The world's most long-lasting vertebrates have been found - icefish can live for up to 400 years
The known Greenland halibut (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches maturity at the age of 150.
It can live after 250 years, report new research.
The figures make the species the most long-lasting spine in the modern world.
In the animal, it is only passed by the Islamic frog, whose oldest known individual has been scheduled to be 507.
The Greenland shark swims down the North Atlantic.
They also have a second record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females are stretching dogs longer, they can grow up to five metres.
Since the rate of growth is slow, only about a centimetre a year according to the monitoring, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen, from the University of Copenhagen, and with his colleagues, found out.
He identified the ice sharks of adults from 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed by the radio-carbonisation of eye lenses.
The average age of the investigated sharks proved to be at least 272 years.
Two of the biggest fish in the sample, 493- and 502-cent amass, appeared to be about 335 and 392 years of age.
As past studies have shown that icebergs are only more than four metres of maturity, researchers calculated that they are about 150 years of age at that stage.
Science published by the research.
You're fired from Stockmann for almost 300, and you're not reduced to sales.
Almost 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann.
Cooperative companies in a company that was in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"The result of these matches is that about 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made as dismissals," Stockmann explains in its communication.
It states that the number of sellers in the goods sector will not be reduced so that the customer service does not suffer.
In addition, some 80 employees of support activities are offered new jobs as a seller.
The Stockmann ytt negotiations concerned some 3,000 employees.
At the beginning of these reductions, it was estimated that there were about 380 employees.
The reduction of the population aims at an annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which will be achieved next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme aimed at achieving savings of EUR 50 million this year.
In the background, Stockmann's difficulties are to make the trade profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11,1 million in the second quarter, trade in goods is still losing.
For Stockmann, according to the CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in commodity stores have not reached the goals set by the company.
"Immigrant reductions are, unfortunately, necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018", says Veijalainen.
The result improvement of the second quarter was mainly due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
Ketju achieved the best sales and results of the second quarter of all time.
The operating profit of Lindex grew by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the total operating result of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year are falling last year.
The operating result of the cut-off is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature below 20 degrees across the country
The low pressure center on the north of Finland keeps the weather rainy Friday, says the meteorologist Ilona Láng of HS.
In the middle of the earth, there will also be rainforests, but the south is the harlot.
The temperature is no longer very summer, as mercury remains below 20 degrees throughout the country.
In northern rain areas, you stay at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya’s General Sports Team shakes dopingscandal - a strange explanation of the coach’s pace
Kenian sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah was a team athlete at the doping test.
The news agency AP told us that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is 800 meters from the star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's land-based team, told me that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a surprise test in Rotichina.
Doping officials came to report to the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home, for he "became off to Kenya's country team".
He played as a athlete, gave me a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept this kind of use", Chairman of the Kenya Olympics Committee Kip Keino, in turn, made a strong effort to reuters the news office.
The Olympics’ general sports begins on Friday, and Rotichin is supposed to run at that moment.
It is not yet known whether the driver is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich settled last year at the World Championships on the way fourth and has pre-meditated Rio winner discounts.
According to Reuters, the source within Kenya’s general sports team claimed that Anzrah went through the athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the racing hall.
When the anti-doping officers met him, they assumed he was a athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to officials because he was afraid he'd be exposed," the source told.
Where is everybody?
Rio’s General Sports Stadium’s void
Where is everybody?
At the Rio Olympic Stadium, at least they don't have any public sports.
In Rio started a struggle on public sports medals on Friday, but the world’s top figures were able to present their skills to an unscrupulous empty viewer.
Rio’s organisers on Friday reported that only 58% of the first day’s morning tickets and 65% of the overnight tickets have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium bullied out of a cheering crowd.
The flags of the finals have already come to an end in Rio.
The Rio Olympic Games have already attracted attention to the sport.
For example, thousands of empty blades have been seen in the sights of rugby, melon, and horse riding.
When Brazil’s mitalitivos Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copabana, only 70 percent of the viewer’s house was full.
After Brazil’s two, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30% of the 12 000 people’s view was full.
At least bad moves explain the fact that Brazil is a long way from fighting economic difficulties to European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympics are strange to the Brazilians who were used to football.
Although even the Brazilian football team, the first match could not have been drawn to the football stadium.
During the weekend, the informant Mario Andrada said that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said after Reuters.
8,2 million tickets for the Olympics in London were sold, although almost half of the total value of tickets was higher than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around EUR 9 to more than EUR 1 000.
More than half the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and army staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Rio because organisers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organisers have given 240 000 tickets to less known species in the school world, such as golf and rugby.
At the Rio stadium, there were empty places this morning.
Not even the beach volleyball in Copaca has been interested in the audience.
Jukka Centralo competed in London in 2012.
All right, I'm done with people on leafy feet.
A new way to protect nature - acquire the right to land
Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
The Foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant habitats.
After that, private, companies and entities can use money to redeem ownership rights in the country.
The foundation has acquired its first land in the region of Lap.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks that will be able to obtain a right of ownership against payment.
The administrator receives 187 square blocks of veto, which in practice means that each holder is not required to be approved if the use of the land is to be modified.
Management rights can also be acquired for several areas.
Acquiring the right to administration is something concrete that can be left for inheritance or given as a gift.
There is no need to go to carry the banderolones or stick yourself to something to protect nature," explains Juha Levovakan.
The acquirer of the administrative right receives precise location information from his block, which allows, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the names of the holders of the right-holder’s rights are displayed on the same map from which the parcel data can be found.
The stone fabric sees its nature protection project as a risk only that the Foundation’s activities will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been set up as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation will somehow act in an ethical or commercial manner, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Haltija project is the protection of habitats so that they can remain intact and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land by buying or donation.
It mainly finances the sale of ownership rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The aim of the Foundation is to obtain more protection countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to move from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Chamber of Commerce on 13-19 August.
The bike thieves torture the big cities, the worst in Turkey - look at the situation in your municipality.
Cycling thieves torture Turkey from Finland's big cities.
This year, more wheels have been stolen in proportion to the number of inhabitants than in nine other major cities.
In the light of the bike thefts reported to the police, the number of bicycles and parts of them were stolen in the 10 largest cities in January to August of this year, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose.
According to police records, there were four out of five bike thefts per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, only about two bike thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities, double thefts are carried out in proportion to the number of inhabitants," characterises the police officer Tommi Reen.
Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more spins have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The generality of opinion can influence how much the city is moving around and how much the wheel is on top of it", says Sergeant Teemu Aikas.
The Tommi Reen of the Police Government is looking forward to the rise in Turku, Helsinki and Oulu.
The number of bike thefts goes much depending on the number of study and cycling cities.
Turku has a large centre, short distances and a lot of wheels for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different kind of city, where city centres are distant and the bicycle is not necessarily a primary means of movement," Reen says.
Throughout Finland, police have become slightly less bike thefts in January to August than in the corresponding period of last year.
Yet there is no cause for joy.
Despite the landing trend of recent years, a little over 20,000 bike thefts will be reported by the police every year.
It means 50-60 Fillars every day and only in Helsinki 4 000 wheels per year.
"They're big amounts," Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more wheels, as only a part of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to make a report on the theft of a bike, even less frequently than every 10 cases reported to the police.
The type of solved bike theft is the kind where the police get information about theft immediately and the thief is caught in blood.
"There will also be other cases in the course of the investigation when, for example, there may be stolen wheels in the drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, cyclists are caught on a weekly basis by themselves in connection with a police investigation, reports Senior Officer Timo Leppämämäki.
He said that wheels would be stolen, for example, from wheelchairs, inner courtyards, warehouses and wheelchairs, in practice, wherever they are normally stored.
Most of the individual bike models are stolen in the same way as the previous years.
The U-lock will give the wheel a better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the wheel, for example, for their own use, but much of the stolen wheels end up selling, for example, via the Internet.
They're going to stay on the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the police that stolen wheels would go much abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finnish.
Some buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of the wheel used must be very careful, for he can commit an offence or a violation.
"The alarm clocks should be played if the decent bikes are sold to their clear bottoms," Reen says.
Special Library official Severi Hirvi wears his colorful Nops for his working day to protect the Kallion Library in Helsinki.
He's had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen, Hirovi tells us. "It's never been taken, there's been a good monk."
Perhaps this does not attract thieves, this may not have hipster value," Hirvi, Helsinki, is thinking.
In the Kiosk located in Kallio, Helsinki, Siiri Valve locked his bicycle in a small u-lock.
Now the wheel was up against the wall, but generally Valve locks his bike in a solid, like a bike.
"There is a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I've ever owned," says the Helsinki student on her white bike, whose body cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time you hear from your buddies that the wheel has been taken."
"Mostly bad spins, such scum-Joys."
On the watch, a bike was stolen from the inside of the house company a year ago.
But the wheel had not been locked, so Valve was able to wait for it to be hanged.
Less than 15 years of age responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-lighting teams known to the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-review team is trying to prevent young people from getting into the crime cycle.
At first, the experiment will apply to persons under 15 who are now without criminal liability.
There's no blood power for the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer-review team will discuss and impose sanctions with the perpetrator.
A week later, the perpetrator can join the peerlight team to make up for his actions.
For example, there may be a letter written to the family explaining what has become and what has been learned about it.
Chief of Youth, Tommi Laitoto says that the model is not tight.
We also have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
"All men are guided in a more responsible direction so that everything does not ruin the first mistake," says Laitio.
A model has been drawn from the United States of America, where it is widely used.
The idea is that young people, not after their first crimes, will be exposed to an adult panel, only reflected with those of the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service design agency that followed the experiment, Palmu’s service designer, Iikka Lovio, tells us that this was an abuse that was successfully resolved.
Especially those under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to keep going on the road you've chosen," Lovio says.
The peer-responsible team is part of the Helsinki project of the Finnish Immigration Service, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new practices are offered to all, not only to immigrant parents.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
From the letter, the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received a draft from it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
They want the party's money to be channelled to the congresses instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his inadmissibility, inaccuracy and record-like unfavorations, threaten to bring these elections to the Democrats a sounding circle," says Politico.
Only to direct all the possible resources to Congress can the Republicans be prevented from falling into the Trump anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election will be reduced by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organised the letter is apparently Trump's opposing Republic, Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress, and that it is not the support of anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump, which are believed to have broken millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials who worked on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trumpi as president.
Clinton promises relief for American families with children.
In the United States, the democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told us about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be President-in-Office so that the U.S. economy can do well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to become president so that the economy can do well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive, $75 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part by rich tax increases, partly by private money.
The construction program is a hand-held service for the American duunars who suffer from the shift of factories to cheap labor countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in good paid jobs after World War II.
We are the builder, we must return to construction!
Clinton said.
On Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday he also heard Sanders stressing that the rich should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if the company goes from the United States to a tax burden, it must pay the income tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"As President, I am opposed to all trade agreements that work against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published before Clinton spoke the Washington Post magazine, Clinton was going to criticise the economic program published by Republican Donald Trump on Monday, saying that it "supervised only millionaires like this".
Trump's proposed reduction in corporate taxes, Clinton, has previously called "Trump's loopholes".
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small businesswoman.
He reminded hearers of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has not paid, and of the clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start making himself products in America", Clinton was hiding.
Such are Rio’s viewer figures: Cats have not glued Finnish around the screens, but they are interested in mobile applications
Usually, sports fairs appear in TV’s viewer statistics as sharpst mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympic Games have so far not reached peak ratings.
At the same time, 12 per cent of the population are attached to the screens: Tuesday night swims followed by Ylen from the Olympics TV2 at the same time 615 000 viewers.
Due to the comparison: the EM events of the month ago received almost 800 000 viewers at TV2, and the EMs in football were quite another million.
The most interested of the Olympic species have so far been biking on Sunday nights, and the fifth day of the race, the gymnasty, which both reached the Olympics at one time nearly half a million viewers.
Yle Sport Manager Panu Pokinen is pleased with the number of viewers, and reminds us that the audiences will be divided into several different instruments for the first time in Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Areena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers choose the Olympic Games at all.
On the side of the television, viewers share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports parties Yle has dedicated a whole channel to.
When the shipment arrives 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500 000, it is a good base.
The number of viewers is smaller than in the 2012 London competitions or the 2008 Beijing competitions, but the difference will explain the time difference - a large part of Rio’s tours will be in Finland during the night.
Another reason for a flat interest - if someone thinks it's thin - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken the first competition on a surprise medal, the interest would have been uphill with it.
In addition, sport is just beginning, as are other Finnish interesting species: sailing and horse riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of viewers at the beginning has been close to the expected number.
When public sports begins, the ratings will explode.
Yle lanseere for the competitions for Yle Rio 2016, which in the first days of the competitions rose to Apple’s App Store for the most downloadable application in Finland.
By Monday, the application was loaded 150,000 times.
I'd guess we're already going to 200 000 downloads.
"The numbers of the viewers of the blood will not be until later," says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not worked for all users, hopefully.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has arrived and the flaws have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been accompanied by a delay and other minor technical problems at the initial stage.
The applications have received updated versions which should correct errors.
The Rio Olympics appear on the Ylen channel and in the arena more widely than any other sports event ever before.
Yle Fem can track some species, and on the radio Yle Tele can pass the races daily.
The Olympics are perhaps the most laborers to Yle ever, including the last ones that can only be traced from Yle's channels.
From 2018 the Olympics can be seen both on Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is the Deepest Lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, Finland's deepest lake is your sun, which has a depth of 95.3 meters on the Crossback.
It could be deeper.
The technical service teacher Matti Kannela found a pressure of about 20 square meters from the Crossside, which was built in depth by a dive computer of 104 meters.
In summer 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre tried to make no effort to strengthen the findings by persuading.
The method does not necessarily find a small depth of 100 metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 m.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 m) and Suvasvesi (90 m).
Over 80 meters goes to Saimaa, Toishves and Lake Head.
They have not been studied as closely as the Sun.
Especially the base of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"It could well be found in unknown depths," Kannela thinks.
If the deep lake is determined using medium depth, it is the Great Lake Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
In this way, your sun will not enter the ten deepest crowds, and Suvasvesi will be further away from the tip.
Correction on August 12 at 14.29: The corrected last piece, where the deepest lakes were wrong.
Low tax sector: Animal taxation is still more intense
Pension taxation is still more intense than wage earners.
The citizen says that the situation was raised under parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was allowed to be equal to the employees.
This is not included in the Board's presentation.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be maintained after the election, he says to West Media.
At the beginning of this year, employees received job income reductions that reduced taxation.
The case was raised in the Parliament by representatives of the opposition, who were polishing the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (Kok.) of the electoral promises.
The purchasing power is secured, it's not growing.
According to Ihalainen, tax reductions are mainly about safeguarding and increasing purchasing power, as next year no increase will be made.
He says that tax reductions have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other issues do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Orpo's message with the desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached at the time of trouble.
He says that holding the contract is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy activity of the Government.
It has been done with the power of social partners, so it must not be questioned.
It will be necessary because the economy is so much in the hands of domestic demand and people's own future faith.
Contamination of long-term unemployment in a dispute
A person calls on the government to address long-term unemployment in the budget dispute, at least to stop it from growing.
In June, long-term unemployed were about 17 000 more than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's goal of rising the employment rate to 72% is to escape.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline in the promise.
Ambassador: Finnish victims are not known for the attacks in Thailand
In the bombings that took place last night and last night in Thailand, at least four people died.
The Embassy calls on the Finnish authorities to take care of their country and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns who intend to be in Thailand to withdraw their journey because of explosives, but it is important to follow the instructions of the embassy with caution, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are very few Finns in Thailand at the moment, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish Thai travel period is scheduled for the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to target the Finns in Hua Hin in particular to find out about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
In general, everything seems to be fine, says Westphalen.
No data on the author
Westphalen says there's no evidence of a hit-in yet.
The Ambassador believes that events may relate to the political rest of the Thai divided society and the last week's referendum on the Constitution drawn up by military junta.
The law was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who said they were against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic conflict related to the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
The Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, earlier attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
There's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
He says the city celebrates Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very limited.
The attacks affect the day's course of action so that the authorities are very precise in terms of safety.
Thai Police: This is not an international terrorist attack.
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from normal terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also excluded, says Thai police according to the AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died in 24 hours, when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
Even the Finns' favorite tourist destination, the holiday island in Phuket blew up four bombs at night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require death victims.
Two of the bombs exploded in the paper, and they say it's inpong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where according to the magazine one person was wounded.
In the popular tourist destination, Hua Hin, according to local authorities, has blown up a total of four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one died in either double-bomb attack.
In addition, in South Thailand, Surat Thani village, and in the city of Trang, at least one bomb exploded.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also known to many tourists, as it is carried to Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao's holiday island.
There is no known cause of the tumours
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the ruling military junta in Thailand is not yet known.
Bombs are trying to create chaos and confusion.
We should not let people panic, he said to journalists.
According to Mr Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, the Prime Minister for Security, at least Hua Hin and Trang, is in contact with each other.
He told Thai BSB that the factors were intended to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls for the attention of Finnish residents in the country to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finns who intend to leave Thailand should not withdraw their journey because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions of caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Europeans affected
So far, very little is known about attacks and their victims during the Finnish night.
About last night's strike in Hua Hin has been able to get some more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded there are at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian.
In the latter attack of Hua Hin, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded near a clock tower known as a visible light.
Thai PBS tells us that the police have isolated Hua Hin from the area where she believes she has found another bomb.
Surading Than's bomb, according to the governor of the county, was hidden in a flower cap.
The municipal employee died in the hit.
There's at least one wounded.
CNN's interviewed chief of police tells us that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded about half an hour apart.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles won women's quadruple
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman was the second point 60.098 and Russia Alija Mustafina third with 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, still pursues telecommunications in Rio's race with permanno, jump and boom.
Biles has ruled the power of women in the past few years.
He has eight personal world stars from three previous seasons.
He has won three times in a row, and the last and the second year of the boom.
In the U.S. team, Biles has achieved two teams of world titles.
The darker MM-millions of Biles have jumps and booms.
Thai Finnish entrepreneurs: "The person has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Thailand's Phuket and children's playground in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I do not believe that this will result in anything more amazing, the assessment of Huovila, who has worked for some twenty years in Asia, as a Finnish company.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen a lot of tragedys near Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bomb strike in Bangkok.
If these have not been banished by tourists before, I don't think so.
Huovila's company's office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack on his own employee.
The employee called about nine local times and said you shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street Bangladesh Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the journeys were set for the queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere was calm and the main loss movement was allowed to open at about ten o’clock local time.
On the beach many had not even heard of the attacks.
Half the time in Thailand during the three days, the traffic was normalized and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila.
Later this car was seen in Krunnupy on the Jouxholmite.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The party found two men suitable for conscience marks hidden in a nearby tree.
The other man was captured right away.
The other one left, but later they found him in the woods using a police dog.
Men are suspected of using a motor vehicle, theft and serious damage.
The police are grateful for the clues.
Research Director on Russian leadership changes: Clear deportation
In Russia, the highest-valued leadership change was made on Friday in years when President Vladimir Putin removed his regime from Sergei Ivanov.
The successor of Ivanov is a 44-year-old Anton Vano.
He's an ex- diplomat, and he's been second-guessing Ivanov.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for the separation of Ivanov can be Putin's desire to prevent strong people from gathering too much power around him.
He adds that recycling management functions is one of the ways in which power is used.
This is a way of preventing people from begging for their own power independent of the President.
According to the Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in the handles with other executives or screwed up.
Arm fire in Ivanov
Ivanov, who is part of the Putin's internal border, moves to specific environmental and transport tasks.
By presenting the state media, Putin said that the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other duties and suggested that Hena be replaced, said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport matters are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian rule.
Furthermore, Ivanov has played an important role in the Security Council of the President.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin at the KGB.
He was deemed to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but becoming president of Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that old maps, such as governors, have recently been exchanged in Russia.
Senior researcher Kati Pynnóniem from the Foreign Policy Institute says that it is more interesting than the heir of Ivanov's place that Putin is to change its surroundings younger.
The Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when retreating from Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to flee to the city of Jarabulus, so that we do not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters received about 90% of the important Manbij city for Daddy.
However, it is estimated that there were tens of jihadites left in the city at that time.
Revised news at 7:30: We were wrong to tell you that civilians were running from town, actually the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled town.
Professor: The Ministry of Interior's Documentary Line is illegal
The line of the Ministry of Interior on the publicity of documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen says to the STT that the document can not be based on the Authority's own guidelines but is based on law.
Formerly, the Ministry of Interior refused to submit a list of participants to Ilta-Sanom at the meetings of the Minister of Interior.
The Minister justified the decision with the Government’s Office’s guidance and the fact that the information had been entered in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's Communication Director tells the STT that the Ministry has identified the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's Last Olympic Show starts in Rio
Like the last few years, Bolt has been running against time.
She hurt her way back from the early days and had to skip the Olympics in Jamaica.
This has not been the perfect preparation, but I'm in a much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
This press conference included low-end pillar dancers and fans.
In Porina Bolt, the bottom line is that the Jamaican star has risen during the period of public sports, struggling with doping scandals and a enchanting interest.
Bolt’s previous defeat at the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he escaped in the early 200 meters of time in 21.05.
At that time, the 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down your injuries and loose training positions.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred metres, where he crushed the world record and the self - confidence of competitors despite the time that was born in the final event of 9.69.
This is harder.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career at the lawpoint at the clock.
World records born in Berlin at 9,58 meters and 19,19 in two hundred are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced his pursuit of a 200-metre world record and 19-second underrun, but no one believes that it was born except Bolt himself.
At the 100th of Bolt, Athens 2004 is the 100th Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year in Beijing's MM-line, Bolt defeated the Americans with only one hundred-piece seconds.
In the course of his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost even during the finals of the prize competitions if only it has been possible.
In Däänu 2011, the 100th MM-line was left out of Bolt because of the lightning blast.
Bolt fills in plenty of weeks after 30.
He's an old man of young men, and Rio's race is his last Olympics.
In London, the final goal line of the career, Bolt has set the World Cup next year.
These are the Olympics who separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm in the subjects, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the interview with Sports Illustrated.
Shows about Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping offences
According to the Chinese National News Office, Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
There were traces of banned substances from Chen Xiny's doping sample.
The Bulgarian drinks, Silvia Danekova, are also suspected of a doping crime.
In addition, the Keni sports coach was posted to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of a athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given me a doping sample with signs of the epo hormone.
He was fourth in Rio at a women's 100-meter butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese maid has taken his doping case before the International Court of Appeal of Sport to the CAS.
Xinhua tells us that there have been evidence of a diuretics called hydrochlorothiazide from the Xiny on Sunday.
In Rio, other doping suspects have also appeared.
BBC reports that Bulgarian female cheeses Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
Kenia has, on the other hand, sent her home from Rio to the public sports coach because of the doping crime.
On Thursday, the International Olympics Committee KOK told us that the Kenyan coach had become a athlete in the test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, this is the Chinese fast-run coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used a thousand feet of Ferguson Rotich's race.
Phelps isn't gonna stop anything - historical gold came into the acting style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, the United States Michael Phelps swims 200 metres in a mix of 22nd Olympics in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympics already.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer of the same species in the fourth consecutive race.
Phelps's winning time was 1.54,66.
Kosuke Hagino, Japan, was placed in confusion second before Wang Shuni, China.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, Helen Skelton, the BBC Olympics, laughs at the newspaper's quick interview.
The case of Helen Skkelton (i.e.) on Monday is the most outstanding story of this week's newspaper website.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't have much stress if there's a small amount of noise in the sow or the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
It's a visual media, he insists.
Skkelton has been dressed in high-level shoes and shorts for at least enough exposure to at least a number of conservative British soldiers.
But there are no back steps.
It's important to look good, and the little talk is just a fun thing.
I'm sure Skkelton wants to scare me, and maybe he's a little bit upset, but he's insisting that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the trial has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that places attention to how hard these swimmers are doing and how big sacrifices they make is for me, Skkelto is agitating.
You know what?
It's all about nothing if it comes from wearing a driver.
I'm a little amused if someone's ever hit one of them.
The Rio police made two arrests for a terrorist attack.
On Thursday, Rio's police announced that they've arrested two people for a terrorist attack.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the race.
In the same connection, the police made five other arrests and questioned two people before they were released.
All the suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news page, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group that was arrested by the police in July.
The arrests are believed to have links with the Isis extremes.
Of course, the arresters had reduced violence in social media.
Messages that called for violence were disseminated, among other things, in the WhatsApp service.
The safety of Rio's race is equivalent to 85,000 police officers.
Police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their battles in an empty hall on the early block of the Rio basketball tournament on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and shut down the place from the audience.
The police let the public in after a controlled explosion of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympic Games when the police performed a controlled explosion mission.
The police shut down the arena because of the suspicious package they found there.
The audience got in after the police had controlledly blew up the package.
The audience did not record the viewer by the beginning of the match, because the police closed down the arena because of the suspicious package found in the arena.
The police blew up the package and released the public administration only after that.
The drink woke up the race to the Spanish team that began sleepily.
With two losses, the race started by Spain won Nigerian points 96-87.
In the previous two races, Spain reached silver.
For the third time during the summer race in Rio, the police performed a controlled explosion mission.
Last time, the police had to blow up a suspicious find in the vicinity of the road bike destination last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their battles in the early part of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty viewers.
The Argentinan lady stabbed Petija-Siren - a Finnish man was thinking about the protest
The Tuuli Petator-Siren had a colourful competition day in Rio.
The wind of Petija-Siren was hard on Thursday.
The Argentinian lady stabbed the Tuuli Petator-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the day of surfing women.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant gave me a breach.
He was caught because of the crash, and others ran away, the Finnish chief coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
The athlete considered the protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing so because it would have been useless according to the Olympics.
I should have dropped into the water so I could get credit, Petator-Siren said.
The Finnish hanger was hanging on his desk until the last time, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnishman was left with the crash instead of 27.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic Warhead Medal is eight.
In relation to the pain, the crash didn't seem very much.
Friday is an important day when you're racing 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petija-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, extend age
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years to the life of a person.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life is extended.
Sometimes things that cannot be affected by a person can bring him more years.
These include a tendency to medium body muscle or social status.
Regular shopping may extend your age.
You don't always have to sneeze, just to pick up the milk.
A long-term secret has been sought to resolve many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most strange research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drink of beer and coffee
Coffee drink has been found to protect from cancer, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
Research at Harvard University stated that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "low risk of death", particularly in terms of neurological or cardiac diseases.
On behalf of the alcohol again, there are studies that show that judicial use - one of three daily doses - may extend life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived as parents as people who did not drink at all.
The normal use of toothpaste can extend the life of a person even by more than six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents infections.
On the other hand, they can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases in other parts of the human body.
The study carried out in Norway explained how laughing had an impact on human life.
Over 55,000 people were monitored by the project that lasted seven years.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when sexual protection is taken into account, is good for health according to many studies.
In addition to everything, it can also extend your age.
Unfortunately, it's just not enough to have sex as it is.
In order for a person to have more years of his life, he should also receive orgasm.
Mobility will, of course, bring additional years, it will not be contested.
However, reaching a long-term age does not require absolute sovereignty.
One study at Oxford University found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
Their bodies also had more omega 3 fatty acids.
The same study connected these aspects to lower mortality.
Whether it was a athlete or Oscar who won the Olympics, he is more likely to live longer than the usual bull.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation can be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring his life to more years.
Some researchers doubt that a long-term age is the result of a person's social status, which, for example, contributes to the pursuit of recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping practices for people over 65 years of age found that a person shopping daily, i.e. probably a parent who makes shopping less often.
This is because rounding in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may trigger death.
So count the credit card from your hand... online shopping is not the same.
The dead-human race went down towards the truck
There was a serious truck and passenger car in Koske on Friday night.
The accident occurred at Koske, between Kostken and Sorvaston on Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving towards Forssa, when the passenger car received was on the same track, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck went down after the crash, and it's on it, but it's on fire.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car went down and over and over and over again on the roof.
A woman who was born in 1972 who was driving a passenger car was bitten by her car.
The rescue facility removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Hospital.
The result of a female blow test was 2.22 prommel.
He's suspected of being in a serious race.
The mail sent loose candy to the wrong city.
There were deficiencies in the selection of Salon K-Citymarket’s bulk box, since the mail had delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki by mistake.
Teija Haltia, who lives in the family, was on Thursday to buy loose candy from Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign came to my eye.
Unfortunately, there are product shortages in the raccoon because the Post delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when the Post gets delivered!
So, if you don't rub in the lawnmower, it's on the sign.
The merchant’s sticky sign relates to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to cover grass-cracking.
The grass can be found in the Post's offer until the end of August.
Haltia felt that the sign was mainly fun and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update hit me with an abyss.
The media has also been calling all along, and the attention raised by this is amazing, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, the update of Haltia had over 700 divisions on Facebook.
Haltia got her favorites caught in a plastic bag, even though a few of them were empty.
Jaakko Kaadeno, responsible for the business of the Transport Services of Post Enterprises, was sorry for the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stage were deported to the wrong place (Sinajoki) yesterday, and we no longer went to do a partial delivery (Saloon) on three, but we only took five stage today, and Kadesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
It's the first time I've heard of it. It's the first time I've ever heard of it.
The girl Haltia didn't get nervous about the sign because she found all her own loose-eyed scarves in the selection.
Very thinning! 30 kilos lightened Lotta Backlund published a photo of his change
A comedian producer has spent tens of pounds after the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of a change in life.
Lotta shared the photo pair's change on Friday in Instagram.
In the spring, Loto was in the gym, and he was looking for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Koomakoko, TV producer Lotta Backlund started his weight loss in 2009.
He's a total lifestyle change, and he's lost his little mouth for thirty kilos.
Friday Backlund published a very high performance photo pair on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed from her appearance over the years.
The Backlund couple, before and after, has collected a number of praiseful comments from the co-rapporteurs.
You're amazing.
At the same time we're on the same road, the motivation is tough!
Pia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in this project now.
I get the strength and enthusiasm of your images while I'm on the same road, the other tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last few pounds, let's do it on the project now.
At that time, he told the newspaper that he wanted to finally get into normal weight, which was ten kilos away at the time.
During three months of fitness, the pounds finally fell by five.
The hope of a woman who was murdered in Lovis: the memory of the victim for the benefit of police dogs
A week ago, a 42-year-old woman murdered in Lovisa hopes that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and addresses by donations for police work.
Sipoon Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update, which conveys the wish of the victim's family on donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked at the Sipoon Veterinary Station as a substitute and also carried out his nursing training there.
The vet's office reminds me of the words that touch the woman.
Happy, smart, sense of humor and work intimidating.
That's a good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
It is mentioned in the report that the donation allowance is entirely for police dogs, primarily for the acquisition of security vests.
Last Friday, 42-year-old Lovisi was murdered in her own house in Lovisa Koskenkyla.
The women's neighbors have told the newspaper that the victim was a very animal.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, hens, and flowers.
A 27-year-old man who was suspected of murder didn't know a woman and had no connection.
The killer's tracking involved a police dog named Börje, who was life-threatening in the arrest.
But the Börje survived and is recovering.
The Court of Justice delivered a judgment to Post on an infringement of the Equality Act
The post did not have the right to arrest the employee who refused training, to judge Kanta-Häme’s court in his judgment.
The Court of Justice required Post to pay most of the employees the paid salary and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Posti could only have arrested a part of the employee’s salary, which corresponded to the proportion of the study being carried out throughout the day.
According to the judgment of the Court of Justice, the worker had been placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity, contrary to the Act of Equal Opportunities.
The staff member had complied with the PAU’s decision on a ban on education and training in the postal and logistics sectors.
During last November's postal service, the PAU decided that Post workers would not be familiar with the rent workers who broke the strike.
It's the first news of the People's News.
Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey should return to the path of democratic and respect for human rights, write to Prime Minister Juha Sipil (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (p.p.) in his reply to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree with the human rights situation in Turkey.
In his letter to the Journalist Association, Sipila and Soin asked him to express his concern for Turkey's freedom of speech and of the press.
Sipilä and Soini inform Finland that Finland has repeatedly brought forth the importance of freedom of the press and of the expression.
Putin separated his regime from the master's position in the Estonian State of Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has resigned Sergei Ivanov, the President of the President, says Kreml.
This is a Soviet-Viro Communist leader, Karl Vano's grandson, Anton Vano.
He is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been the Deputy Head of Presidential Administration since 2012.
It will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the news office Interfax tells us.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration to the chief.
According to Kremlin’s notice, Ivanov, belonging to the close internal border of Putin, will be transferred to specific environmental and transport tasks.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other duties and suggested that Gono be replaced, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the KGB's spying with the Soviet Union.
Many considered Ivanov as a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but therefore becoming president of Dmitri Medvedev.
Ivanov was appointed as President in 2011 before the re-election of Putin as President in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant prize for a game ban will not be seen in Valoliga's opening
The world record of football transfers will not be seen on the field when the UK Valoli is kicked out for the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed England.
Because of the ban, Paul Pogba is on page at the ManU opening his league Sunday against Bournemouth, he told BBC on Friday.
According to the British Media, ManU paid the Italian Society of Pogba EUR 105 million to Juventus.
However, the UK football union FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was under a ban from Juventus.
He received two warnings from the Italian Cup last season, and it becomes one game ban.
That game ban has been transferred to England, the FA told BBC.
Pogban’s next port to play is the second round of the league on 19 August, when ManU meets Southampton.
At Flow, the madness of magnitude is a virtue.
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the Flow Festival position as an internationally appreciated event marked by the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
In a typical way, the painters have expressed themselves with their own self-sufficient dress.
One of the main stage artists is this year's punk legend Iggy Pop.
The event area of the Flow Festival will be preserved, among other things, by artificial grass and art installation.
It has never been enough for us to have only the main ship and the beer plate, says the artistic leader of the event Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Summer Bay of Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would the authors themselves want to go?
It's kind of strange in the uneventables, that's what we're thinking.
Often the aim is to achieve the level of necessity and operate in accordance with official regulations, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would come to the end this year too.
The goal has been to raise the number of 70,000 visitors last year by 5,000 people.
A number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists are also seen in Festare this year.
The growth of the number of visitors is a good thing because there is some need to fund it.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much because, at some point, mass would be like a cattle flock, controlled by a vast section of the road.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of the successful event has been bloated over 13 years with 130 performers, art collections and numerous restaurants and drinks in the area partially covered by artificial grass.
In addition to the main and smaller fields of performance, this year 15 000 people’s tents operate.
Kallio admits that the event could be more simple.
Maybe I'm a little bit big, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If it disappears, it's not our thing anymore.
The greatest pleasure and reward for the work done is that today, even the great visions are practically possible.
During the early years of the 21st century, activities depended very much on the support of the City of Helsinki of about EUR 20 000.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was around EUR 6 million.
It allows you to create "crees even things", as is the building of that 73-metre wide tent.
The visitors of Flow have typically expressed themselves with their own self-sufficient dress.
In addition to the music event, the community of trendy young adults can be discussed.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as being particularly fashionable.
We want to break up, above all, with content.
Yet the fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the art of the main ship is the legend of a dozen, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he doesn't have the most typical performers of Inderock, Pop music, rapper and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was stunned because this is probably the last time this is seen in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
It's not just what they play on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good, and he's been doing some damn good jobs in the last few years.
The bombs in Thailand's tourist paradise had been hidden in purses - tourists fled in horrors
In Hua Hin, local time blew up two bombs on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the hit and more than 20 injured.
The bombs had apparently been hidden in a flower bag and blew up with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreigners.
They were bombarded at the same time that tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, the police representative, Samoer Yoosumran, according to CNN.
Since 1989, the protector of wild animals, Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, referred to the attacks as a large picture.
If the TV doesn't look good, you can look at it.
There were at least 11 foreign tourists injured in Hua Hin.
The people ran against me and said that the bomb had exploded at the bar.
It took place in one of the biggest bar streets, told Emeli Olsson Aftonbladet the Swedish secretary.
The next morning, the local time blew up two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, even the Finns popular Phukett on the island of Phukett blew up two bombs.
No one seems to have died.
At the same time, Hua Hin had another double-bomb attack.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police told me that they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that hadn't yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, behind the bombings, there are likely rebel troops who are not satisfied with Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, this may also have criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been very vulnerable to trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new team of emergency forces comes first to battle in a war situation
In the acute military situation, guards are told not to engage in battle duties until several months after the wedding of the military election, says the Central Finn.
According to the Chief of Defence, Brig-Gen Jukka Sonninen, who has been interviewed by the newspaper, for example, for a period of 5.5 months of military service in the military situation, only those who are at the end of their training are eligible.
According to the Head of Education, the first member of the emergency crew shall be provided with a reserve.
None of the reserveers or reserveers are ordered to perform a task that has not been trained as required, says Sonnen.
In the past summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces are going to train backup personnel to immediate capacity units from next year.
The units may, if necessary, be used in military operations already during military training.
Pamela Tola got a giant raise from home
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, Pauli Waroma, have won a hard fight at the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The commercial price of the double-stored separate house had been EUR 330,000.
However, after commercialisation, the house revealed a serious moisture problem that caused health-threatening microbi growth.
The couple had to sell the apartment as a depot in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so financial losses for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple brought the case to court and asked the seller to make a price reduction.
The salesman denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in the tip and in the court court.
The court delivered the judgment on Wednesday.
It was in force a judgment of the court of the Supreme Court which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for a discount.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the trial and liquidation costs of the couple.
The Court disproportionately explained the price reduction because some of the need to repair the dwelling had already been known to the purchasers when making the sale of the dwelling.
However, according to court’s law, the damage to construction was significantly more serious than what had been proposed.
Tola was looking for a place of good faith.
Tola told me in court that the couple had specifically sought a home of good faith because they did not want to enter repairs.
He had been established with the idea that the building had been renovated and in good condition, and that the facts mentioned in the report on fitness checks were no harm.
The municipal inspection report mentioned the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of water flows along rock studies.
However, the discussions did not show that it had been a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma felt that rainwater from the rock might have to be controlled a little over a few years.
Shops were made in October 2009.
Within a few years it became apparent that the problems of the humidity of the dwelling were much more serious than they thought.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed microbi growth, which, according to the Witnesses, was caused by both the rock rainwater and the capillary rising from land pollution.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector’s assessment, reach indoor spaces also through the receipts.
The sands that allow health risk, exceed the limit values, were found in the silk samples in the home room, in the basement stairs, in the living room window and in the basement laundry room.
The Terassas were built without permits
The Court also contested whether the dwelling had been in breach of the extended building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision to change the property.
Among other things, the steels had been built, even though the relevant permits had not yet been granted.
However, home problems were essential in court.
According to the court, the purchasers could assume, on the basis of the information they obtained before trade, that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for measurable repairs in the near future.
The Court of Justice did not consider that there was a particular reason for a more extensive inspection.
The participants have not failed to comply with their reporting obligations, the court finds in its judgment.
The creepy archive: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for the Nazis - also Finns in the register
Editor Christopher Andersson writes in his recent Dagens Nyheter's article on how documents recorded for microfilms in the United States' National Archives in Maryland relate to a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry the SS men.
Most women are Germans, but they also include Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danishs, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finnish women, and 31 Swedish women were wanted.
Documents and registration cards come from a breed agency operating in Nazi Germany.
The breed agency was head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man was allowed to have children in Nazi Germany until he was examined by a SS doctor.
The same applies to women who were to be able to bear even more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynecological studies to determine the case.
The breed agency examined the backgrounds of women by studying church books, among other things.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the female family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up Swedish citizenship and to give life stories and good recommendations from close relatives to the breed agency.
The agency wanted guarantees that women were "children", "sustainers", and "good national socialists", who were very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as Morsam of SSmen.
The article does not tell us what happened to 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a state-sponsored programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme provided, among other things, that each SSman should have four children, whether married or outside.
The Lebensborn homes care for children and mothers born outside marriage.
However, the programme was not actively promoted, the pages of the U.S. holocaust Museum are reported.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The State encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The German mother’s honorary body was awarded to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between the Aryans and the non-Aryans were legally prohibited, and the museum’s pages are found.
And the sixth of Siren, and Nirkko rose, and fell.
Tapio Nirkko placed the third sailing day on the first departure of Finnjollien at the Rio Olympics, but remained the whole group at the end of the day’s second departure.
In the overall situation, Niko rose eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him in place at 14.
The wind of Petija-Siren fought at the departures of RS:X, positions 17 and 3.
In the overall situation, Petija-Siren is six.
In the 470s, Jonahs and Niklas Lindgren remained at the opening stage of the day 23.
In general, Lindgreni is ranked 19.
Jari Sillanpää Satulinna was recorded at night for a couple of hours: "I was so full of candy."
Jari Sillanpää has been a member of Finnish favorite artists for more than 20 years.
From a barmaid in 1995 to a tango King, Sillanpää, who was best sold by Finland as a solo artist, and the star of dance bars and festivals, continues to drill and is currently in a wild upstairs.
A book about Jari Sillanpää, a favorite singer's life, was published today in Paljaana.
The book Sillanpää tells of his life and career as good as bad.
The career of Sillanpää rose to a total rise in his victory on the Seinajoki market in Denmark in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuppamäki had written to Sillanpää at the request of a man in a tango piece, which Kassu Halonen agreed in a slightly different form.
As a result, Satulinna was one of the most popular pieces in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly according to the plans: Sillanpää sang it on the tape in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so full of cake!
The bridge head remembers in the book.
You wouldn't think it'd be in a hangover if you'd put it on fire.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, it was still good.
I learned that you don't have to insist on being perfect and perfect all the time.
Another event related to the most popular songs in the book that is reported happened nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then partner, and the case eventually ended up in the texts of the gold piece that were published in the single one in 2014.
The book tells us that Sarah’s song collections were not exactly what Silas would have wanted.
She had imagined that she was making a record of her own life as a true story, but the words of the separate song were not true, but it was written on the basis of the magazine 7 days ago.
In the news of the newspaper Jari and her ex-love, Jari was told about excessive partying and drinking, but Jari said it was a full stick and that it was not true.
Jari said that he was mad at the record company and refused to sing a song, but eventually he ended up singing it, and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
At the end, 52% of voters were in favour of a difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the opinion of the week was expected to have the opposite result.
The British eco-nomics and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institution or university flagged the difference in favour, although two individual researchers could disagree with the power flow of their profession.
The 'It's the economy, stupid' of the British Brexet vote, was the subject of the recent election campaign by the former US President Bill Clinton.
Economimists were shocked when their voice was not a part of it.
They were shocked when the economy did not appear to be the most important issue of politics.
From the economic curfew
Centre for Macroeconomics tiva in the latest monthly survey of professional answers to Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not heard and heard because this time the voters decided on non-economic grounds.
One explanation of the loss of economic position is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, which is almost standard.
If the immigrant gets a job, it'll be out of the right British.
Many people also have the idea that a fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, the voters did not believe the economic arguments, since the consensus of economials was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, they were deported by the BBC's equity, which provided only as much space as a few per cent of the EU's disparity with economic scientists from the economy as the overwhelming majority.
The EU's hate press was not interested in telling us what IFS, ISM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other differences in economic accounts are.
These far-reaching combinations spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if it was both heard and understood by the Ekonomim messages, they were not transmitted because the economials represent an elite with which voters do not have a common interest in their own eyes.
The academics such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small cities and rural areas the message was not effective.
Immigration is also an economy.
The overwhelming argument of the Brexit vote on the issue of immigration.
Immigrants take your job, the immigrant destroys your hospital, the immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Each cafe has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to have medical appointments if they didn't have them?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place to go to school if they got rid of them?
In every municipality, there are foreigners.
How much more space do you guys have if they'd get out of here?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists were unable to respond to them, and if they did, their responses did not get visibility.
The economists were unable to explain that British immigrants have more jobs, less health centres and more money for education and social security.
Migrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the UK public finances and their consumption generates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund reserved for Brex
One of the funds was the Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments correspond to the Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, in Aberdeen, he was able to prepare plans A and B in time for Brex.
A few weeks before the vote, the plan for the victory of the B camp, which is to be supported by the EU, started to be more specific in case the result was low.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
As a rule, real estate funds do not have extensive liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on Day 23, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, the Old One says Aberdeen's only open-ended daily notes about the real estate fund that the news were about.
According to the old man, the normal level would be between 15 and 20 per cent.
At that time, the value of the fund was EUR 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is about 20 billion dollars.
It was the highest number of real estate funds in nine open real estate funds, and Vanhanen says of all the open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10 % or even below.
The real estate funds were therefore very strategically reserved for Brex.
Money closes trade
When the EU-different camp won, Europe went into a mess.
However, less than two weeks after the vote on the real estate market were quite peaceful, the Old One says.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech of the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, in which he estimates that Brext could be a big risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the real estate funds first, Standard Life, frozen their trade.
Together, these guys took over the situation and brought the case to the main points of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared between 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calm, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started to roll, and after that, the fund had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but eventually it had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close down trade, but changed prices downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out of panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't be worth it, because it would cost you losses.
It calmed the situation, and most cancelled the notification.
Since then, it was quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks, says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, the Manner-Europe Funds in Aberdeen had no similar impact.
However, there were a lot of questionnaires.
Unforeseeable attention to real estate funds
According to the old man, closures of real estate funds were disproportionate.
The open funds covered by the closures are managed by about four per cent of British real estate.
The closure of Aberdeen lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its fund for 2017.
At present, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not appear to be much more "for Aberdeen".
The major issues now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
In addition, there is a 15% discount on the market in relation to the period prior to the Brexit vote.
The Dollarist can now buy the same property by up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, says Vanhanen.
Brexit brought in some of London's real estate markets
At 2:00 a.m., the situation didn't look too much.
But at 4:00, when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for real estate investment in the British Real Estate Fund of the Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's your word.
I realized this is going to Plan B, and Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He was headed for work right away.
London City was already fully alive despite the night of the morning.
The TV screens normally set out to be non-voting at the office supported the news, and usually the sounding people were silently listening when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell us about his divorce.
When the market opened, the evidence signs flashed just red.
It was the morning he never thought he was alive, the Old One says.
It is not, however, that despite myllery, Aberdee, one of the UK's largest real estate funds, finished two real estate trades on the day after the Brexit vote.
It was a mess.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and therefore the situation was kind of calm, says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote began with the correction movement
The vote followed the storm.
Panda collapsed, British leadership went to change.
The market started to anticipate harsh invoices on the British real estate market, especially in London.
At London office facilities, up to 20% of mines were expected in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the storm has fallen, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
It does not show, though, its last summer holidays this week in Helsinki on the faces of Vanhase.
In his view, it is still too early to say much about what comes from Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already been first reported.
The CBRE data on price developments in the real estate service company cover about one third of the market.
According to them, London's prices of all properties decreased by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office building, minus 6.1 per cent, the Old One reads.
The figures aren't that bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index was published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All the same dropouts hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, too, that Brexit was compared very quickly to Lehman's fall and the global economic crisis that began on the US real estate market.
The old man feels that the comparison is not quite a match, as it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
There's another mood, too.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
There's a lot of money, too.
In any event, the repair operation could have been in the way
In fact, it's not a miracle for him to be in front of him without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of real estate in London and other world cities have been too high for years.
For two years now, we have said that City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the drop was really high.
London prices have been written up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, so has London's population.
Another big trend is that properties are the last class of ownership that globalises, says Vanhanen.
New players have become on the market from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate sites abroad.
London as a known city is an easy target.
In addition, prices have been fed by a low rate of interest, which has led, for example, pension companies to look for returns on new sites.
On this point, the loan has been easily available - although the debt gap has been used by Vanhasen now much less than during the boom before the crisis in 2008.
Disperse, disperse.
In London, the rise in prices rose last summer, Vanhanen tells us.
Even Aberdeen began to reduce his ownership in London, and last year he was a net seller.
There was some kind of turning ahead, and now it came.
What's from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He's not afraid to judge, but he says that there's hardly any rise in it.
The feeling suggests that there is a downward or a level playing field ahead.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the hole is being survived at work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global dispersal.
If you've invested in one market, it's too much of a sacrifice.
If you've broken up, the risks are also decentralised, the Old One says.
S-Group starts to register the purchase data in more detail
As soon as the S-Group knows what you eat, today the trading group has told us that it will start to collect more accurate information about the purchases of its customers.
So far, when data on the final amount of receipts have been collected, the group will start in early May, also for the products purchased.
The S-group will come here after Kesko, because the data on the goods purchased with the plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitalan, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data shall be collected with the consent of the customer and used on a licensed basis for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
A little customer has denied the use of product information, Riitala says to the Economic Area.
According to him, Kesko is not going to respond to Group S registration change.
Kesko has already classed its customers according to only the food purchases into ten groups.
The classification shall be updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money they spend.
The data are used for the purpose of marketing for the customer.
The product-specific purchase data shall only be collected from the K-group’s own chains.
Cooperation partners such as Neste Oil do not provide any information.
Lidl Finland has no master client program and no such program is planned.
Finland's Middle Market has its own "Ykkösbonus" customer program, which can be linked to Valtatalo, Siwok and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect product or product group data, we remain at the end of the receipt.
So we know where the purchase was made, and that day, and the final sum of the customer's receipt.
We haven't gone to that level like a group K or a group S, says commercial leader Anu Ora.
He said that it is intended to be a reform of the customer programme in the future, but the Middle Market will tell you later.
However, Ora does not promise to register product information.
First try
To date, the SOK's customer ownership and customer registration has been relatively wide.
In addition to personal and address data, basic information has included the profession, education, housing and children’s birth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The purchase of S-Ecurities has been recorded on the date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of purchases and the method of payment.
In addition, data from S-boning partners have been obtained from their cash-systems.
From May onwards, purchase data at product level will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismos, Kod Terro and ABC chains, data are currently recorded at product group level.
For a longer time customers have had hopes that marketing could be more focused, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Owner and Partner’s Business of the SOK.
Group S says he's informed about the change he's made to his customers.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data are recorded in cats in any case, whether they want it or not.
The person who wants to check the stored information can be found on the S Group website.
For example, the cashiers do not access the data, stress Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-puptu is Customs's latest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The Black Labrador-outer’s puppy is enchanted by five similar cases of rowed box at Helsinki Airport.
It won't take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with his favorite toy.
In the box next to which Heila sat, a jar of shells smelling on the square gas was revealed.
The fumes are the first smell of what has been practiced with Heila now, says Suntio, the owner of Heila dog.
Safety situation and access to online commerce
Heila is the first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and is placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The work might take Heila and Suntion to other crossing points and ports as necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main job as the international security situation has changed due to major terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused the measures and attacks in Tull, which have been confirmed, says Telli's supervisor Mikko Grönberg.
Another access to training for weapons and explosives dogs is mailing via Helsinki Airport.
As a result of increased internet traffic through airport, up to 40 million mails are carried out annually, including arms and explosives from abroad.
In recent years, the customs authorities have made a search for approximately 300 weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives related to online shopping, passenger goods and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It's going to investigate registered baggage and mailing.
In port it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and label areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the track performance, Customs assesses whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg has a hopeful attitude to the idea.
School in Kirkkonumme
Heila-pennunuku's training is coordinated by the Tullin Dog School in Kirkkonnumme.
Suntio also attends training with Heila at police and defence experts.
Police have strong experience in training dogs and defence forces with expertise in explosives.
Customs will decide together with other authorities what smells Heila are taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues in Helsinki Airport are Tullin's six drug dogs, as well as the Money and Drug Dog Mass.
Labrador extractor Heila has been chosen from ten puppy dogs.
The selection criteria for the dog selected for the airport include the pick-up and hunting net, as well as the peace, because the dog is involved in weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, home to Suntion, is a close associate of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing without Heila gets home, Suntio laughs.
These fine orders go to Heila from a time frame.
The cameraman of the evening Sanoma will lose the camera cover for the fast dog, but Heila will return the soft toy from the "irti" command immediately.
Hard competition from working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still standard tests ahead, next October, which assesses whether training is sufficient for the necessary tasks.
Heila can be seen at work in Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes well according to the plans.
Regrettably, passengers cannot come to iron their work vests on a dog, like Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is around EUR 60000/year for customs.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they retire for the care of their owner.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active participations last for only ten minutes.
The owner of working dogs is a tough competition in Tull.
Heila owns about 20-30 Customs employees.
Lucky hit Suntion, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and surveillance tasks in Tull.
The state has its first Olympic medal - the people will have a day off.
In Rugby, the Olympic Olympic Olympics in Fiji, less than one million inhabitants live, are so highly appreciated that the government has appointed the 22 August national holiday.
According to Earth's broadcasting company, Fiji's government confirmed the matter after the championship was resolved.
The day off, they'll take the team home the next day.
There are also festives for the heroic team in their own country.
Fiji's rugby team is celebrating the championship.
The Guardian says that the country was followed by a finalist in the capital of Suvala, where the stadium had been set up by a screen.
Normally, only the naive Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game joined our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage, told the Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru Guardian.
The drama in Rio - the Finnish woman passed out after her wild performance
In his last attempt, Milan Tokola succeeded 175 pounds after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life - threatening character as a lifter.
During or immediately after the heavy lifts, he's passed out many times.
No one's really been able to say why.
Tokola gained 175 kilos and 145 kilos of labor in Rio.
He was a total of 320 kilos.
Tokola was trying to get her job killed at her last 75 pounds, as did the other one.
In the third attempt, the weights rose as a result of a wild screaming.
The crown would shake under the weights until the judge accepted the raise.
The joy of the Finnish employer is that he has suffered from knee problems.
ROPS has acquired a Estonian employee Prosan - Veikkausli - Ilta-Santam
The Rovaniemi Ballo Society of Men's Football League has reached the end of the season with the Estonian player Albert Prosa.
We are looking for the top player of our team with power and the threshold for Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through a lot of 50 players from all over the world with more than ten players.
As a good alternative, Prosa, coach Juha Malinen, began to separate from the small hive.
Prosa, 25, comes to RoPS from the Tallinna Flora, where he made 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played for Estonia's country team.
Prosan is due to be with RoPS on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemis meet the master SJK of Finland.
RoPS became a need for a new attacker when last season’s secular king Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family star will once again come true: teen star shorts will reveal almost everything
As a nice Alex Dunphyna, the modern family comedy series, Ariel Winter, once again shatters by presenting his proud body.
Winter was shot in Hollywood this week in minishorts that don't leave much to imagination.
The shorts exposed not only the actor's legs but also this behind.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making its style and behavior much more courageous.
The star has been posted in images published in social media in extremely few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressed in very few costumes.
Winter, at the threshold of eternity, has recently published several images of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it from here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected Winter's having a "typical Hollywood transformation" child star as an adult.
He has been on television almost all his life and has grown during the Kardashians ’ era.
He has learned that the more it appears to reveal the surface, the more publicity and attention it receives in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family Series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has been heartbroken by some of his long-term fans with their image changes.
It's not hard to guess where he is in ten years' time, when the lower end is so hard now, says a woman in Winter Instagram.
Some of the female fans, however, are defending the actor and are urged to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what everyone else says.
You're inspired by many women, by a young woman.
The Japanese prefer from the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists to be lured with a tear: In autumn, it is possible to see a randommirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to begin the retreat trips from the start, Visit Finland reports in the newsletter.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations for the Japanese return tour.
Revon fires are our winter travel maps, and they are strongly connected to the heart winters and snowy landscapes.
There is a lot of demand for the children's winter renovation in winter, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
It is rare to know that the tear season begins from the early autumn and continues far into the spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the fires from the vision made by two times by chance, says the press release Visit Finland, see marketing manager Anne Lind.
Visits Finland's main focus group is wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and its design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising.
According to a survey carried out by researchers from Aalto University as well as from Turku and Tokyo universities, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like a clearer unique view of Finland, and according to Lind, this revolution has enormous potential.
Nights spent by Japanese tourists have grown much more in Finland than other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than doubled in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are of interest to Finland as a target group for tourism as they spent over EUR 80 million in Finland.
Average Japanese people spent 183 euros in Finland a day, Lind says.
Britain had to be satisfied with the silver rugby-7 race when Fidz's team won gold
The impressive success of the seven players in the Rugby tournament in Britain was crushed when Fidzi won it on Thursday at Rio's Deodoro stadium in the finals, and reached the 43-7.
Fidzi gave master's teaching in the ball handling, in the transfer, in the tributary, in the support game, in the run-ins and in the raa, and thus won gold — if there was the first Olympic medal in its entire history.
The killing meant silver, which was a little larger than that for Britain, for it was the third day of the country's silver. They can be proud of their success in the Rugby-7 tournament of the Olympics for the first time, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In the 7-5 semi-finals of South Africa, the firm victory of Bokse was likely to have a negative impact on the team on the finals on the same day.
Despite this, the Fidz team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-person team had been in full power.
The fact that at least one Britishman gets his neck tomorrow is Ben Ryan, head coach of Fidz, who is from Wimbledon, who is a former coach for the Rugby-7 team in England.
It's been quite an experience for Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games at Ryan's training in Adelaide Sevens.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
The kill is painful, but progress is shocking.
Fidzi began excellently and presented his tacking skills to Britain as a pleasure.
It seemed as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had run into a bunch of mobile buses, and world champions went up to 5-0 in lead, when Osea Kolinisau made a rush into the corner.
When the clock was four minutes, Jerry Tuwai made the second goal of the right-hand paint kick.
The situation between 12 and 0 and Britain had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell's wonderful guarantee prevented Leone Nakarawa from making a third goal, but it did not for long slow down Fidz's expenditure.
When the game had been played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored the right angle, after which the UK had lost between 17 and 0.
Nakarawa made the second goal of the further launch, when the first half-time was still more than one minute.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou ran through the British team's even more powerless bars and ran over the goal line.
After the hit, the opening period ended between 29 and 0.
It seemed that the Fidzians were born to play seven players in rugby, while the British were still in the role of the learner.
That's a lot to be said.
The United Kingdom made large-scale changes in half-time and managed to hold the Fidzians for four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half of the time until Joua Tuisova scored thanks to the excellent team of the Fidzians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation between 36 and 7 by putting a paint on the left corner of Britain, but the game had long since been lost to the islands of the South Sea, whose fans sang, swept flags and danced.
It was difficult not to admire Fidz’s purely detestable attitude.
Matta Viliaame finished the fishing for the Fidzilian cake by making a goal in the last few moments.
The Pill rang, the Fidzians embraced each other, and the British fell down on the field, completely crushed.
In the past days, Fidzi had won the Japanese semifinals by 20 to 5, and Britain had been stunned by South Africa in a tight semifinal where the UK's goal was solved.
Kyle Brown took the South African Boks to lead in the first half of the time, but Dan Norton crossed the goalline with his glamorous footwork and ran under the goal poles in the second half of the time.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of Anthony Watson of the 15 players in England’s rugby team, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
The battle of the coach against cancer encouraged Helen Glofer and Heather Stanning to row gold
This is more emotional than gold could be in these races.
From the first bet the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning swept 220 winning bets into history and found their extra purpose for the golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were in the valleys, the voice of coach Robin Williams, as a third coach in the boat, was encouraged by them to another successive Olympic pair of women, making them the first women in the history of British sport, which is the result of such achievement.
Their power was undisputed, the victory for them was already thirty - nine consecutive times, and once again a record.
What we see is not entirely in line with the nature of success.
There are a large number of helpful hands behind each row, each of which has contributed to the twin towards achievements. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who did not know if he would see this day.
Williams said the situation was tight at that time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor was able to cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
and the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes the way of thought."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The triangle was fortunate that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the season of the species at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little trouble as possible if, under such circumstances, he could even say so.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It acted as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the ward six and a half feet, at a time when they said that a few steps would be enough.
That's where it starts.
The rowing itself is a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the two thoughts were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and spoke a little more normal in trying to overcome his own restlessness.
Captain Stanning of the British royal artillery, who had a tour of Afghanistan, says: "Accessary level I have been ruining this week, which may be a little extreme, but that means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we've worked with Helen and Robin.
The last three years of Helen and Robin's check have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't have anything, so incredibly big thanks to her, she's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The twin has found an overwhelming rhythm to which their competitors have failed to compare.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the twins in New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had additional resources.
"We were very busy in a moment.
Helen's hockey "Pysy with you, stay with me."
It's very important that you don't get off the road."
"We were happy to go well, and at the same time we did not seek to do anything wonderful.
We didn't pursue heaven today, we just wanted to do a good race and win the race we did."
The twin will think about a year before deciding about his future.
Glover will celebrate next month with Steve Backshall, who is familiar with television nature programmes.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last competition.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"After London, it took about six months before I realized I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes to understand.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland Changes the Board of Panama Mountains
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which the protestors of Panama's data leaks have already called for in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed tax evasions of several Icelandic politicians through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the protestors.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the recent rage of the people affects the autumn election result.
In the June presidential elections, criticism of those taking power was clearly seen, and Mr Johannesson, who was outside of politics, was elected President.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isisi.
President of the US Republic Donald Trump withdrew his latest speeches.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organisation Isisi and the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to be involved in the establishment of an organisation.
The Democratic Party was upset by the speeches and called for an apology from Trump.
The military chief should never let anyone fall down like that, Clinton.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a burkini bathing suit, which is popular for Muslims on the bathing beaches, says, among other things, British magazine Guardian.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnar, states that going to shores and swimming is prohibited for everyone who does not have a good way and a self-respectable bathing suit.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which greatly indicate religious ties, can increase the risk of order disturbances in France, which has been targeted by terrorist attacks.
In mid - July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31 - year - old man drove to a crowd celebrating French National Day.
At the end of July, two men connected to Isis attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of bathing waters in Oulu area passed through the Seula - Pyykösjärvi with blue seams
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only Blue opacities have been observed on the Pyyyköskärvi bathing area.
During Tuesdays and Wednesdays, environmental activities in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU shores and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu region.
Apart from the coast of Meriniemi, the levels of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in bathing waters in all bathing areas below the limits of the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
Water levels of E.coli and enterococc were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operational limits.
The blue slurry found on the shores of Lake Lake Island does not yet make the water inability to swim, but, under favourable circumstances, the situation may quickly turn into a blue - green kelp.
Environmental action follows the situation with more intensive controls.

MTK Hakkarainen on forest gifts reduction: More than 80% of forest owners outside
A forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction that would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generation exchange of forest holdings.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal for forest gifts has four objectives: promoting generational changes in forest farms, promoting the age structure of forest owners, increasing the size of forest farms and increasing the supply of wood.
The objective of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would make a reduction in the pure income of the forest economy.
Above all, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generation of forest farms is good, commenting on the forestry producers of the Central Union (MTK) Director Juha Hakkarainen.
However, it is difficult to find a critical proposal for tax change.
A reduction in forest gifts is proposed as a function of the pure income of the forest owner.
It is a capital income that has been deducted from all other reductions.
In the opinion of the MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if a reduction could be made directly from the result of the sale of wood.
The proposal of the VM leaves the way in which a reduction of the pure income from the forest economy prevents the loss of the capital income of the forest, which should be reduced in other taxes.
Such a person would benefit from a tax advantage even if he did not want to sell.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to visualize it, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, the model applies only to a small part of forest owners.
The limit on the tax reduction committed to forest return is EUR 40,000.
It's drawn to the Hakkarainen's mind. It's too high.
As such, he said that 82 percent of Finnish forest owners would be cut off.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest heritage, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of farming.
In forest policy, a reduction in forest gifts has been taken according to Hakkarainen for decades.
It is based on the ageing of forest owners.
According to the MTC, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are retired.
A powerful racoon surprised the drivers in Himanga - two cars stuck in a stream and ran into each other.
In the Kalajoki Himanga there was a special turn on Friday morning.
According to the rescue facility, two consecutive times of the car went down into a stream after which the fire came after the driver ahead.
According to the sleeper's firemaster Harri Pyyhtis, he is suspected to have been a result of a powerful stroke.
There were two people in the back of the car who were both transported to the hospital to the hospital.
There's no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver of the earlier car was not injured.
The accident occurred on the highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometers to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings of Professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group show that the hardness of cancer tumor increases cancer’s evil quality.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow in a normal way in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the cancer surrounding tissue to match normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer medications may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue, in addition to cancer cells.
On 4 August, the results were published in a highly respected Nature Communications magazine in the field of cell biology.
The victim's death continues in court, and the prosecution also demands a murder sentence for another person.
The suit of the family home death of the musks continues in the court for both convicted.
Two young men were convicted of the death of a family home in Muhoks in June.
One received 8 years for 4 months, among other things, of killing young people and serious robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and serious robbery as a young person.
A convicted person was also sentenced to serious road safety threats as a young person and to carry a vehicle as a young person.
The judgment of the Court of Justice was appealed to by the prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who received a more severe judgment.
The prosecutor demands that the man who has been punished be convicted of murder as a young person for 12 years in prison.
They were at the moment of action in full understanding.
According to the Court of Justice, the 17-year-old youngsters killed the schoolhouse as head of the child protection unit working in July last year.
The 17-year-old who received the hit was indicted by the conviction that he was behind the pilot sitting on the couch of the living room.
The director had been able to get rid of him and put him in his young room, and one of the young hit him with a vacuum pipe.
Among other things, the controller was strangled with a wire, hit and kicked in the head.
According to the demonstration, both convicted men were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape family homes at least since the day before.
Ice shark is the most long-lasting spine in the world, growing only at 156 years old.
The world’s longest live vertebrate is confirmed by the ice shark, reports the research published in the Science magazine.
In the northern parts of the Atlantic, like icefish floating around Greenland, a hoker can live up to 400 years old.
She's only growing when she's 156.
The ice age adds that it will grow only in a centimeters a year.
Only one species of bivalve molluscs is known to be longer than live ice sharks.
Researchers found the age with a radio carbon boost.
Because of the nuclear experiments in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on that, researchers were able to assess the age of sharks.
For old age, it was estimated that 392 years - yes, a throw in the direction or another could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic wiser - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need any more of the world.
Even one third of all tax revenues from the State would be missed if the change in company tax was implemented by Donald Trump.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular with tax incentives that benefit most.
Trump described his tax programme as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
Corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without collecting it, it would be a huge amount of $1,000 billion a year.
The upper income tax rate is now 39,6, after the cut by Trump 33.
They'd give up all the inheritance tax.
Trump accused the State of over-regulation in business and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental standards which have been decided on by the emergency installations must be re-established and the energy regulation must be broken down.
The healthcare reform of Barack Obama must be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed as "experts rather than bureaucrats".
According to Trump, "the harmful" trade policy is the main cause of the problems facing the United States.
Free trade agreements would be called off.
45% of imports from China and 35% of Mexico would be subject to a penalty tax.
We'll offer you a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our confession, Trump declared it.
Donald Trump America doesn't have to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American aircraft to unite cities, American ships to control the sea, American steel to lift up new skyscrapers throughout the country.
By way of fact, Trump faithfully read the words written by the assistants, even though well - organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump's program taking the United States to a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton released his own program early on Friday in Finland.
An attack on the past - People's News
The sea is fatally mallling, but the actual attack wave is hitting in the middle of Madrid's street villa - whether an account can start with the past.
It summed up Pedro Almodvar's novelty story.
Almodovar's previous directional work Travel growers (2013) was a small hair and ronzkiny satiric comedy, a premier skin where I live (2011) the peaks of the career of the Spanish situr.
Julieta (2016) is placed somewhere between those two works.
It's a kind of internal love, a human relationship and a family drama with a mother-and-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and we'll see a lot of it as a long way back.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged denominator (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the after-stampings of random encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be wondrousally all the way to the finals of the film.
In the form of a back and long letter, Juliet's life course for her grown-up daughter.
He starts from the time before the daughter was born, from the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta's young teacher Adraina Ugarte, a TV-based series between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Juliet's ageing has been treated in a way that can be considered a cook, but I'd say it's a strange and literal wipe.
For Almodóvar films, there is often a fair distance in Julieta to such a characteristic humorousness.
It is a well-informed, controlled, location in places of good music, and quite sad film with the elements of eleggy.
Instead, the visual color beauty typical of the Spanish director is recorded and is beginning to inject small silence into the eye as a pure design rather than an effective dramatic mechanism.
Diseases, deaths or only sudden loss of life, but the surface remains as Korean.
This applies in particular to clothing: in the case of a nominal person, you change from scene to scene, and the same applies to the visible ears.
Almodóvar is very specific in these matters, but the main point is that the premises of the current scene are not particularly improved.
Mechanically, once again, the effect is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript on the basis of three novels of Alice Munron, a Canadian, awarded in Nobel 2013.
Novellit is published in the book Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly flattered written literary filming.
Materials would have been emotionally superiorly more dramatic to drama, to the extent that big things - especially pale guilt - are dealt with by the ethics of the movie.
Control and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
In capitals: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of the film is 12.8.
The government's trying to play the election game - People's News
No new cuts will be made, hot ministers, so that the basic Finns do not collapse completely.
However, the cutbacks decided in the spring will be made by rappers.
There will be no new surgery.
Four billion savings have already been decided.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister of Finance Petrer Orpo (kok).
It is true that there are no new cuts in the proposal of the VM, since the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring frame bed.
Children's pension, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training operations continue.
Kuntales haunting
Why do ministers so hard to stress that there will be no new cuts on them?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipalities will be held in April and they will be the main heat meter of the parliamentary term, not the gallup.
In the past, it has been seen that the performance of the government's performance, which takes the different directions of the government parties, is ruining the government's mood for a long time.
However, the Gallupi reports that the Government's main Finns are waiting to be killed, although the result of the previous elections was only 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, Finnishs received 752 new delegates, most of which will be realised next spring at the price of influence in the judiciary.
The life line of the government of the three equal parties is in the hands of the basic Finns.
Now it has not endured, but more than half of the voters had the need for government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visits have also come to the surface.
The fact that new surgery will not come with the rhetorics will be clouded by the fact that next year they will be brutally made and, secondly, they will try to soften the expected attack on the basic Finns.
Large surgery in 2018?
In a year's time, it'll probably be different if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set a target for the fight against debt in this parliamentary term, but the Petter Orpo budget proposal will be spent next year at EUR 5.9 billion, which is more than this year.
After royal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and to admit that the government is not able to follow its own programme: debt is not overpowered or even slowed.
The second one is to stick to the program.
This means even more severe cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would at least be renegotiated close to the balance during 2018, and then in spring, the parliamentary elections will be held against what will come.
The debt-to-equity of these activities is not a good thing.
It is quite clear that the current measures do not lead to debt, even though Juha Sipil is trying to make a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäen at the Committee on Budgets are unresponsibly proving:
The world economy's growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. there will be no veto aid from the international economy.
After the collapse in 2008, Finland's national economy has not just risen, except during the recovery policy at the beginning of the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent in this decade and has increased on average from 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
In 2014, the current general government debt, which exceeded the 60 % limit, will rise to 70% in mid-2014.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the left-wing union was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment costs about EUR 6 billion, which is practically fully covered by the new debt.
This is the central, assembly and basic Finnish concept of what is responsible.
Question: A lot of work is being done for the municipality.
Three out of four consider the organisation of day care, youth work and exercise for children to be the responsibility of the municipality, the KAKS - The study of the Finnish Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Area.
A clear majority of the people are also responsible for libraries, culture, civil education, construction supervision, upper secondary education and waste management.
In turn, the responsibility of the county is more determined by the rural development scheme, special care, vocational training, vocational higher education and institution care for people with developmental disabilities.
None of the local authorities' duties are to be transferred to the State.
A minor race ran back and forth to the end of the driveway, running away from the police.
The 16-year-old motor biker in Joensuu drove the police department away at the Ilomantstiant on Friday night at half the same time.
The police force tried to stop without lights driving the motorcycle, but the young man went driving the police to run away from a fair speed.
The back track continued on the Sokajan coast, from which to the Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle was driven out of the road.
After that, the young man ran away, but the faster the police ran into the fugitive.
The flight test for the driver showed 0.75 prommel.
And he didn't have a driver's license that would have given him the right to drive a motorcycle.
The case is examined, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck that was in the stone truck fell down in the ditch.
The truck in the coal truck fell down on the lake Polvijärvi on Thursday night at 21.15 p.m.
The truck was driven to the left in a turnway and fell out of the way and fell on its side.
The rescue facility lifted the injured driver through the door above the fallen truck, along with the rescue helicopter staff and first guards.
The lifting of the vehicle remained the responsibility of the car's owner.
From a fallen truck, hydraulic oil was poured into the road, which was absorbed by the rescue plant.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The old lady disappeared in the afternoon on the Air River
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since afternoon in the Gulf of Lahtinkyla, South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for about 165 centimeters long, careful, and good-looking women with white hair under their chin.
The findings and indications of lost movements are requested to call the tip number of the North Pole's situation centre 0295440513.
The materials of the great accident in the air - see the photo gallery of the Paraphess' destruction
The feuds of Parafest festival tents, which fell through the blast flow, caused massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafestystystitus, estimates that the festival will be able to get to its feet economically, and the event can also be organised next year.
The last performer of Parafess was Kalle Salonen at the end of Friday night on the tulip.
The program will continue on Saturday at 13 a.m. on the premises of the city theatre.
The art center in Ahjo is the Parafest exhibition from 13 am to 15.
The programme will be organised in a planned way.
The flow rate is generated in the thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a fall in the air flow.
Changes in the state of the deep cloud of water bind heat and, therefore, the falling air cools and speeds towards the earth are accelerated.
An air science institution reports that there are several flood flows in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the way in which the flow rate is due.
The drop-off was hit by the Parafest event on the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum Friday afternoon before 5:00.
Three tents fell into reverse, there were about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people were mildly offended.
There was one child in the group who was slightly injured to follow-up treatment.
Air pollution ageing London
According to the study, London's skin is getting older faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
It's about the British research, according to Eventing Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that two and a half years of London’s skin is two and a half years older than the age partner living in rural areas.
The skin-solding small particles are a very fine dusty pollution, which is the source of transport fuel.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Eventing Standard, are nearly 9,500 lontos each year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to pass the outer layer of the skin.
In the Cac study it was found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those in London who walk their way in the vicinity of the congested streets.
People in London can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, in different masks, but it is recommended that regular skin cleansing be given a more practical solution.
Tractor's brakes betrayed a man standing in front of you.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got off the tractor and went to visit it in front, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor fell on the man.
The man did not remain under it, but the tractor, however, got to the point where he was transported to the Central Hospital for further investigations, seriously injured.
The tractor didn't make it any further, for it ran into stones in front of him.
Rising With New Power for the Future Year
At the volleyball Master League, a riverman Liiga-Riento leaves a series of better starting points in October than a man's memory.
The team's been in a team for three weeks now.
There is more certainty in the common cell than in the previous periods, when the series’s bottoms have been darker for Rienno.
Jani Säis, who continues as head coach of the race, greets the new team as an attemptr and uniform.
From a foreign triangle, a middle stormer, Fred Muson, will begin his second season in Rieden.
The new faces are 23 years old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who's been in Rwanda's country team, is a 20-cent hacker.
Garchet is, accordingly, a passer, a Brazilian with a measure of 198 cents.
Through Josban, Kataja and Jokipoik, to the U.S. Land Force
Anne Jpartnernen has played in almost all of the Salibandy's World Championships since 2003.
Now there are six races going on in Tampere, only 2013 after Canada was better off in North America's Karsins.
I was working in Turku and playing with those women when I noticed the announcement.

In 1967, he was born near the city of Elizabeth, New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987, Jpartnernen was able to study data processing at the University of Joensuu.
When I came to Joensuu, the species was not yet played at the MS level as salibandy.
It was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja, and later in Jokipoj, hockey in the SM series, Jpartnerne remembers.
At the university, the Salibandy SM series was played in 1991-92, and the following three went through Josba.

Beach Volley Artist Essi Hasun's circle closes to Kouvola - SM gold missing from the prize box
Essi Hassu is about to quit as a Beach Volley player at least after the temporary season.
The Finnish championships of the Beach voyeur will be settled during the weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, the medals are played in the series of adults and young people.

I'm sure it's gonna be a great arena for the pessis stadium.
I haven't played in the adults' series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu tunnel.
The Kouvola district set off Hasu's spark for sports and gave good luck for a wonderful hobby.
There's a lot of memories about childhood.
When I was nine years old, I started the volleyball at Elimäen NMKY's E-girls.
The main is the mind too big to play shirt, the knee shields that spin on the ankles, and the huge midgets and choreographs after the points, Hasu recalls.
In small areas, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The spirit of the group created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were heavily involved in the teammate's father trained us and our mother was the chairman of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasulle Beach Volley was already a natural species choice for the counterweight of indoor balloon.
The beach on the riverside has already played a song since the 1990s.

Solomon Koli was bravely going to be a farmer.
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means risk-taking, sweat and energy.
Young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural farmer because he believes in a positive future also in the countryside.
Koli started working with his little brother Valteri Koli about two years ago as a successor to their home condition.
Their father Markus Koli helps and counsels brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a farmer meant taking debt and increasing the order so that bread could come into hand with agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been a pleasure at the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If there's anything to start, I think it's gotta be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went to build a hot tub, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
However, I myself came to the project with great courage, and I have been fully involved in it, says Solomon Koli, and adds that he would not have done it if he had no faith in producing pure Finnish food and in making it all right.
The aim of Solomon Kol’s car - growing car is to invest even more in his bigger nave.
The work has yielded results, for Solomon Koli has been selected for the 10 best groups in the competition of the young food producer in the Future of Rural Region magazine.
At best, he competes for a possible win.
He's allowed to vote on the magazine's website until 21.8.
Bulgaria first reports inflation for eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation was 1% in July.
This is the highest value for several years (after June 2012) and for the first time when it rises to more than zero after October of last year, when the country reported a positive inflation rate of 0.2%.
The average annual inflation in the last 12 months (from August 2015 to July 2016) measured by CPI compared to the previous 12 months (from August 2014 to July 2015) was - 0.8 %.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The percentage of inflation since the beginning of the year (per cent from July 2016 to December 2015) has been -0.2 per cent, and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2 per cent compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, increases in consumption groups in July 2016 were observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport equipment (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2 %), furniture, household appliances and fixed-term care (0.5 %) and health (0.1%).
The prices of the following product groups remained at the same level as the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, dwellings, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and training.
Snapchat's anime efficiency is criticised asian caricature
Snapchat says that the filter was inspired by an anime, but some observers think it's racist.
With Snapchat's lens tool some 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into ananaks, dogs or characters in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lens are unbaked, feature-depleting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfieties per day.
All the delusions quickly come to public knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have received a review of where it has been accused of promoting blackface honey or bleached skin bags as a beauty idea.
So when it offered to some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into vipers, wrongly teethed and made the cheeky bulls, some of the critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yeellowface").
The critics also wondered whether these repeated contradictions were referring to the greater problem that the company had with diversity.
The news and rage spread over the wide Wednesday and wrote e-mails The Verge and Motherboard day after Snapchat told me he removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended to be a tribute to anime characters, not to be a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some were very hard to deny anime comparison.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparani, whose receipts were widely distributed, said in his e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and awkward".
He adds: "It’s hard to deny the very unflavoured association of Asian caricature with filter efficiency.
It shows that the filter isn't just "heellowface", it's something that's been taken to a degenerate extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
The American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
The general audience of Snapchat is composed of young people who are ethnically more than their parents' worth. This may mean that they are likely to expect discretion even more.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates a picture that offends the user, these types of things are no longer too easily ignored, as they used to be," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu interview on Thursday.
As the Product Manager and designer, Zhu decided on Thursday to remove Snapchat's account and encouraged others to do the same.
In his article and a telephone interview in the media, he said that he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation of diversity in Snapchat’s recruitment practices.
Zhu criticises the company's majority of White and Only Men's Directors and decided with the Hastag he wrote: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either so that their one-sided staff does not have colored people, so they can make decisions like this, or they can also have colored workers, but their position is not such that they dare to express their views directly and easily" says the Chinese American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely refused to reply.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, calling for its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of his staff, but according to his report, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on the under-represented human groups and the promotion of participation within the company.
For their part, Zhu says that he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
According to the Congress expert group, military officials distorted the intelligence on Isis.
On Thursday, the Congress Expert Group published a report saying that officials from the US armed forces, Central Command, changed intelligence reports so that they would give an optimistic picture of war against Iss in Iraq and Syria than what was happening on the field.
According to the analyses, the Republican presidents of the Committee of the United States of America on Intelligence and Defence Resources set up a working group to report the 'general dissatisfaction' of the armed intelligence analysts.
Central Command, briefly Centcom, is the United States military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The polls accepted by the senior leaders of Centcom gave a more positive picture of the US anti-terrorist activities than the facts on the field showed, and were, without exception, more positive than in the analysis of other entities in the intelligence community," reports the press release on the report.
"Centcom events cannot be accepted – our soldiers suffer when the high-level political decision-makers are presented with false analyses," says California Republican MP Ken Calvert.
"Centcom's flaws extend to the top level of the organization."
The 10-page report details in detail the ongoing problems identified in 2014 and 2015 by the Central Command's descriptions and analyses of American activities to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that the reports ordered by Obama's administrative authorities were flawed, it gives an analytical picture of the fact that Centcom's leaders would have forced them to make a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isisi.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, statements and statements given to Congress by the Central Command were significantly more positive than the events actually were," says the report.
"For the first time, the official of Centcom gave a public statement that a large military assault on Mosul could take place in April or May 2015."
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of Isisi.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says the Republican representative of Kansas, Mike Pompeo, in a press release.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior U.S. military intelligence officers manipulated the intelligence received to reduce the threat of Isisi in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a working group when they learned of the doubts expressed by the analysts that information on Isis would have been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday follows more detailed results as studies continue.
In addition, the Ministry of Defence's supervisor has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence data.
On Thursday, the democratic members of the House of Representatives of the House of Representatives published their own results, which were partly consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"Centcom created an over-limited process between 2014 and 2015, to assess intelligence on the security forces of Issia and Iraq," says Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's high-level democratic representative.
According to Schiff, this process "supervised the publication of intelligence results, "supervised the morals of analysts" and "supervised insufficiently different views".
However, according to Schiff and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House would have tried to pressure Centcom's analysts to adapt their conclusions to the "premised or political official line".
On Tuesday, the news site Daily Beast reported the preliminary results of the Congress investigation.
Last August, the New York Times told me about the Pentagon Oversight Inspector's investigation, which began as a result of claims made by Centcom's analysts.
The Pentagon informant, Lieutenant General Patrick Evans, reports that the Ministry of Defence does not comment on Congress report as long as an inspector's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says: "At times, scientists disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation also has other consequences, apart from trying to find out whether the United States' leading bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (one of the many defence claims made by the defence authority).
However, the arguments made last year may have questioned how much President Obama can rely on Central Command and the fact that it provides honest estimates of the military operation of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of human intelligence is in line with the differences that occurred over a decade ago when the Centcom Intelligence Officer Gregory Hooker published a study saying that, despite protests by President George W. Bush, despite many analysts, only small troops were in favour of Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would happen to the invasion of 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion on Isis intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year, Hooker’s working group concluded that despite the opposite public statements, air strikes in Isisi’s managed refineries had not significantly undermined the terrorist group’s economy because it had built temporary refineries and could thus sell oil in the dark market.
However, the results of the study were not transmitted outside Central Command, reports The Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was the target of criticism last year after many legislators had assessed the statements of witness given to the Senate as being too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April, and in his place as Commander of Central Command, General Joseph L. Votel rose.
The United States will win the fourth duel in women's mahockey and establish its position in the interim review with Britain
After making three goals in victory, in a 6-1 game against Japan Katie Bam made the first two goals for the US women's mahockey country team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but the 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had before succeeded in the same way.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I'm not one of those people who like to read about their paintings."
However, he knows this: the Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games and share in their group first place with Britain, which continued to win on Thursday, between 2 and 0 in Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States play opposite Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Each team survived the final match, which will determine which of them will be the first and the second of the six teams.
The first is to avoid a longer time encounter with a hard Dutch team, who won the second reading.
Despite how Saturday’s game takes place, the Americans have already brought up their surprising success in these races for four years since it remained the last 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on the team in London too.
He grew up in Blue Bell in Pennsylvania, and he first caught his country hockey country when he was 3 years old (his parents played a double sister in Drexel). He got to the country team when he was 16.
The Olympics in 2008 missed him when he couldn't make it to the final player list.
Then came the 2012 competitions, where he and his team were not just seen successful.
In the following year, the coach was appointed the English Craig Parnham, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, spiritual and physical," says Bam.
"Our work in London wasn't what it is now.
We've made a full translation."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the finish line during the first half of the time, hitting the ball close to the box.
India had entered the game without any tournament gains, but it proved to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained the 1-0 situation until the third episode, when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball long along the left side of the field, climbed to the middle floor, hit the ball goal, and brought the Americans to 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the last goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The game was the first tournament in which the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games the American goal had been sunk in each of them.
Briggs is now living up to his success,
Same as Bam.
"Our position is good now," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the results of the Saturday game.
In the middle of Olympiahulina, trampoline brings zen
Regardless of the location and time, the Olympics are bound to come to an end.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to be the next intense message constantly and everywhere.
Like the Olympic fire itself, it would be a burning message capsule that moves from bower to swimmer, swimmer to gymnast and gymnast to triathlonist.
You can't open television, read newspapers, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the cafe queue without ever hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The Olympics' first-time Dooley charm smiled and might well have a name on everyone's lips, which would appear and be part of the best viewing and listening time, would be the sponsors' favorite and perform a good mind in TV movies if he were just a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordmaker.
But Dooley, 28 from the California Lake Forest, competes with the Olympic Games trampoliin.
The Olympic fire is not lighting in equal terms all competitions.
Far from the middle, partially in the shadow are less well known sports species, such as the air-stamp, spring-stamp, feather-ball and taekwondo.
We'll always have a bra, and we'll have a championship for a long time.
But if I'm allowed to write a minor piece of my own special favor, I'd like to draw attention to the mutilated charm of trampolin.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic species since 2000 Sydney, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so limited that many of the people I interviewed did not even know it was the Olympic species.
Ignorance can be regional.
Although the United States has participated in the Olympictrample, the country has never reached the medals and has not moved to the finals before 2012.
Men’s trampoliin medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and women’s side of the medals are the pale Canadians.
China Dong Dong and Canada Rosie MacLanna defend this year's gold medals they won in London.
Trampoliin, however, has the charm of the underdog, partly because of the impenetrable ear, it sounds more suitable for circus school than the Olympic Games.
(In this context, I recognise that I am not an expert, only a ordinary fan.)
There is a gathering of its potential, which has been used in the drawings in the endless, percussion of characters, but it also has the same value as in the gymnasty and swimming jump, i.e. in the species that are inherently united in the trampolihin.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "ponyboard".
Honorable masters jump on a huge trample that seals them to almost 10 metres high. Before landing, jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements, such as tours, skills and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, jumps are assessed on the basis of performance, difficulty and flight time.
32 athletes from 17 different countries are competing in Rio for the championship of the trampoline team, 16 men and 16 women.
The direction of the most common Olympic species is directly ahead.
The mitalit mines must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes beyond the goal line, at times around the field.
In addition to the paint line or the departure wall, they also have another objective they are aiming at in TV-based reports, namely the World or Olympics.
This determined pursuit is generous, admirable, even fanatical — and even sufficient to get a viewer on tears.
But this is something I consider to be a bit exhausting only in the eyes of the races.
This is where the trampoline offers a resting breath.
There's a way up in Trampoli.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast pulls up without weight like an astronaut, falls down, and sneezes back up.
Of course, there is also a competition aspect, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve an intense rush into the finish and jump far away, only a sleepy and melting combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to the Zen as it can be to the Olympics.
Women's cartitting games and finals will take place on Friday afternoon and will start at 13.00 local time and the corresponding races will take place on Saturday at the same time.
NBC sends the finals as part of its afternoon delivery, which begins at 14.00 local time on the day of each visit.
In the midst of the Olympic Man, there is a peaceful and wonderful moment that might not be noticed in the midst of the general hunya.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering attractive male athletes and performing them – as the US men in Wall Street Journal recently proposed – then Logan Dooley is only waiting for his negligent new fan.
A whole generation protested in Ethiopia, a long - term ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently broken down demonstrations requiring political change throughout Ethiopia.
According to the audiences, several protestors have been shot to death at meetings with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
For the last decade it has been one of the most stable African countries and a reliable Western ally whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaking anti-governmental demonstrations that are spreading to more and more large regions.
Just last week, thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was unsatisfied.
According to witnesses, the police shot and killed several non-armed protestors.
Presumably, the video of demonstrations at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year shows how security forces beat young people who have been forced to stand against the wall.
The leading UN human rights officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"A united view of the country has always been difficult and it is even more difficult to move forward," says Rashid Abdi, Research Director of the International Crisis Group for Africa.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, whose stability has been promoted by the Western countries.
The U.S. Army and intelligence support the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia. Only few African countries, if nothing, will get this much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has improved radically; the capital of Addis Ababa is even a new roadside.
The streets of cities are usually calm, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from the model country of democracy, and human rights organisations have been constantly reporting government repression policy, the opposition country is very limited and the dissidents are quickly suppressed.
Many people have been deported from the land, imprisoned, killed or driven far away from the wilderness.
But the situation may change.
"If the people are blocked, and it has no alternative but to show its mind, it will come out," says Seyoum Teshome, who is working as a university journalist at Central Etopia.
"All the youth shows their mind.
A whole generation protests."
There are many issues of dissatisfaction, from land use to the curation of the government coalition.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last once opposition, as a result of which they now rule the whole Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing at the Eritrean border, where the frenzied situation required hundreds of deaths in the battle in June.
Analysts fear that more or less over the last few years, such as Oromo’s release line or Ogade’s People’s Freedom Front, may seek to make use of confusion and re-armage.
There are many reasons why the bitter mood under the surface is being broken down right now.
The first is obvious innocent: smartphones.
Only a few years ago, Ethiopians have been able to communicate in social media when the most affordable smartphones became more common and the availability of the Internet improved.
Even when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many are able to access the Internet through brokerage services that hide their location.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this was how they called people into demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest groups in Ethiopia, the Oroms and the Amhares.
Oroms and amharas are not natural allies.
The Amharas from Christendom, mostly the upper part of Ethiopia, have long ruled the politics and business of the country and removed the Oroms, most of which are Muslims and live in the suburbs.
But this, too, is changing.
"Cooperation is getting deeper and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Multu Gemechu, Director of Oromo.
The greatest demonstrations have just been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many Amharas and Oroms feel that Ethiopia is unfairly controlled by the Tigre tribe, representing only about six per cent of the population and, however, controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause behind restlessness is the death of Meles Zenawin.
Former rebel leader Meles was Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until he died of a nameless illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius that could see behind the corner.
Analysts showed that he was particularly capable of detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and of using ambassadors who agreed to the negatives of the opponents.
"The present government lacks this essential instinct," says the conflict officer Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemaram Desaleg, stepped into the boots of Meles, almost unknown.
Unlike Meles, from the Tigre region of North Ethiopia, the Hailemaram comes from the south.
According to the analyses, he has no trust in the security forces administered by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear this means more bloodshed.
On the previous occasion, similar riots were created in Ethiopia in 2005, when thousands showed their mind against the elections, which according to the analysts of the government were first fucked up and then stolen.
In post-election unrest, many protestors were killed, though less than in the previous months, and the unrest stopped relatively quickly.
The development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders in long-term infrastructure planning, such as the new roadside, and the significant progress made in combating poverty.
But the internal grudge toward the Ethiopian government has clearly not hindered power.
And the grudge is about to take a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, the Amhara city in Gondar, the protestors attacked the companies owned by the tigers, and the hate speech against the tigers is becoming more widespread in social media.
The analysis shows that protests put the United States and other Western allies in a situation of tobacco.
The United States Government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned, neighbouring airships in Somalia, but according to the United States, the base has recently been closed.
At the same time as the West wants to clearly support democracy, it does not want its ally in a previously unstable region to collapse.
"This takes a tight balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isisi
Donald J. Trump tried to pull his words back on Friday in his latest campaign, claiming that he was not really the "bases" of President Obama and Hillary Clinton this week.
This clarification raised new questions to the Republican people about the ability of the President's candidate to send a clear message to the citizens of his country.
His supporters, who have to try to defend their candidates in these stormy moments and explain comments that he may not have meant, will also be faced with a difficult situation.
Trump made a statement at the election session on Wednesday night and repeated at various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed to be President and Hillary Clinton to have created Isisi.
In the early morning, however, Trump quoted and said that he was being sarcasm.
Trump passed his full speech in the Twiit from the last day when I said that he had been charged with several of his accusations.
When the radio driver and the conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trumpic lighten his claim by saying that Obama was trying to destroy Isisi, the Republican presidential candidate did not consent to retreat from his claim.
The most recent crisis rose when Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy when the numbers of suffering fell.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy talks in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back on the subject again.
He warned Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and that Clinton's speech was boring.
Trump's been defending sarcasm before.
At the end of July he received extensive criticisms when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack into Hillary Clinton's e-mail. Later he explained his comments by saying, "I was, of course, sarcastic."
In this way Trump stretches the limits of the political speech and pulls his words back, if necessary.
"I believe that it is his way of testing certain messages, which respond to his supporters. He sees how the supporters react to messages, and "to clarify" in one way or another," says Communication Expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidents.
"But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are circumcised enough to cross different sides."
Rather than softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has in recent days even made his style more lenient when his support has continued to fall.
On Friday, a new opinion study conducted by NBC, Wall Street Journalal and Marist said that Trump's support was significantly lower in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while in Florida the situation is very flat.
While Trump usually tries to avoid asking for forgiveness of his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics that they misunderstand his words or do not understand his sense of humor.
But after becoming more and more specific, his presidential campaign in the last few months, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position in which they have to publicly defend Trump's comments, no matter how provosive.
One of Trump's most important supporters, Rudolph W. Giulian, former mayor of New York, was strongly defending the presidential candidate during the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I consider his words justified, as a political speech," answered Giuliai, when he was asked whether Trump was truthful when he claimed that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded Isisi.
"It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization which Obama called completely incorrectly "the team of the lowest series" and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most of the Republicans representing power are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Hillary Clinton was Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed Isisi to continue to act when it was determined not to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday's election events in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of perpetuating his speech and his discriminatory attitude to him.
He mocked "unsatisfied and pathetic" television Commissioners who try to find out about him, but he says that they can't do it.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation, and they just said it was more clear that he was not a president.
Due to an excessive rent increase, a coffee shop will open at Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a slightly explosive cafe in Williamsburg, where only cash was used and where there was no Wi-Fi, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe had to be priced out of its streetside location on Bedford Avenue, when the rent was disproportionate.
Verb Cafe replaced in summer 2014 by Soap Cherie sells soaps in the form of cakes.
The locals consider this to be a waste of the loss of a coffee shop under middle-classization.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is no longer in place, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even if New York is no longer the same, there's also a new one.
In November last, Verb Cafe opened a new cafe for Greenpoint, just a fair mile north of its original location.
The new Verb cafe has Wi-Fi and can pay with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unprepared.
Coffee is still good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb cafe is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Verb space bagels from the same supplier as before and use the same espressoconone model.
In addition, it even re-used old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says, however, that he wanted to try something new.
added new products to the list.
There are peken egg-sandwichees available, filled with capers and crushed onions.
There's also a list of dark-man's skins.
No more beers from coffee, but juices made from fresh fruit.
After having had a coffee shop for nine months, Rodriguez says that he has noticed that old standard customers started to visit Verb as a smooth flow.
"For example, many of our old customers had to be priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who visited the cafe recently on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After he moved to Greenpoint, he took a walk to Verbi, who was still in Williamsburg.
When Verb was shut down, he tells me he's stopped running coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he's drinking coffee again, even though on Sunday, instead of having his usual ice coffee, he took the chai procedure, which is also a list of news.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He used to go to the cafe before work, and he ordered the same thing without exception.
"I walked into the cafe at about seven o'clock a day, like a machine, and there they were already making my butterballs with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and bring new products to his menu.
Today, Rosenthal still has a standard product, but sometimes he varies from bacon, egg and cheese fillings to his bagels.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have a grudge for the soap store taking the old place.
The Soap Cherien owners even offered to make a special ticket for which Verb's own cold-cold coffee was used.
"We can still grab the offer," says Rodriguez.
Also, the Polish people who traditionally lived in Greenpoint have accepted the cafe with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu half, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is seeking a suitable place so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
A local juice company wants to bottle up and sell a coffee cold-frozen.
The coffee tree may also expand into the next building.
However, it is enough for many customers to get their old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the cafe was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like it was coming home, says Whitt.
"I got the smell of a coffee shop."
The hard food of the great season in the new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after his arrival as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office room in the White House.
President Roosevelt, who was known as the Golden Cross, was fond of the luxury food at Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the haypox pamper and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day, his menu was more modest: Devil’s eggs (deviled Eggs) in tomato sauce, potato eggs, and dessert from the bonemeal.
"It was an indication of culinary solidarity for people who suffer," says Jane Ziegelman.
His husband Andrew Coe adds: "It was also a message to the Americans about how they should eat."
A couple in Brooklyn Heights work as a food historian.
Coen's latest book, called Chop Suey, tells of the Chinese kitchen in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, called 97 Orchard, tells us through the story of the Lower East Side floor.
Their new joint work is published by Harper and published on Tuesday by A Square Meal, which describes the history of American food during the 1930s as a great recession.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when meeting with the supplier Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron cloudmaker and opened in the same year as the great stock collapse took place, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe for turkey, potato cheese and mixed coffee.
When the reporter ordered a meatloaf, the couple said it was suitable for a very large discussion about eating the season.
"The coins were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"The people ate peanut scraps, liver fractures, and paprika.
They were made of substances that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine eating so much peanuts that they're enough for the whole meal."
Andrew Coe's agitated.
"It must have been squeezed in the stomach like lead," he says.
Before large years of lay, the American table, especially in rural areas, worked on the Buffet principle "eat as much as you want".
Women made food for agricultural workers, and for breakfast, lunch, and dinner there were repatriated pies.
It was the Americans who sent food to those starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a crown of ways in which the people survived when the abundance suddenly had to be abandoned.
"This was the time when the food became a central and disturbing topic for the Americans" says Coe and explain why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Similarly, there was a new beneficial diet: Ziegelman says that valuable food types such as anxiety and pasta dishes became the main food, and pasta food was called "a powerful way to use the food stars", because cooks could cover up not so attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
The meat, which had been the main part of the American meal for years, became a sustainable luxury.
Strange blends were tried, the most important being the fulfillment of calorie and food values, and not even a taste or even a healthy kitchen sense.
In carrying out a study for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared the oven syrups filled with peanut butter used as porous food.
"It didn't get popularity at the dinner table," says Coe, where is it?
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
peanut butter and garlic are not compatible at all.
This was characteristic of many household reactions."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office for Households from 1923 to 1943, directed people's eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be precise budget holders and to meet the challenge of making delicious dishes like carrot-kermaspagett.
The Square Meal book is a celebration of historic flavors.
Particularly tasty are reports of government reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "you let me eat cake" position.
At the same time as he publicly praised his child’s simple food on the Iowan farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a sophisticated gentleman who had become.
"He liked the continental kitchen, like fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He almost ate in a gold-coated dining room with a tuxedo on his head.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to show an example on his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste, the dishes in the White House were not only the boring ones in Washington, but also the worst made."
Many of the land-time dishes were abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition continues to be reflected in how we pay attention to calories and nutrients and how science has been applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the couple say that they began to understand the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother, such as why he could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away," said Coe.
"The people even began to feel bad about his cooking," recalls Ziegelman.
For the first time in the wind.
After the main meals had been emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe raised their home-made bonnet food, the same thing President Roosevelt ate at his lunchtime.
"It's called a snowstorm," says Ziegelman, and adds that giving a visible name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There were no cream waxes, only bones, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We snuck up our spoon in a thick, brown field.
Well, I guess it didn't taste bad.
Coe danced for the second time and for the third time.
"The German nuts would do better than this," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget leader.
For Gilead, full compensation for legal fees for hepatitis C patentitis with Merck
The Court of Justice of the United States ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a full compensation for the fees incurred for the legal dispute with Merck & Co Inc concerning the patent of hepatitis C.
In June, Gilead was released from the damages of USD 200 million imposed on it by the violation of two patents owned by Merck in relation to success medicines named Gilead Sovaldi and Harvard.
In the judgment of Thursday, the Court of Justice of the United States of America, Beth Labson Freeman, says that Gilead was entitled to be exempt from the fees for the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which manages the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can treat a large 90% of hepatitis C.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck appealed to another court and called for the private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance in Gilead medicines.
The U.S. forces have taken over Manbij city from Isis.
The troops supported by the United States have taken over the city of Manjib, near the Turkish border, when the last extremismist Isisis left town, reports the newsman of the troops.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group now branched the city to find the last Isis fighters hidden in the city.
A representative of the Manbij Military Council of SDF, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages taken by Isis fighters have been released.
"The office is now fully in possession, but we're still carrying out search operations," said Darwish.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal tax.
On Friday 2015, the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton published his tax return, which shows that at that time he and his husband had a revenue of $10.75 million and the actual federal tax rate paid by them was 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charity organisations, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. The former President Bill Clinton made nearly $ 5.3 million in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, announced that he earned $3 million from his book Simon & Schuster, which dealt with his post at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Vice-President of Clinton, Senator Tim Caine of Virginia and his wife Anne Holto published ten years of tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20,3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine still look like a model for economic transparency," says Clinton's campaign assistant in Jennifer Palmier's communication.
The exact opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax information.
According to the standard, US presidential candidates have always made public their tax records, even though the law does not require them.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyer have been calling for the tax administration's audit and saying it's the reason Trump hasn't released his income data.
"Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, is yours, referring to tax information.
On Thursday, Trump's special legal assistant Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not let Trump publish his tax records until the checks were completed.
Trump's critics, including Presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members of the Republic of 2012, have said that his refusal to disclose questions about Trump's own capital, his grants to charity, business relations and many other links, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken up this issue and published a video online on Friday in which he presents prominent Republicans who are forced to release Trump's tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the matter in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every candidate for President has been doing for decades, and not public statements of taxes," said Clinton to the crowd.
According to the Politico Webpaper, Trump did not pay taxes at all, or paid little for two years in the 1990s, and New York Times's business complex quoted several tax agents and auditors that the situation could still be similar.
The federal tax rates have raised the key issue of presidential elections.
Clinton has supported the order appointed by billionaire Buffett to ensure that more than a million dollars per year earn at least 30% of the tax.
President Barack Obama is also in favour of the proposal.
Last week at the Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, the principal office of Berkshire Hathaway, appealed to Trump, where they would both disclose their tax records.
Buffet says that he has also been subject to tax control by the tax administration and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authorities, but of voters.
The Clinton campaign has been publishing tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York State, paid on average 32 per cent of the federal tax between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40,5 per cent.
Clinton's tax declaration for 2015 shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and Clinton reported the sum of dividends and interest income of USD 109 000.

Chili powder-filled raccoons for the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Natural protectors in Tanzania have found an unusual way to keep the elephants away from the human dwelling — the elephants are being bullied by throwing chili powder-filled condoms toward them.
Keino has proved effective, and a few years ago, the Honeyguide Foundation has started a campaign with the American Nature Conservancy organization, which aims to teach the villages of Northern Denmark volunteers how residents can protect their homes and the elephants they grow without harming them.
Some time ago, spears were used to intrude the elephants.
Friday is the world's elephant day dedicated to the protection of animals.
"We have seen the attitudes in these villages, because now the villagers can rely on them to keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them," says Damien Bell, CEO of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First intrudering elephants are ashamed to show with a flashlight and playin' a horn.
If this does not work, the chili cloud is to be thrown.
The multiple mixed chilli powder is placed in condoms together with the smoothest, then the end of the condom is twisted in such a way that only the ignition wire is left out.
When the ignition wire is lit, the condom explodes open and spreads a fine chilli powder cloud into the air.
Usually one spice cloud is enough to drive the elephant out.
The last way is to throw a bullet that shoots as a Roman candle into the air known as a candle and generates a loud and clear explosion.
The Jewish film director criticises the Berlinian hotel on the removal of the Israeli directional number from the Arab "creating" – RT News
The French film director, who is a Jewish film director, gave birth to a media track, when he revealed that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel did not mention the Israeli direction number in his land code list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah document on the holocaust, had his frustration at the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel by writing an open letter to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
In his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find the hotel's directional number list for Israel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which the room can be called directly.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new German capital, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann is writing.
On the other hand, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through a separate call centre.
The film director asked for an explanation of the hotel's reception.
Lanzmann writes the response of the reception officer to shocking him.
The reception officer said that the removal of Israel from the list was a "a carefully considered decision by the management of Kampinski hotels".
The reason behind this procedure was still shocking the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said, "The part of our guests is Arabs, and they demand the removal of the Israeli directional number."
The German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, said the case to be "great shame".
"Treak is shocking and shocking all of us.
It's a big shame.
And the more shameful it is, given that we are in Germany and this is the hotel chain.
No more explanations are needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says Ambassador.
The incident resulted in quite a reaction online, where it was called scandal.
Some accused Kempinski's hotel simply of giving in to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
The publication entitled "Seek" said in a publication that highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue in Kurfurstendamm street.
Der Spiegel writes the hotel's alleged charges quickly, called what happened a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"For the order to leave Israel out of the index list was never given," says Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski's representative.
It adds that the direction number has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets in the demonstration of Brazilian students
The students met with the police at Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered together to show their understanding of government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protestors.
Mellakation began when law enforcement authorities tried to break down the student population, resulting in police use of rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstrations who wanted to show their passion for government plans.
Governor Geraldo Alckmin of Sao Paulo has proposed a savings measure in which almost one hundred public schools will be closed and 300 000 students will be placed in new schools.
Some of the protestors made graffiti for walls that were temporarily opposed to Michel Temer, who was held by the President.
The student demonstration took place only a few days after the streets were met by the disparate president, Mr. Dalmal Rousseffi, in voting for the Senate in this regard.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
Since the exit of the refugees, annual trade exchange between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent, says Russian Ambassador Levan Dzhagarya.
He said that the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were abolished.
"The Russian companies continue to have existing relations with Iran, while the new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, increasing trade remains one of the priorities for cooperation between countries", says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to USD 856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5% to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to 158 million dollars.
The trade was accelerated by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record of the Iranians to travel to Russia this year.
"For the last year, the Russian Foreign Minister in Iran granted approximately 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
Iran was also among the first 20 countries to travel to Russia for the first time.
And it is not too bold to say that the record of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran in turn is relatively small, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend travel to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
The Scot Callum Skinner went to the finish line when the British won the gold of cycling
Scotland Callum Skinner challenged the reputation of the men's team in Rio's Velodro last night, when the British Tribe defended London's championship in 2012.
The 23 - year - old Skinner of Glasgow was in the role of an anchor, which he inherited from his countryman, Sir Chris Hoy, who made the legend proud when he thanked the goal and took victory from a team in New Zealand.
Britain took the surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after they had only settled in the sixth World Championships in London in March, despite the fact that Hoy had since left his competition career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specializes in the role of the first coach.
Hindes showed up at just the right time.
Hoy's decision to end the race also left a hole that Kia Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was the man to whom the British coaching believed and where they saw the potential that he now redeemed.
Hindes, with Hoy, four years ago, Kenny and Skinner won the championship in time, but in the first round, New Zealand was faster.
And the British triangle won gold during the duel.
Hindes was very close after his tour, but Kenny was working on the team's leadership team that Skinner kept.
A large part of the change was the change of the strategy so that Hindes was able to slow down the speed at a higher rate, which enabled Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy followed the view of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as a commentator at BBC and reached their award level.
The 23-year-old Skinner in Glasgow says, "I'm flattered from the chest.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We did the Olympics play at the finals and we won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win it."
After winning London 2012 Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had fallen on the track deliberately due to a bad departure.
Later, he withdrew his word, and British competitors did not have a complaint.
This time the sovereign victory was not associated with such problems.
Hindes says, "I know it was like London, all the British flags went down in the parking lot.
Our team became united in the last three months.
We have lost so many world stars that the Olympics will feel great."
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten railways both in Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the last five months, then it will be a successful five-day period.
As Kenny has shown in his abilities, it is impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympics at the Olympic Games.
This would mean taking account of six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyta and was born on 23 March (a magical date for British sports, including Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
I'd say that, uh, you know, you know, we'd have the same kind of measure as Hoy's.
Kenny's gonna race for the next sprint that starts today and settle in three days.
The 28-year-old Kenny from Bolivia says, "At this moment, I can only be happy about this.
Team race is always the best.
You can enjoy winning together with your friends.
Victory alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he'll have to get the knight's worth."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doul were the fastest in four men's team race.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record made in London in 2012 and won gold is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (kol 22.42) will be competing today on the second day of competition, and the focus will certainly be Wiggins.
He and his competitors had a dispute yesterday before the time period when the operators invited him to measure his length.
In similar competition for women, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavi reached the world record at 4:1.3.60.
The British team can now count on its awesome bike team taking responsibility for the middle of the Olympic Games and bringing a number of medals to the country.
Since actual exceptional evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, the least of which has not been the release of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sex and bullying claims, and the end of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton's competitors.
However, the competitions held on the first night show that the legendary reputation of Britain has come to the top once again at a perfect moment.
The future of the Portland merger in the light of the end of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium alloy in Portland, Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when a power plant that delivers electricity to the melting plant reported that one of the owners of the plant is about to break down the supply contract and that all delivery contracts are expected to be terminated.
This is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by Victoria's government not to continue the support for the industry's operations.
Fixed aid for 20 years will cease in November.
The Alcoan Portland plant is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
Because of the cuts, up to 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
Snowball effects can continue to increase, as the fuse consumes about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry’s fuse, resulting in the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoan Portland melter loses money and is in danger of having to close its doors.
The measures correspond to the speculators that have been used for years since the future of the plant, which were initially caused by a strong Australian dollar and a recent production price.
AGL, which delivers electricity to the large aluminium alloy from the Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says that it is also expected that the three other owners of the molten plant will cease their contract.
The joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina is made by the majority owner, the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares in the factory.
AGL says that it looks forward to the permanent operation of Portland's production plant, which means that physical electricity demand will continue from the melting plant.
The AGL states that the contracts are covered by so-called safeguard agreements, which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The term of termination of contracts is 12 months and therefore will expire in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects contracts to generate revenue in the financial year 2017," says the power plant.
The potential benefits for AGL from the financial year 2018 are currently limited by strong future market prospects for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says that it has already reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million as a "prevention of termination".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate or to secure the supply of electricity to the fuse.
The American company stated that it had concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, which was to enter into force since November of this year, although it still needs to be clarified why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
In view of the weak economic situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious about their assessment of both the melting plant in Portland in Victoria and the Tomagon plant located close to Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, operational leader of AGL, said in his speech to analysts earlier this week that, on an annual level, Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If these plants are removed from the market, this means a significant fall in demand in the electricity market.
As a producer to us, it would not be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashianit TV star Kendall as a cover girl in September Vogue
The fourth daughter, Kendall Jenner, of the Kardashian-Jenner clan and his mother and manager, Kris, 20, postage in the famous September issue of the United States Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estete Lauder's advertising casino and performs in Milan, Paris and New York fashion trends, announced the news on his Instagram account on Thursday.
"The look in the room full of my loved ones got me in tears," Kendall wrote.
The publication of the cover picture followed a strange (or perhaps just the Kardashians style?), a handwritten video with all the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (the bar alarms Rob and Caitly and all the favorite, Kardashianit producer Ryan Seacrest) who forgot their sister's cover. The video ends in a classic translation: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is cliché, and it is used in almost all stages of the program's birthday (Seacrest says: "Did you think we'd forgotten you?" as sincerely as the children's morning TV drawing character), but Krisin had to have another daughter involved in this publicity in some way.
Its appearance in Vogue's September issue means without doubt a new era of Kardashians.
Kendall's isossko Kim could get to Vogue's application before (but Vogue's application was in conjunction with his husband, Kanye West in April 2014) but the issue of September is entirely in its own category.
The number of September is Vogue's most sold published year.
A large number of advertisers are attracted to a large number of images of their thickness than the number that resembles the fashion paper (the fashion site from Fashion decreased that last year's 832 page of the study included 615 pages of advertisements).
The release of the September issue of the cover is so highly expected that during the previous two years, the pictures of the magazine have been leaked into the public before the official announcement.
Previously the cover models of September have been from Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
Over the last few years, there have been more than a model of famous celebrities than models that are famous.
The Oscar winner and Dior Mainoskasvo Jennifer Lawrence was in the cover picture in 2013, and one year later the honor was given to Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for his generation, and even though he was more likely to read the model among the working celebrities, he is still very good with him.
These celebrities are not relatives of known people, true TV stars or children of modern times who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called gifted women who succeed in the entertainment industry beyond others.
The Beyonce in the cover photo last year is behind him one of the strongest years of his career when he published his Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of his true-TV record, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be tobacco.
In June, the original model of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadidi by calling them "unfortunate".
These feelings have re-circled when the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue was published.
Yet, the constant perseverance of dissatisfaction seems to be irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for Vogue's September number.
He's a super model, in the purest sense of the word.
He walks in the fashion show of Marc Jacobs.
He's the ads of Este Lauder's makeup pot.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid applications.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, the one she shot in the LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, he appears on real-time TV, maybe just a way to meet his sister and his kids.
Legal aid centres turn 160 000 people away a year
Every year more than 160 000 people in the most vulnerable countries are turned away from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impact of additional cuts in appropriations on centres already operating at the outermost borders.
In the Queensland State, legal aid and legal services are being reversed from three out of five people – most of them are elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unwarranted decisions and similar injustices without resources being combated.
Public legal assistance services with already overburdened labour loads are preparing for additional cuts in appropriations.
Since June next year, legal aid centres are at risk of losing another 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Queensland Public Legal Assistance Centre, states that according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Organisation of Legal Assistance, thousands of people are being turned away annually.
If the federal government doesn't spin its decision, Farrell says it'll only get worse.
"Queensland's public legal aid centres are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people will be turned away when they seek the necessary services," says Farrell.
"The people who leave out of uncontrollable relations, the people under the hurdle and the burden of debt, the families that are breaking up, the workers who are unduly dismissed – all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are not able to get the help they need.
The Federal Government intends to cut funding by 30% since June 2017, which means that thousands of the poorest in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal problems without assistance.
We appeal to the Chancellor of Justice and to the Senator of Queensland, George Brandi, to immediately hand over these financial cuts so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state administration fulfilled its promise of bringing legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to take account of the needs of the public legal aid centres and their customers, and the Government of Palaszczez has to invest in this important work."
An action was brought against Donald Trump's campaign against the threat of a worker with a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was filed when none of the alleged actions had been taken since its leadership was reported that the leader of the campaign's Northern Carolina had threatened the worker with a gun in their drive to Jeep in February.
The event is described in the action brought by Vincent Bordini, former software teacher of the state campaign at the State Court on Wednesday in Charlotte.
Bordini says he's been waiting months for the situation to be dealt with inside the campaign before he realized that this was not going to happen.
Bordini says when he applied that the campaign leader Earl Phillip "took out the pistol, put his right front finger on the trigger, and pressed the pipe into Vincent's kneecap".
According to the complaint, after a complaint to the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini learned that at least four other persons had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
"Even if the gun doesn't fire, it's causing damage," says Bordin when he's wearing it.
It will only take two days after the President of the Republic has caused a common rage when he says to the crowd in North Carolina that "the supporters of the second additional step" – who will be considered as gunmen and armedists – can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets elected judges.
According to Trump's campaign staff, media cut off his word in the context and Trump did not encourage violence.
Bordini claims that the campaign should be compensated for the uninterrupted result and Phillip should be compensated for the overthrow, abuse, and suffering caused by them.
The Trump informant, Hope Hicks, did not immediately reply to a message asking for comments.
Despite the companies, Phillip was not the target.
Charlotte's local news office at WCB told me Phillip had recently left a campaign.
No immediate answer was received for Phillip's consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been campaigning indiscriminate.
Case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also stimulates the economy and creates prosperity — not only in local communities and London but throughout the country.
For me, this was the one thing that was most interested in Heathrow, and as in London's Olympics in 2012, we made a huge contribution to the benefit of our entire nation and all our regions.
The Olympics have brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
We are doing this again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we create 10,000 new places of study and 40 000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in nearby areas of the airport.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, there are always people who think Heathrow's expansion is too great a challenge.
With regard to the Olympics, I was told that Britain would never be ready for them and that we would be in the eyes of the rest of the world in an awkward situation.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they're gonna be wrong about Heathrow.
There will always be obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than many.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and increase the economy by 211 billion pounds, bringing know-how and employment both to the airport's environment and to the UK as a whole.
We have a great task force on Heathrow, which has been implemented in time and has remained in the budget for 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment, which included the T5 terminal – which has been voted for the best flight terminal in the year in two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of two world-wide runways.
Now they are ready to produce the third runway, supported by a private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The London Olympic Games in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will be the extension of Heathrow.
It is time to use the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the president of Heathrow's government and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook advertising studio in cat mouse dress
The efforts made by companies who earn their money from online advertising have become cat-moving software, says one company producing blocking programs.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook had announced on its website that it would prevent advertising programs, Adblock Plus published a blog entry, where it told us that users could update their blocking software filters and thus again block social service ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that they would change their desktop website's advertising codes so that it would be more difficult to identify which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock tells us that he's found out the new codes.
Ben Williams, a journalist from Adblock, wrote in his blog writing that "this kind of balling between an open source advertising community and delusions has been going on since the launch of the advertisements" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon do its own repairs again.
The fact that the largest social media company in the world has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the great concern that advertisers have become involved in the sector.
Globally, it is estimated that 200 million people use advertising programmes, says the research carried out last year by Pagefair and Adobe. The figure has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users on daily mobile devices, and mobile advertising is already 84% of Facebook's advertising revenues.
However, the company intends to make a contribution to misleading advertising programmes in its desktop application, since according to the notifier, mobile advertising systems do not work on Facebook mobile apps and Instagram.
The income from the Desktop advertising continues to be high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also told us to update the user settings advertising tool so that users can more control how advertisements are applied to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticises Adblock's new filters, as they also prevent some ordinary Facebook emails from being visible.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem" said Facebook informant in her email address.
"The advertising programmes are clumsy and inefficient, and that is why we have instead contributed to the development of user regulations such as advertising tools so that people can control advertising allocations themselves."
She committed suicide by leaving cars under the Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking for the help of witnesses on the highway for the first accident that took place on Thursday, in which a woman deliberately left behind several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway on the Vadi canton near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate act by laying in the dark road, and she hit more cars, says Vaud's police when she got in the news.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and her attempt was clearly to commit suicide.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, and the police are asking them or other witnesses of the accident to report.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstutter reports in Le Tribune de Geneva that a criminal investigation has been launched, a logical step in this kind of situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether there are charges against the motorists involved in the accident.
"Is it impossible to avoid collision?
It remains for the prosecutor," says Hofstitter.
Over the last five years, two similar cases have occurred, which do not constitute responsible drivers.
According to the newspaper, in either case, a person walked on a dark highway and the court decided that drivers cannot expect to crash on his pedestrian’s motorway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police officer was released from the charge against him of the death threat after he was hit by a man who was lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne in one August 2014.
The court heard that the 22 - year - old victim had enjoyed plenty of alcohol and had gone down the road.
The Court held that the police, who was responding to an emergency call, were justified and the man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredicted situation".
On Thursday, someone who knows about the accident that took place in Morges is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model that allows Venus’s past to be studied with the same tools and algorithms as the weather scientists use.
The model was designed to determine whether the conditions in Venus may have sometimes been similar to those on earth, even though Venus is hot and waterless and its gas layer consists almost completely of carbon dioxide.
According to previous presentations by researchers, the slow rotation rate of Venus is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, on the basis of the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and it has, despite this, been slow.
The model was also used to establish the early Venus surface formation.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been enough water and a geographical variation to sustain life and prevent rapid disintegration.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30% smaller.
"In the GISS model, Venus spins slowly and has a sunside per sun for almost two months at a time," says the GISS researcher in Anthony Del Genio's press release.
This warms the surface and generates rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer works like a umbrella and protects the surface from a large part of the sun’s heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are even a few degrees lower than the present Earth temperatures.
With the help of the model, Venus’s story was created that corresponds to the previous assumptions of the planet researchers regarding its development.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans disappeared, and the ultraviolet light burned steamed water.
As Vedy escaped to space, there was only a thick, carbon dioxide --like gas and a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus, as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus air model in the Geographic Research Letters.
Patrick Roy will give up his place as coach for Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice-president of the ice-cream activities of the company, calling for a lack of impact on the team’s decision-making.
Mr. Colorado's Vice-President/President Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the Society would begin immediately to apply for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I've been working for the Colorado Avalanche team as head coach and head of the ice-cracking operation of the company, with great power, passion and determination," says Roy, 50 years old in his communication.
"In the summer, I have thought hard about how I can improve the team, give it the necessary depth and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the Deputy Director-General of Coach and Society hockey must be fully in line with the organisation.
He also has a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for her contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me his decision today," says Sakic.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the best for the future."
Roy was awarded Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league year from his first season as Avalanche's head coach 2013–2014.
Under his leadership, the club got to 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not reached the next two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points in the period 2015–2016 and remained five points away from Minnesota Wild in the second Wild Card place at the Western conference.
The Hall of Fame painter Roy won four Stanley Cups — two in the lines of Montreal Canadiens and two in the lines of Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and stop strike
The lead advisors will tell us that the oil workers in the North Sea will be interrupted when I challenge all the parties involved in the new round of negotiations.
Wood Group, which provides oil-field services, has been subjected to strike in the North Sea under Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement by the parties, "Wood Group and Trade Unions Unit and RMT confirm that they have agreed to re-establish the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of the next week, we will be having a number of sustainable meetings all day long to deal with the problems of fresh aspects.
The trade unions justified their recent activities, which, according to them, were the first to exceed 25 years, as a protest against potential wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressure, the Wood Group will cut around 9 % of its suppliers operating in the North Sea this year.
The reduction in the company's tariffs is in line with the decrease in the prices of contractors working in countries by 10% in 20114.
According to the company, additional cuts give it the space needed to cope with the decline in the market.
Shell, for its part, has cut off thousands of employees and announced plans to abandon oil and gas drilling in up to 10 countries, thereby trying to enhance its operations after a megafusion with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation, which is the result of the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union in June, creates pressure on energy companies.
Mr Dave Anderson met working leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts experienced in the North Sea for a whole generation.
He said that the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that benefits many and not just the few," Anderson says.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to be under $1.4 billion in 2016, with around $7 billion spent over the last five years.
Kepler measure the speed of the stars in the Pleads Star Force
The latest task of the Kepler Scramble Copy has been to measure the speed of the stars, which has helped to collect the astronomys in order to gather the most comprehensive list of the speeds of the stars of the Plediah Scraper.
On the basis of new data, astronauts can determine why the stars in the same group run at different speeds and how the orbits relate to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing the results with the rest of the stars, we learn from the relationship between weight and age, and even the history of its solar system," says Professor Luisa Rebull, Researcher at Caltech University in Pasadena.
The Pleijad’s Stargate is located 445 light-years away from the Earth.
Many of the stars were born about 125 million years ago, meaning that they are just about to reach their adult age.
They're running faster at the moment than ever.
With the speed of rolling at the top of the adult stars, large quantities of stars are disintegrated from the stardust.
These winds have a control effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star age, its speed begins to slow down.
Kepler shall measure the speed of rotation for each star by monitoring the time between the appearance of identifiable star spots (corresponding to sunlight).
The most recent listed speed data indicate that larger stars run slower than smaller.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers — the larger are spinning slower than the smaller ones.
"We're looking at the "tance" of the Pleijads, that the slow spins are typically larger, whereas the fastest spinsters are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Since the Pleads Star Force is so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory, which allows the features of the stars to be compared to the speeds of rotation.
"The pool of stars offers a support pillar for both the theoretical models dealing with the circulation of younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to get a lot more information about how, when and why stars slow down their speeds and end their "tance".
Rebull, with his colleagues, will present his latest analysis of Pleads' speeds in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astrnomic Journal.
