The city of Juankoski is linked to Kuopio city at the beginning of 2017.
The Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the Union on Monday.
The Juankoski City Council approved the merger last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the settlement of the municipality of the municipality, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide separately on the implementation of the following royals.
The municipal elections will be held next time in 2016.
After Juankoski's accession, Kuopio's population is about 111,000.

Putin: Ukrainian troops shooting civilians
On Monday, President of Russia, Vladimir Putin accused the head of Kiev of refusing to have direct political discussions with the separatists in Eastern Ukraine.
The current leadership of Kiev does not want to implement an essential political debate with the eastern part of its country, and Putin said it was a news office according to Itar-Sass.
He also said that the Russian-minded separatists, whose Kiev and West say they were assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukraine's troops further away from their moments where Putin said that the Ukrainian army forces were shooting civilians.
The goal of millions of fighters is to push away these armed forces and their guns so that they do not have the chance to shoot the people of the region, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Rhyrm Square.
It surprised me that the crowd came from the very beginning of the night.
The visitors were expected in two days, Promotor Tom Kangas tells us.
The wall river Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year, again.
We're still going to be a hippo festival, which means the poppy's not under promise, Kangas assures us.
Finland will enter into force on Tuesday by a law restricting the acquisition of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In order to purchase or hold substances or mixtures which could be used as explosives as a so-called source material, individuals must continue to apply for authorisation from the Police Office.
Such substances include vetyperoxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium perchlorate and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them, if the concentration levels specified are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is in detergents and detergents, but concentrations do not generally exceed limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in the acceleration phase.
However, source materials obtained prior to the entry into force of the law may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster is charged with hotel rapes in Naryn and Pitochry.
The two rapes at the hotel are charged with waiting for the trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges in a sitting at the Supreme Court of Glasgow.
He was accused of rape at the Pitlochryn Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman in this "unconscious state, asleep, and in this way incapable of making a decision on her own".
In addition, Webster is charged with the second rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Highland on 4 May 2014.
In accordance with the decision of Judge Lady Rae, the case shall be held in Edinburgh on 17 November before the Supreme Court.
Valoliga: Super Raheem spelled - Mario stayed in the shadow - Valolio - Ilta-Sanomat
The 19-year-old Raheem Sterling again showed why he is considered to be the hope of the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electronic atmosphere on Sunday when Mario Balotelli, confirmed to Liverpool, arrived as Tottenham's guest.
Super Mario's first performance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working on the field with a different attitude from Manchester City.
Balotelli was still far from his peak.
The Italian lost three high-quality targets and fed only half of his sixteen baits to his own team.
Half-canners who have already taken the player's favorite look forward to better in the future.
Liverpool-manageri Brendan Rodgers placed Balotelli in Barcelona on the role of Luis Suarez as the second attacker of the team alongside Daniel Sturridge.
Instead of the Balotelli, the team starled the midfield diamond tip Raheem Sterling, who hit the 3-0 victory with an important opening goal by Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine.
The Englishman is 20 cents shorter than the fish in the water between the opponent's lines.
The feature is not common for a player who thanks the lawn at its best for about 34 kilometers an hour.
Rodgers also deserves great praise for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Ireland reported how Liverpool has systematically developed a North-Western chair, which has grown around Wembley, just a more comprehensive player.

Pistachine.
The Rovaniemi women's volley league tripped to the Vampulan Sportsmen at the training tournament on Sunday.
The vampire turned five to a three-2 win in a stretched match.
The last batch of WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was a step ahead of us all the time.
The fight was good, but in the defense game and the passport game Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyr.
WoVon's hat was so dirty that the 190-cent American senator Jennifer Tuesday was stuck in the back.
As a senator, Sara Niemi played.
Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play with Johanna Pekkarinen in spite of his thumb horse, and formed the most fireproof combination of WoVo.
When he first started, Jenna Kempäki was able to make room for Jana Jadzem for the last 1.5.
The best part of the vampire was a skilled Russian pastor and a libero Hillael Hämäläläinen, whom WoVo ran as far as possible.
WoVon’s preparation of too much will continue next weekend when Hämeenlinna’s HPK comes to the training camp for Rovaniemi.
On Saturday, the team will meet with the "trade" at 18 o'clock in the official training game.
On Sunday, they'll meet you at the sports school for a second time.
Lidl takes wild numbers in Finland
During the financial year ending at the end of February, Finland's sales sales increased by almost 25 per cent to almost EUR 1.2 billion.
The company released its profit data on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 shops in Finland, and enlargement is to be continued.
Lidl also reported that for the last financial year, taxes to Finland amounted to almost EUR 14 million.
Lidl Finland belongs to the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4 200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more common due to delayed diagnosis and access to treatment in rarely populated areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have published the video as a tribute to her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in Australia are more likely to die of ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers reviewed the patient data of more than 1,100 women with ovarian cancer diagnosis in 2005 and concluded that only 35% of women, i.e. over five years after diagnosis.
The main researcher, Susan Jordan QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, confirms that women living in rarely populated and remote areas died 20% more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
RECALLING: New medicines may slow lung and ovary cancer
Researchers went through women’s health history seven years ago.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, women’s age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovary cancer, previous diseases, and socio-economic status also affected the possibility of survival.
In older women and when cancer was more common, the likelihood of survival was low.
Women in rarely populated and distant areas died 20% more likely during the study than women in urban areas.
The study did not seek to find out why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers it possible for a delayed diagnosis and a complicated access to treatment.
"Gynaecological oncology specialist doctors are best placed to treat this disease, and their reception is mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
While remote care is becoming more frequent and the importance of distances is reduced, the researcher proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialised doctors can treat patients closer to their home, as well as programmes to support patients who are far from home.
According to Dr Jordan’s study, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor, regardless of their geographical location, which highlights the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a 33 - year - old family mother living in Gold Coast, Elisha Neavella, was found to have a malignant ovarian cancer.
The town of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the parking lot on the base of the parking lot near the Hotel Pohjanhov.
On Monday, the city government decided to set a public service point to Osviet, the proposal for a location plan for the park and its surrounding environment.
Opinions are requested from the Environment Board and the Life Centre of Lapland.
With a change in position, the city wants to make it possible to continue its motor vehicle activity in the area of tourism.
It is intended to form a park area that keeps within the area between the existing area of friendship and the existing area between it and the river.
According to the proposal, for the period from 15 November to 30 April, a maximum of 200 snowmobiles shall be permanently available.
The area shall also be allowed to place anchorage points for a specified part.
The new park area will also be allowed service traffic.
The town of Rovaniemi has rented the area of the Family Park for safari companies to use snowmobiles during the winter season.
The lease agreement has been renewed last spring 2014 and the contract will be in force in spring 2018.
Even loud voice opposition has been raised by electric parking and design change.
The inhabitants of the neighboring worlds have been so full of vote and concern about emissions.
However, the area's emissions have been examined and the findings have not shown any findings beyond the reference values.
The new equipment is also less than old.
The park as a parking area also supports the fact that, if the place of departure were to be moved further, the safari customers of the hotel should be transported to safari destinations by buses, which would have an estimated 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and the surrounding environment of the park of friendship are also large enough, better than the places of replacement, such as the eastern entrance of the boat station on the bridges of the Ounasjoki.
The park for friendship is also good for its location because future activities can expand, for example, in the Ounaspaviljong region.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of the urban strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, which aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business by providing sufficient quality areas to places that are logistics and functionally advantageous.
The park of friendship is also marked as the point of departure of the snowmobiles and the central assembly, which has not yet received law.
You can see the decline in housed apartments in garden shops
A reduction in the number of residents, especially in the group under 35 years of age, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden shops by tens of millions, when today's young consumers achieve their age in favour of the 'main destination group'. Financial Times reported a survey by the UK Trade Association (HTA).
According to the Financial Times report, housing owners use only 55% of the amount of money used by housing owners to care for gardens.
The investigation also showed that more and more people live in very urban dwellings without gardens and that the size of the garden is reduced when the front yard is increasingly covered into parking areas, and these factors also threaten the garden area with an estimated value of about 5 billion pounds per year.
In the big London area, housing ownership has decreased from 61% to 43% in six years, where garden products spend the least money per household in the whole country.
However, according to the HTA and the British horticultural association (RHS), the increase in renting of dwellings or the decrease in size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
RHS' leading garden advisor Guy Barter says that "for example, plants grown in transferable growing plants are particularly popular among housing owners, as such breeding plants can be included in their changes if necessary".
According to the HTA report, the 1997-2005 period for the sale of gardens was a coup because housing ownership and wealth increased from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that this year's trade will increase due to better weather conditions, the worse it was last year's March and April's weather.
Turkey is questioning US diplomats for the spying report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the country's most experienced U.S. diplomat to report on the American and British spying in Turkey.
According to Vice-President Bulent, the U.S. Ambassador and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the website The Intercept have written that the documents issued by the former analyst Edward Snowden by the National Security Agency (NSA) reveal that Turkey was the main target of the US and UK intelligence services.
According to the Turkish news offices, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reduced the importance of the report, saying that all the large countries have guaranteed each other.
The previous report on spying for Ankara, the German main intelligence service, caused a more angry reaction to the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze appears in a new Finnish film
A number of Canadian performers, Marie-Josée Croze, are attached to the female main part of the new Finnish film.
Croze plays director in Mikko Kuparise's film 2 nights in the morning, whose photos start this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the best female premiere of the Cannes Film Festival in the Barbarian Invasion in 2003.
He has been performing, among other things, in Steven Spielberg's film München and Julian Schnabel's film, in the glass wilderness of Perhone.
There's Mikko Nousinen in the male film 2 nights till morning.
The film will be released first night of Finland in September 2015.
Chief of Police of Mallorcan Magaluf, accused of corruption
The complainants provided evidence of the blackmail of the police and the officials of Calvià city government at Mallorca's Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Chief of Police of Calvià, located on the island of Mallorca, has been arrested as a result of the reports of corruption by the traffic and bar owners of the Magaluf area known for wet celebration.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was put in custody after several traffickers on the Punta Ballena street presented corruption charges against him. The Punta Ballena street is situated in the majority of the Magaluf bars and night clubs.
According to the newspaper Mallorca Diario on the Internet, the evidence of the blackmail of the police and the officials of Calvià city government at the Office of the Prosecutor's Office against the corruption of Mallorca on Friday was provided by the case.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with the charges of corruption, and they are interrogatory with Navarro.
The ABC magazine, which is published throughout the country, wrote about the neutrality of the angry authorities of the night club owners, which made a significant contribution to their business.
"There is no more money in the case, but survival," said one businessman to the court.
You're not gonna destroy our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in several countries in the headlines of magazines this summer when the online YouTube video was spread, where 18-year-old British holidayer spent oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub cracklin period.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to control the futile and uncontrolled use of Magaluf holidayers by reducing the share of the evil, alcoholic pub crawlies.
In addition, the Playhouse Night Club, where the ski video was filmed, was assigned to be closed for a year, and the owner of the night club and the organiser of the pub cracklin Carnage were jointly ordered to pay a fine of EUR 55 000.
Above all, among young British tourists, its recommendation at the Magaluf tourist destination has also become a popular trend called Balconing, which has caused several kinds of alcohol-related accidents since people jumped from a balcony to another pool or a balcony.
The children of Israel will return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of children from Israel returned to school in the Gaza Strip after the summer of Monday in the bomb shields, when rockets and grenades bombed their communities for 50 days in the war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools remained closed as the region recovers from battles.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in the southern Israeli communities bombarded by rockets, but there are still signs of battles.
At Pashosh Day Home in the south of Ashdod, workers removed the traces of shrapnel from the walls and slides before the children entered the rocket’s home.
"We're a little scared, but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbuts, Israeli community, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area desperately need routines.
The 11-year-old daughter of Bart, Shani Bart, thinks she's going back to school in a long time, feeling "a little weird".
"We've sometimes had difficult times when we didn't leave home," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbuts near the Gaza border for his support.
Before the start of the last week’s ceasefire, thousands of people in the border area like Saami had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community in the vicinity of Gaza are suspicious of the return of the Palestinian grenade killed in the 4-year-old boy's community.
According to the Ministry of Education, the fair ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited the school in Sderot, near the Gaza border, a city targeted by heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "children' education and safety will be ensured".
So far, Israel and Hamas agreed on the current ceasefire on Tuesday.
Whether the battles were interrupted immediately, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas' demand for the removal of the island of Israel and Egypt and the re-opening of Gaza.
Israel wants to remove Hamas from his weapons, and return the body of the two Israeli soldiers who have fallen in war.
In Egypt, a new round of indirect negotiations is expected later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2 100 Palestinians died in war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of dead men, saying that at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it did not have sufficient evidence of this.
66 soldiers and six civilians, including Thai workers, were killed with Israel.
Hamas and other Gazans shot 4 591 rockets and grenades in the cities of Israel mostly south.
In turn, more than 5,000 air attacks and other attacks were carried out by the Israeli army.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people fled to protect more than 100 UN schools that had been transformed into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in protective custody and as the battle continued, the school authorities moved the school’s beginning last week.
"I hope that school will open soon and we will get back to school, just as other children in the world and just as the Jewish children," said the 13-year-old Mohammed Amara, who lives in a school in Gaza City.
According to the generally used meter, housing prices have risen most to seven years in the winter months of Australia.
The RP, which measured the prices of housing houses in the capital of Australia, rose by 1.1 per cent in August, from RP's data on Monday.
As a result of the rise, the increase in prices in summer, July and August was 4.2 per cent, or more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but the prices have not risen steadily throughout the country.
According to Tim Lawless, RP Data's research director, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price increase.
RP Data results show that housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and 11.7 per cent in Melbourne last year.
The housing market for Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is the following most lively; the average price increase is from 5 to 6 per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent a year as a result of government expenditure cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring started in Australia increases the number of dwellings sold over the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"In view of the increase in the sales of auctioned dwellings, the generally lively sales pace and the continuing low interest rate, it is likely that the price increase in housing will continue over the next three months", Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences from Mäntta
The new museum and art have drawn record-like audiences this summer from Mäntä.
By the end of August, more than 70,000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June, and there have been pop-art classic works from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttä's art week, again, told us that he had a visitor record on Monday, when 14 500 people visited this summer.
These figures have not been used.
The people have been flat on doors and windows," says the director of Pauli Sivonen Serlachius.
Sivonen estimates that the total number of visitors throughout the year will be 100 grand this year at Serlachius Museums.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mäntta-Vilppula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11 000 inhabitants.
Sivonen, the museum leader, recalls that the new museums are always opening up phenomena.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
It is hoped that the art season will continue far beyond the summer.
In autumn, new exhibitions will be opened.
Police are investigating four thefts in Kajaan last few days.
On Sunday night in the North River wired commercial estate was broken by breaking the window.
The author had received a small amount of money from the cashier.

A couple of suspects were stolen by the police already.
On Sunday night in Tikkapurontie, business property was broken.
The police dog got a print and a 20-year-old Palestinian man was found in the woods hiding under a tree.
On Monday, the police captured another man from Palma, who is also suspected of being guilty of the same break.
Lost amphetamine brought a murder charge in Kajaan.
The disappearance of ten grams of amphetamine in need led to the murder of a man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to the apartment with his partner and another man and shot the drug exporter as a suspect of the owner, 34-year-old Kajaan woman.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed he was with another man as a shooter.
The case became known to the police when the police force stopped a passenger car with a partner burning the clothes used in the blood work.
In addition to burned clothes, there was a cut-off shotgun in the car.
The Court of Justice of Kainuu will give judgment in the matter later.
August was rarely warm in many places.
According to an air science institution, as warm August is repeated once every ten years.
According to the weather science institution statistics, the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
Most of the country's deviation was one of two degrees.
As a result of hay and August's heat, the whole summer was warmer than usual.
The whole summer’s highest temperature was measured during the first week of August in the Por, where the meter showed 32,8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never despised me."
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born in the seven children from Jamaica to the migrant family in Dudley in the British Midlands region in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory, and Henry died when he was 19.
Henry is currently practicing Rudy's Rare Records for a comedy show, which is partly based on his father's imaginary conversation and developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
There's a mix of strings of rorgata and rappies in the upbaat pace.
Henry's had to go through all the bitter childhood memories.
He's been on therapy several times since his mother died, and he's been thinking a lot about his relationship with his father.
Dad was very hard to read.
He never saw his face, only the voice said, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at the criticals now.
My parents Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, visited pub with my father and discussed, for example, the form of beer or the beauty of a critical meal.
I never talked to him about such things.
Most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal alloy in Dudley and had this idea of what his father’s life must have been like, even though working conditions are better today than at that time.
The melting plants are a little brighter today, but they are practically dark, smoke-like, Labyrinth depths, which are falling into flames, smoke and sows, and which remind you of that.
My father used to go to the bath and only the ground in the tub, and he began to sing for himself when he washed off the dirt of the melt.
As I walked around the bridge, I realized that he had been doing that work for years to get us food at the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry’s childhood was missing the proximity of his parents.
My father never hated me and never said he loved me.
Only when my mother started to get sick a little before she died, we began to each other, that we love each other.
Henry has Billie's daughter, Dawn French, and through her own child, she has been able to share the love that she was missing as a child.
Do you have to repeat "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22.
With Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend to French with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to the mother's death.
When I started suffering from excessive overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
After that, I began to practice a lot, and I also had to start a hard diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult...
and boring.
Nobody likes eating carrots.
Henry's well-known short beard may be the image of his change in career development.
After receiving much good feedback from critics for his role as Othello, he is embedded in doing the theater.
Next, the comedy comedy of Erehdys and August Wilson's Fences ("Aids").
The theater’s work offers a variety of experiences such as quotes and comedys that Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started the business when he was only 16 years old.
One of them noticed him doing impressions on stage and contacted New Faces.
Henry's TV career started in the middle of the '70s. "How long have I been the only black impressionor and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned how to work.
I had to grow into an adult in the light world of publicity, and I had to learn to produce jokes from the whiskers in 1975 to 1985, while I was on the star of the life and on TV.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had the rights to play The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people were blacked, so Henry ended up in comics for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never taken part in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and diabolical, I was able to work on huge events and learn how the audience is being treated.
Still, the "British-tv awarded, multi-annual favorite and light entertainment program" was the same as the "impossible parody of black people".
Henry worked in another comedy series in the '80s, where both the ruins and the admired the black British culture.
The Lenny Henry Show's first episode was presented in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known for example as a chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
The following decade Henry spent on commercials, documentarys, TV series and cinemas, but after his LennyHenry.tv series in BBC in 2008, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len – now it looks like you're just standing or going on a side track".
Next up was Radio 4 documentary series "What's So Great About...?"
The first part discussed Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not really taught us properly at school, and I think it was part of the white middle class that wears stockings and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare issue brought fear in me.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, "Come on.
Don't give up the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Meet words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 sets of Othello's last speech for a document and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It seemed almost like some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what this is all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your bag, do a little background study.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was done.
The play was finally a success.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but that wasn't exactly what happened.
Soon after that, Henry played the main part of Erehdy's comedy.
Suddenly, I was acting at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't really believe it was true.
At one point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
Once in the play, there were technical problems, and Henry clearly felt that his job was to entertain the audience.
"A small voice in my mind said to me, "You have to do it by yourself for 10 minutes until the computer works again."
Instead, the director announced that the presentation would be continued as soon as the problem had been corrected.
I walked out of the stage, and some of me felt relieved.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to the others.
"You're part of the play, stay in your role."
Henry's "Fences" show at the Duchess Theatre
It was challenging to learn "Fences" from the mountains.
Panic is a good thing. It makes people more sustainable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you must do."
This is what Henry says, of course, with a voice.
So I decided to stick around here.
I sincerely love this job.
I love training rooms.
However, Henry continues to be basically a comedian: small boys of humor are constantly interrupting our conversation when changing from one impression to another.
To refrain from Standup is a matter of will, as it seems dangerous to receive immediate praise from an unknown public.
If you keep thirsting it, it can lead to a dead end.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time at Apollo Theatre when it feels like it, but generally it doesn't inspire me the same way I used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna go to the new stand-up tour anymore.
It gives me real joy to sit together with the director, who will help shape the entire journey from the beginning, the middle and the end, and I do not think I would ever give up that feeling.
So this is his new birth?
I think so.
I like acting...
It's really funny.
The play is constantly telling the story, and I enjoy it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Keni's making a register of officials to remove the "boilers"
Kenia has begun to draw up a biometric register of officials trying to remove "employers" from the government pay lists.
Workers who were not registered in the register within the next two weeks would no longer be allowed to pay, were informed in the government notice.
The government doubts that thousands will continue to be paid after they have left office duties.
President-in-Office of the General Secretariat of the Council. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Kenya, he promised to engage in corruption in the public sector after he entered office in 2013.
The audit carried out earlier this year shows that at least a million dollars were spent on the remuneration and other economic abuses of "employers" in the month.
The government doubts that wages will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left his official duties, the report by BBC Wanama Chebusir of the capital city Nairobi.
All officials should report themselves to the register during the next few weeks in the identification centres to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric registration form, reported in the Government’s notice.
According to the information, any person who fails to do this without due cause shall be removed from the paylist.
"This measure makes a significant rationalization of the public sector, as it defines how many people are actually working, and this also cleans up pay lists at both levels of the government, so solves the problem of "compulsors"," says Anne Waiguru, officials of the Ministry of Dispersion and Planning.
The revenue for the 2015 financial year may remain EUR 25,5 million deficit if the city does not adjust its operations and expenditure developments in a tight economic situation.
On the basis of the current draft budget, the annual average is about 9,4 million deficits.
Possible means of efficiency were the extension of the scope and level of services and the purchase of services, the sale of assets and the increase of tax and tax revenues.
The EUR 10 million Karsin target for investment is 8,5 million.
There is no relief in the situation of municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, increasing unemployment and a 5 % reduction in public shares will further weaken the outlook.
The aim of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The City Government agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be translated into the objective of the strategy, says Kimmo Heinonen, President of the City Government.
The city government returned the presentations that were made to prepare the management team.
The urban government's proposals are based on budget preparation at the council's economic seminar in Frami on Monday 8 September.
Following the council seminar, the draft budget is moving forward to the city government and to the city council through the municipal committee.
Tens of Turkish police officers arrested against the "juon" government
In total, 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspects of 'the anti-government plots', local media sources tell.
The police did not comment immediately.
According to the Daily News, 14 senior police officers were arrested.
Some of the policemen were involved in corruption investigations last December targeted at government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, a number of police officers were arrested in Turkey for organising large-scale criminal marriages and monitoring of telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was the prime minister during this period) said that the police were part of the activities of the Islamic leader Fethallah Gulllen, who had planned action against him and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but he said that he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September was not spent in every school.
There is no peace throughout Ukraine.
We have to fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, the whole giant Ukrainian border, must fight for peace.
Alexander Pastukhov, who acts as the leading teacher at Slaviansk School, where the daughter of Yatsenyuk attends, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back here and that children can learn something that will benefit them in the future.
Traditionally, children’s written shirts, balloons, and giving flowers to teachers are part of the first day of school.
According to Perry in Texas, the twite was unauthorized.
On Sunday night, the Twitter account of Governor Rick Perry, Texas, was sent by an overwhelming picture of the democratic district attorney in the middle of this hearing of accusations of misuse of power.
Tweetti was later removed, followed by a new Tweetti, where Perry swore that he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweetti was sent unauthorizedly from my account.
"I do not accept the Tweet and have deleted it," said the later publication.
Perry's backup team did not immediately reply to the clarification request.
Although the Tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it's unclear who published the picture.
The first receipt contained a repressive image of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of a race in April 2013.
Perry prevented Lehmberg from financing the office when he refused to resign, which led to a large jury meeting in Austin this month while Perry was accused. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential elections.
The title of the Tweet was: "I don't always drive drunk, three times allowed with larger prommels... but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for showing his finger."
I'm the humanist Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office didn't conduct a large jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was carried out by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor at San Antion, who was assigned by the Republican Court.
Perry said he was innocent and called charges for political running.
His influential judicial team has asked the judge to reject the accusations and said that the law on the prosecution of the governor who was the worst in Texas is indiscriminate against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million of state aid to the state's public inviolence unit operating in Travis County and handling public charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry’s decision was made to the left by the monitoring team that was drawing up an official complaint on the matter.
Perry's confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes famously.
After arriving at the fifth election meeting in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the game by publishing a picture of himself on Twitter, flying on a lake, "This is where I come from, South Carolina!" together.
Berkeley says the housing market is once again "normal"
One of London's most important architects has warned that the housing market in south-east England has "palled" to a normal level of activity.
The capital of London's homes has been undermining huge demand and a sharp rise in prices while there has been fear of a widespread spread of credit on the planet, which led the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
On Monday, the founder of the high-level builder Berkeley and President Tony Pidgley said that "the market and the number of shops have returned to normal since the end of 2013," and added that this has enabled the "sustainable operating environment".
In London's housing market, foreign investors went to the capital in a very slow time.
According to the land register, housing prices in the city rose by 18,5 per cent only in the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the English and Wales average, which was 6,7 per cent.
The average sales prices of the private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose by about the fifth year before reaching a price increase of 423 000 pounds by the end of April.
However, in recent months, the strengthened weight has made London a less attractive object - some of the interest has also been influenced by the new real estate tax laws and political retortics on the possible "kartano" tax before the general elections in May.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported more stringent loan orders, would lead to lower market growth in terms of both sales volumes and prices of real estate in the second half of the year.
The Bank of England's recent information showed on Monday that the number of loans accepted fell in July, which refers to a cooled housing market.
The real estate agent Hamptons International has calculated the 2015 forecast of London's real estate prices; according to this, prices fall by three per cent because the housing owners' opinion index has already started to decline.
The number of shops made in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen in the fourth quarter of the year, says the real estate broker WA Ellis.
The demand for home in capital, however, is a blessing to Berkeley, who raised income from the sold properties to over 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed product in the best places has remained stable and therefore sales have remained lively".
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year preceding April, which is almost a third more than at the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
The annual profits before taxes increased by 40% year-on-year, thus by 380 million pounds and turnover by 18% to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday, before the Annual Meeting of the Company, Pidgley stated that Berkeley’s annual earnings correspond to the current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the pre-tax profit for the whole year is 450 million pounds.
Berkeley's stock was sold at 23,96 pounds in London's stock exchange this afternoon.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's naked images into the network.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards Awards Awards.
A hacker who claims to hold pictures of 100 other stars poured out an Oscar actor in Jennifer Lawrence's infecting Internet.
The star star representative confirmed that the images are real and condemned the hacker's "inviolable violation of privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishs the stolen pictures of Jennifer Lawrence will be charged with charges.
The images that were originally published on the 4chan photo publication page had apparently come to the wrong end because of the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. For the sake of 100 other hacking, it is said that there are dozens of other female stars such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed told.
It is not known how much of the pictures are real, but Scott Pilgrim versus the World Star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
"For those who look at pictures of me and my husband's privacy years ago: hopefully you have a good mind," Winsted said.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series, however, denied the authenticity of the images and quoted that "the so-called naked images of me are a WIFE, don't you understand".
Let me end this immediately.
On Sunday, BuzzFeeden announced that the representative of Aria Grande denied the authenticity of the stars.
The only thing we have about Howard Jacobson's new novel that's been given thanks to us, which tells us about love and the letter "J"
They slipped, and it best pictured what happened, and they gradually cut off each other like a cardboard box that was left out of the rain.
Only at times did she hear from a woman that she was too serious, too weak, intense, to be disintegrated, and perhaps also a little tight.
That's when he shriveled his hand.
He identified everything.
Yeah, he was a sticky, like a pig.
His last victim had been in the early stages of a relationship that had, however, been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have made it easier for him to become lonely, and it might have brought his life even with some content.
Alin’s Solomons had unsatisfied hair and he was a delicately tender beauty with a merry heart, a northern village, which was even more terrible and further away from everything that Port Reuben had.
He had come to the south with an older traveling partner, whom Kevern assumed to be his aunt. The aunt had inherited a house that was located in a wet but paradise valley, and the name of the valley was suitable for the Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, all the bathrooms had spiders, and they had left their trails in the windows, keeping the whole place in their own windows, and in the garden there were potholes that resembled the giant cabbages.
The cabin was like children's rain, at the same time threatening and magical, garden full of secrets.
According to author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is available as the winner of the Booker Prize in 2014.
The candidates will be released next week.
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailin in a broken steel chair in the middle of a long hare, enjoying a surprising warm spring afternoon, both listening to a diverse reception, through which the whole country heard calming music and calming news, when Ailin’s baptized, sun-roasted feet brought to mind a song that had been singing long ago by an forgotten black performer, and his father had often listened to the cottage’s enchants at the bottom.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were basically too aggressive, and they were no longer played in the receiver.
They were not banned — nothing was actually prohibited — they were not just called anymore.
They wanted to be forgotten, as did the word unhola.
The public opinion produced what had not been achieved by the law and the declaration: just as the people in the field of literature chose to read heroic monuments, cooking books and romances, they prefer Ballades for music.
As the day was wilded, Kevern started to play with the key to an imaginary piano and sings serenadia to the big nobles of Ailin, with a rucksy crowd.
Ailin didn't understand.
"It was a jazz pianist of Fats Waller's famous song," Kevern told him, and he also naturally lifted two fingers in front of his mouth.
His father had always done this before the "j" book ran away from his lips.
It had started as a game between her and her father when she was little.
His father told me he played the same game with his father.
If you let a word beginning with a j - mouth of your mouth, and you did not remember to raise two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't very funny to play at the time, and it wasn't even now.
He knew they were expecting it from him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
I've never heard anything like that before.
Jazz was not actually banned, it was not just called.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room in life for one word.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing happened to the clever one.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the cleverness of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10 years, the jazz music had become familiar with him through his father's half-naked CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
Considering Ailin’s age, he was likely not to remember the time when popular singers were not black.
This didn't have to be laws, nor did it have to be forced.
The famous society meant that each of its parts, thankfully, accepted, was the principle that each group did its natural things.
Based on their temperaments and their physical qualities, the Abro-Charibian family roots are best suited to entertain and sport, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian continent, they were like naturally talented electrical equipment, so they had to make sure that each family had a working phone that was used to handle things.
Those remaining in the Polish community worked as pipelines; the last Greeks broke the board.
At the time when SE, AS TAPAHTUI, JOS TAPAHTUI came to pass, they were from the Gulf and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not escaped in the fear that they would be charged with the desolation of flames and fear that those flames would reach them next, opened up restaurants in which they had served the Labneh Lawur and burned water pipe, and continued their life’s eyes in the ground, in a depressed way.
Everyone must follow their gifts.
Ailin had only heard the Ballades, and it was hard for him to understand how Kevern’s words, which had just been broken, could never be dressed as music.
Through music, love was expressed.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except for the bigfoots.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion for safety.
No word would pass through the recording of the giant cabbage leaves.
Still, Ailin didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to raise two fingers on his lips with Ailin.
I mean, I thought she was weird already.
"It was fun," he said instead.
Aili fell her head in disbelief, and her hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
There's nothing to see in the whole world but Ailin's huge, icy hairball.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you say so," he said but you didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
A year seemed truly confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your legs aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for him.
"I find you attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix it.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This wasn't helping.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different because, like his father, the convincing charm in which joke cruelty can prevail was missing.
Maybe his father had meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailin Solomons braided and rose from his steel chair, and at the same time poured out the receiver and poured out the wine they had just drank.
The wine was made only from the back pan, so he could not use it as a result of a collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake like leaves of palm tree in a storm.
"And your fat head is what appeals to me in you," he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Ailin, for his own, unnecessary, cruel words, and for the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment Ailin decided to stand up against him.
Did Ailin think he was gonna hit her?
He had never told Kevern his life in the north, where he had grown up, but Kevern was certain that basically it had been just like life here.
It's the same big, giant sea that waved against them.
The same mixed men, though even more pale and diabolical than their smuggler and scattering parents, walked from pub to pub, ready to beat every woman who dares to resist or scream at them.
Fat head?
He'd still see a fat fist if he wasn't careful!
First suck — kissing had become the most common word about man and woman’s erotic encounter; the recipient’s anti-Puppeting anti-Puppeters — suck first and then attack.
Kevern thought it was too much, for it was already hostile in itself.
The body language of Alinin Solomons told him to leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailin also felt dizzy, but Kevern’s grief surprised him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailin followed him — just as his traveling partner looked at Kevern’s ride from the upstairs window — a man who was himself responsible for his heavy life.
He's leaving the garden, he's thinking.
He felt pity for Kevern and his men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to attack him.
The man who turned his back, the confounded, the man who had lost all the will of battle — why did he feel that the vision was so familiar to him even though he did not remember that he would have seen it before this moment?
When Ailin Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the recent event, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private facility measuring the general mindset in Ofnow, made a brief study of the continued violence of a small and medium-sized man in the areas of the country where the decline of violence, or even the end of violence, was most likely to take account of its money and energy used for its exploitation.
"A lot has already been achieved, and much has still been done," he wrote, "which can be set up for thousands of years in his struggle and most often the natural aggression of the winning people, especially in those abandoned and remote sections, where, despite the church towers beyond the bushes, human perfection is rarely known in time.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it creates.
The nation weeps among the sentimental Ballads, covet stories about the anointed abuses and swears on the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, but also the old-fashioned cruelty keeps both rural communities and urban social housing in its unbridled grips, and there is also evidence of a new kind of conflict in homes, workplaces, streets and even play parks.
"You have to regret the tendency to dramatize," her director commented after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum put his eyes on the ground.
And I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I believe I don't have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme still appealed not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I'm not asking," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I am opposed to atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
No prejudice is maintained at this workplace.
We are servants of unforeseeable society.
While some kind of hypersensitivity is completely acceptable and respectful in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcome, the kind you have just presented me.
Clearly, you have something against the church — and what you call cruelty or malignancy, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
It's like it happened yesterday, if it happened at all, that it will destroy the country's fundamental vital vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around when he spoke of Rabinowitz.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, the flaming pink LED-light declared a guide that Ofnow had already distributed to the country in the fourth or longer of the previous century.
Smile to your neighbor, respect your partner, listen to the Ballades, visit the musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than quiet and singing the word is better than written, but nothing wins love.
"I understand well what you want to say", Esme Nussbaum replied with a silent voice when he was certain that his director had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effective as we think ourselves were.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find that we are repeating the same mistakes that originally led to the SILEHEN, how we would like to see them.
This time, though, we do not pour out our hatred and mistrust to others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his finger.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "as you describe as "in error" the actions that our grandparents may have done or not done.
You will also go too far when you say that they poured out their anger and mistrust to others.
A person like you should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about 'we' or 'they'.
There was no 'we' or 'other'.
It was chaos time, that's all we know about it.
"If we are absolutely honest, in that chaos," Esme was afraid to continue, "No group of society can say that he had behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was good or bad.
It was then.
There is no need to talk about this – we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to hand out accusations, there is no need to make adjustments, whether they are appropriate or not, and even if there is some way of doing them.
But for what purpose does the past exist if they don't learn from it--
The past exists so we can forget it.
If there's one more thing I can add...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said and expressed that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, as usual, he was hit by a biker driving on the sidewalk, described by passers as "serious and furious".
There's a lot of coincidences.
The Lesotho Army denies the attack; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The officials of the Lesotho army have denied that they set up a government attack against the police suspected of trying to armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane escaped from the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and had taken over government buildings in the capital of Maserusa.
The Head of State traveled with his family to the neighbouring country after telling us that he was in danger of death.
Major Ntle Ntoi said no to attack and said that this was how the army responded to the threat that came from "political fanatics".
"Lesotho's Defence Forces took action on a number of intelligence reports that some of the police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics while they were ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America News Office.
The President of the South African government, Clayson Monyela, said that military action seemed to be a revolutionist.
"Although no body has claimed to have reversed the government by means of force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces appear to be signs of a revolution in all aspects," he says.
According to the officials of the Lesotho army, soldiers return to their troops on Sunday, and there was a calm atmosphere in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he thinks he's a target of action because he's been trying to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended the parliamentary sessions because of the differences between the government of the great coalition.
He denies such a decline in government power, even though it is claimed otherwise.
Newspaper: Microsoft will set up a data center for New Zealand
Microsoft has set up a large data center for New Zealand, where the company does not agree to specify its location.
In a report sent to Microsoft Media, the company notes that it does not indicate the location of all its data centres for safety reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's Microsoft's investment of hundreds of millions of dollars.
In public, the Centre had previously been swept into Oulu or Kajaan.
Microsoft will stop all of Oulu's office, which will take about 500 people to work.
All in all, Microsoft has announced that it will quit in Finland with up to 1.050 jobs.
Microsoft's Communication Director Camilla Lindfors tells the STT that the company does not comment on how much staff the new data center employs.
On Monday, the Chamber of Commerce informed the Uusimaa about the establishment of the Data Centre.

Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos under water, you will have several options to choose from.
The best option is water-sustainable, compact point-and-shot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both cost around $300.
I myself took these photos at a family party using several different cameras, each cost less than $350.
No matter what, there are a few rules that you should follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other parts are closed in a watertight way.
In addition, set the camera description settings to match the images or video to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and video camera have a regulation to optimise the conditions under water.
Furthermore, before you jump into the water, make sure that your device is deep.
Some cameras only last for 5 feet, others for up to 50-60 feet.
Get to know both our usual and watery models in our shopping guide and our digital cameras reviews.
Take several pictures — many of them fail in some way.
There is a LCD display in compact cameras that allows you to customize the image, whereas the action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have a LCD, it is hard to see under water, and the assembly of the image can either succeed or fail.
So take a number of pictures.
In addition, if your camera allows gripping, which means taking multiple images at a time using different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will be significantly reduced in depth.
If possible, stay close to the surface while you describe the pool, lake or sea.
This also gives you more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the target.
This is important advice on how to describe the land, but even more important under water, because the light conditions are tight.
It is very important when an action camera is used: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, i.e. the photographer must be close to the target to fill the entire frame of the picture.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders — the protestors swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters would not be allowed to choose candidates for the 2017 elections despite the unrest of a growing democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a spark to the long-awaited protests of Hong Kong's business block as activists start planning and implementing mental expressions only hours after the decision has been published.
The decision of the People's Congress of China gives practically the communists power to eliminate all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was expected, but it is still shocking," says the President of the Democratic Party, legislator Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kongers.
It is clear that we are dealing with a self-governance regime.
Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Congress of China, defended the Chinese administration, saying that the general candidate for the opposition to the Hong Kong Head would be too "cooperative".
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom was given to Hong Kong China, Beijing promised to the people of the region that it should choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to the Chinese leaders, Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough, because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to control the electoral process strictly through the appointment committee, which is managed by Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the land and love Hong Kong" are accepted.
The summer before the decision was taken in Hong Kong, some of the largest and most prominent protests in the region were held for years.
A large part behind the campaign to defend democracy was Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organisers have threatened to prevent the business block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal right to vote.
On Sunday night, only hours after the decision was published, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central movement met in the rain before the Hong Kong headquarters buildings.
In the demonstration, the organisers of the movement announced that the movement would move to a new era of civil integrity and would create protests in the coming weeks.
Obviously, however, they did not share the details, fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In their communication on the network, the organisers said that the business "is considered the last resort to the Occupy Central stamp, which will only be introduced if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way".
We are very sorry to announce that today's last chance for dialogue has become a waste of time and that the power of the centre will come to an end.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday, security activities were tightly near the main buildings of the government, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, a lot of people feel that the inhabitants are slowly losing power in their city.
The wave from the mainland has led to competition from products and services.
Furthermore, there is fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, will disappear under the increasing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten the living conditions of Hong Kong — the business world.
"The protest that they are talking about can lead to major economic losses, depending on how many people take part and how long it lasts", says legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticised business.
We do not want to see Hong Kong swept away from us.
This kind of image would be bad for setting up.
The media of the Chinese state has also set out stories that Hong Kong's democratic activists are the huts of the Western powers of the revolution".
This summer, activists held a referendum on non-formal voting rights involving 780 000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.

U.S. Prom tradition attacks British universities: private students
We will respond to the demand by setting up the first class travel form in Britain for today's students.
In addition to the private aircraft, the company also offers other means of transport such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 so that the customer can ensure the most eternal arrival at the university.
Stewart says there is also a security aspect in the service.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their assets across the country in cars loaded under their edges.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are prepared to offer students as easy and high-quality transport as possible.
According to the company's representative, no reservations have yet been made, because the service has just been set up, but added that "students are starting orders over the next few weeks".
The company believes that there is demand for the service, although most students pay 9 000 pounds of annual fees.
Today's students are very different from their expectations and hopes from 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago starting their studies. Now is more important than ever to create an eternal first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Organisation criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to Mr Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Institute for Higher Education, "this service plan seems to be very far away from the life of the student majority".
In this month, many of their studies start to shock the level of living costs when the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has remained behind the huge increase in basic costs, and the next thing we can only start to think about is where thousands can be used for as simple as possible and for campus.

Balls: Fans' incentive almost too much: Sasu Salin was sneeze on the field
The basketball Sasu Salin was the body of the Finnish victory today.
He was able to forget his match with the United States of America and backs his second half of Ukraine's blood - standing solutions.
But Salin transferred all the glory to the sushians, and he did it in style:
I was going to go down there at the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
In my eyes, my fog, nothing.
That noise and the white public sea was almost too much for me.
Salin’s power rates included nine surfaces in a quick pace, pallores, records, and temmelettes in every place that happened.
I don't know how it turned out, but I got into a flute state like that, it all worked out.
They're just coming in somewhere sometimes, and now it's totally important, Sasu was glowing.
It's my role.
Do all that.
Now it was great to see the others caught up with the plan.

After 32 years of break in Finland's World Championships: The former thought of a serious trial game
Heikki Montonen, who carries the cat, was the main coach of Finland at the Argentina World Championship in 1982.
It's been 32 years since the Finnish men's volleyball team played the World Cup the last time.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and the current player-agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosone and Parkkali remember the tournament one thing like yesterday: it was a hot match against France in the beginning.
"In that match resolution balls, the court game was dirty," recalls Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already been on the back line.
All of a sudden, the game was continued.
We lost it in 2-3, and then the passports went crazy," said Parkkali.
Finland played head coach Heikki Montesen in command and finally became 17.
Finland is once again among the world's choices when Poland's MM tournament is on the speed of Saturday.
Many things have changed radically in the international balloon over 32 years.
Players' power values are approximately the same as before, but quality and skill are now more.
The average size of players has also increased.
The game's faster," think of the Parkkali.
But what happens in Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded and the burden is shared.
I expect Finland to go further from the beginning.
Then you can get tough," says Kosone.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a winning fight against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup tournament.
Let's hope we're cheating on 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go down," said Parkkali.
Lajilegenda Reino Kosonen was the second team coach in Argentina.
Jukka Savo, Mauri Leppänen, and Kari Körkkö fanned the Tunisia game.

The Finnish Christians saved the Cita dog from the mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs got into trouble on Thursday night in the mountains, Antti and Tuoma Soini offered brave help.
This weekend, Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his assistants again.
Mikkelsen told me in the public Facebook update that a Cita dog who was with him on Thursday night was hurt.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk on a steep ground.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried several times to lure it and pull it forward a little, but its feet didn't just carry, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, the help didn't come from the police, the nearby hotel, or the passers.
In the dark of the evening, the situation has already started to seem dangerous.
Fortunately, there were two travelers who were willing to help: Antti Soini and his father Tumo, Tatpere.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway on Galdhøpiggen and headed to their campplace when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells me in a message sent to Ilta-Sanom.
Soon there was also a German man with a traitor.
The Patja Citille was given a couple of manners to which the injured dog was attached.
The German man came here for a moment after us when we thought about what to do with the dog and carried a dog in his arms for a while down the slope," Soini says.
KUVA: Judge Soyni
The dog was put down with the help of the raider.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically heavy, but in difficult lands the load was slow.
In about one and a half hours, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still looking for "national heroes" on Facebook so he could thank them again.
So the soys answered him on Sunday, but it seems that the German man is still unachieved.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen will be happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all praise and honor, I will forever be grateful to them.
On Monday night, the Soinis were already on their way home.
They had been happy to hear from Mikkelsen that Cita was already feeling better!

Genetic deviation is often misdiagnosed
For years, the British woman feared death because of the wrong diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth had only a few years left because he was diagnosed with another disease.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It means a series of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, false diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, as they are known to be so little.
It is estimated that some 23,000 people in Britain suffer from a CMT disease that causes symptoms of motorism, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and perverse toes.
The disease may also cause apathy or pain, which is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms will get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he was ill with Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a really bad survival rate.
Rodgers believed that he would get into a wheelchair before he met 18 and die before he reached 30 years of age.
Today, 51-year-old mother of two children says, "When I was a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as the others.
I fell every day, and I lasted longer than anyone else.
I was never able to roll or roll with other children, and I was tempted at school because I walked and ran differently than anyone else.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he was subjected to several pendulum surgery to complete his legs. In connection with surgery, he quickly looked at his research papers, which said he was suffering from a FI disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I went to the library and wrote to the FA," he says.
When I found out about them, I was shocked and panicous.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 years and die before I filled 25, and in the meantime I'd be slowly losing my whole ability to function.
I went through this myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by 17 years old, he said that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he thought and asked his doctor about it.
The doctor just hugped me and said, "Dude, I don't think you have this disease because otherwise you'd already be in the wheelchair."
I think you're suffering considerably less from a dangerous illness.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with a CMT disease.
"When I was told what CMT disease was, I thought I was delayed," he says.
Charity CMT UK will order the CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
One hundred migrants were found in a coal truck in Macedonia.
The Macedonian authorities have found more than one hundred illegal immigrants on the train transporting coal, the country's Ministry of Interior told us on Monday.
They were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The settlers were found late on Sunday from Veles in Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were, where they came from and where they were going," said Ivo Koteski, the Home Department informant.
According to the police, migrants had paid around EUR 3 000 each to get to Greece and another EUR 800-900 to get to Serbia.
The number of illegal immigrants travels through a few million inhabitants of Macedonia on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled Syria's bloody civil war.

The municipal government showed fair sportsmen and was unanimous in its decision.
There was no meeting of the sora voices when the plot was decided," says Pauli Szerrakk, the municipal director.
The Bottks gift house has buildings on the farm... all seven pieces.
This year, apart from the king, you'll have to take them off.

The mad man was laundered by a record sum of Hernandez's club.
The Valoliga Society Hull invested a record sum of the company's share in the acquisition of Abel Hernandez, the country teamman of Uruguay.
Hernandez will exchange Hull's Italian company from Palermo with 9,5 million pounds, i.e. around EUR 12 million.
The contract's three years old.
Hernandez hit 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and went to the main Italian series.
In Uruguay's country team, he's made seven goals in 14 matches.
In the last summer's World Cup, Hernandez came from a two-game exchange to the field.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have reached in a short time, said Hull's chief coach, Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull also told me that he had acquired Senegal County Team Captain Mohammed Diamen from West Ham.
Russia's space test failed - genes sent on the road to sex died
Five small genes that have been sent to space in Russia have died, says Roscosmos of the Russian Federation.
The Gekos traveled to the Foton-M4 satellite for more than one and a half months.
Satellite returned to the country on Monday morning in Finland time.
The purpose of this experiment was to examine the ability to reproduce and use the genes in a non-weight state.
One male and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the test sounds special, it was meant to be serious.
The effects of intrepidity on the development of gene eggs, for example, are only known.
The effects on the Germans can be seen as a way of predicting the impact on the human beings in a situation similar to that of longer times, illustrated by New Statesman in July.
Roscosmos says that the time of death and cause or cause of death of the gypsies will be investigated.
According to Interfax, passengers who were baptized as "sexgers" were frozen.
The surprise also tells us that the fruit cuts that were on the same Foton-M4 rides survived the trip, and also received post-growth growth.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice Airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice Airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected to have been a recruiter of a group of jihadists in Syria.
The French authorities announced this on Sunday.
The authorities were able to track down a man after he had been tempted by money to get a 16-year-old girl to Syria.
She was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border from there.
The airline did not believe the girl’s explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alarmed the authorities.
The authorities contacted a girl’s father, who was completely unaware of the daughter’s intentions and told the authorities that the family was not related to Turkey.
According to the authorities, he is from Chechnya, but now he lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had followed the man's action before.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that radicalised young people who are attracted to Iraq or Syria will also pose a security risk for France.
The authorities estimate that, during the last conflict in France, some 800 French citizens have traveled to Syria, returned from there, or are currently planning a departure to Syria.
Knock: We have good chances of winning
The wishes of the basketball team will be in the game when Finland meets today in the second match of the World Cup in Ukraine.
If the opening box had been expected for the United States, Ukraine will once again belong to the countries where Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe that we have good chances of winning, Petter Kopone's foresight.
On Saturday, Ukraine hit the competitions in its first match of the Dominican Republic 72-62.
The team trains the NBA veteran Mike Fratello, in command of Ukraine to play aggressive basketball.
The key player in Ukraine is Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, head of the game, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-meter world champion three years ago.
Jeter threw 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter's fast guy, but yes, we've been playing against those before, and we've got to get our standard defenses fixed, Koponen said.
Hanno Mötölä promised that Finland would play better than last night's defeat in the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee you that there's a normal pack of wolves on the field, Möttöla said.
The alleged infections of Hollywood stars spread online, some confirmed realies
There are a number of naked images on the Internet, which are claimed to be presenting well-known public figures.
Among other things, actor Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a "pig campaign".
The entertainment site TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a serious violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes stolen pictures of Jennifer Lawrence is in danger.
According to TMZ, the actor Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that she is the real one.
He had taken those pictures years ago with his husband.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a terrible pain was seen for this.
I feel compassion for all those who were victims of hacking, he writes by the site.
Instead, the actor Victoria Justice says pictures of her own name as counterfeits.
There are also genuine or counterfeit downwards on the move from at least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solosta, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka painter criticises his own, "Don't work hard enough to get out of here."
The football club FC Honka is currently in the final position of the Veikkausliiga.
General Walter Reference comments after the Sunday VPS match represent a very confusing situation today.
I haven't had a goal coach in four months.
But everything needs to be adjusted," said Viitala after the struggle that ended.
Honka made a lot of mistakes in the fight, especially during the first half of the time.
This is not a bad game of defense.
Player traffic in Hong Kong has been lively this summer, and therefore defenders in front of Viitas have changed at the pace.
As a result, many young players have also received opportunities that they might not even earn.
"It's not working hard enough to get out of here sometimes," five hundred and one single player, without being named.
Honga's chief coach, Shefki Kuqi, was somewhat in agreement with Viiva.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to training and games to have fun, and you think you're a magic player, and you don't have to work, you're probably wrong about the team," Kuqi said.
I've given many young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
Kuqi also pointed out that players cannot expect immediate success when their players are constantly changing.
This season has not been twice the same composition in a row.
Especially at the head of defense, the people have changed.
That is the biggest reason why we're in this position," Kuqi said.
Honka is a serial jumbo after the VPS kill, on the level two with the last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left in the surgical league, so there is still time to avoid falling into the top.
I've never been to a team before, and I'm not gonna bet now.
We are not really going to drop this show," the goalkeeper Vitala threatened.

Then my mother and my sisters noticed the same thing, and they began to laugh, but I had to be commended for first aid.
A 20 - year - old British who took part in a super popular challenge on Tuesday was taken to a hospital where the chin was put back in place.
Video clips have become an Internet sensation and have been distributed thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The angle of sight of wolves ( even): How can fan growth be explained?
Today was a great file.
Thus said basketball player Sakari Pehkene in 1995, when Finland had played against France in the EM final tournament in the Athens Marouss Ball Hall.
He wasn't exaggerating.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the hundreds of Finns who called on 20 000 viewers, otherwise empty - control noises.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the World Cup in Finland-Ukraine?
In Bilbao, there are 80 times as many troops as a hundred Finnish fans.
The 1995 EM competitions were the target time of the Finnish basketball game.
The men swept their way to the final tournament by, among other things, winning their way to the Karsin match at the Helsinki Sports House.
That victory opened the doors to Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Mötö.
Chief coach Henrik Dettmann brought Mötöla to the final tournament team on the blizzard lines.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now it can be said that Dettmann was a long distance from being wise, even though it did not go well according to the manuscript.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
In Athens, Finns were known to have been present a little more than a hundred.
It includes journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball trainers, and some fans.
There are journalists, relatives and coachmen in Bilbao too, but there are fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown into imaginable proportions.
I'm sure no one can say the exact number of Finnish tourists.
Things have moved between 7 500 and 10,000.
There's a number between you and me. It's an inexplicable amount.
Here's a explanation for sports sociology.
In the global economy, businesses move across borders.
There is still an opportunity to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can look at how our girls and boys are successful in the world, says Professor Hannu Ikkonen.
Certainly there are Finnish people in both Spain and the volleyball World Championships in Poland who apply for life.
Joint experience.
But it doesn't explain everything.
You have to be attractive in sports, too.
I'm going to have to pick up sports as part of popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to sports fairs than to Berlin to watch art.
But without success, the masses can't move.
Let's get back to 1995.
Then head coach Dettmann challenged basketball union and players to play professionally for top sports.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed, and the team was put on the feet.
The volleyball team made the same move a little earlier.
Now we both enjoy the fruit of the work.
As Ikkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top sport, where holy trinity works: sports media sponsors.
The audience will also be interested in that.
And the media has taught us what such Carnival support is like, Mr Ikkonen reminds us.
Can ball species transfer this massive interest to their home series?
On average, the basketball is played for hundreds or a little over a thousand viewers.
The question is a good question, and it does not necessarily give an answer that would make a very good promise to the species.
The other school thinks the interest is changing.
The other is the one who doesn't want to have a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready to travel to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, there are no two interests in home country series.
There's a challenge for the followers in the middle of a sense of humor.
By Bottaksn ton - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake
Nastola rewards the layman with the Valteri Bottaks coastline.
The municipal government approved the transfer of 1.4 hectares at its meeting on Mondays unanimously.
In the future, there will be a free-time dwelling for Tonto.
In Nastola, the success of Botts has been monitored since this map.
He's being tried to be a good ambassador to market Lahti, Lahti's suburbs and Nastola.
The gift castle is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It has become part of the acquisition of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate trade.
The area has seven buildings in its depots, six of which will be depreciated at the expense of the municipality by the end of this year.
Bottas reached a formula in the 1st Belgian competition for his fourth prize winner this year.
He's on the fifth floor of the MMs.
Buttas is a native Nastolian and has lived with his child in Vilkalä.
He lives in England today, but he goes to Nastola every time he's free of formulas.
Bottas has visited upper secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design intelligence comes, but hardly the poor.
It presents and testes them at the U.S. Open (U.S. Open) tournament in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirt testers are ballmen in the field, but even the top-level amateur, Marcus Giro, likes.
According to him, a shirt will help him follow his own developments and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors have been formed on the female shirt, the information is transmitted to and from the shirt to the smartphone or board computer.
Anturs measure heart rate, breathing rhythms, stress and steps.
Before the shirt is thrown into the washing machine, the engine operating as a central unit shall be removed.
The fashion house hasn't told us exactly how much time it started selling a shirt, nor did it even point out the price, Tech Times newsed.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that invests in smart clothes.
The California Athos has sold the smart shirt and the smart hormones.
They measure the heart rate, breathing, and muscle work.
The clothes cost $100 a copy and the central unit of the thumb size they require is two hundred dollars.

A wise way to save in textbooks
The costs of university books in America exceed $1,000 for many students, so soon Matt Schroeder, starting his second year of study, found a smart way to save money.
He developed a system in which students at subsequent annual courses borrow their books against nominal compensation instead of selling the books along the way.
"My math book would normally have paid $180; I paid $10 for it for the whole semester and I knew the sandwich," says Schroeder, 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying at Coverant College in Georgia State.
Schroeder says that his book last semester would normally have paid 430 dollars.
Instead, he spent 120 bucks on them.
According to the University Board of Directors, the average student spends over $1 200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder’s idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, so they can use the book throughout the academic period and pay for it clearly less than students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
The statistics on the sector reveal that around one quarter of the books of the university bookstores last spring were rental books, says Trevor Meyer, President of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here's the simplest way to save clear money.
Net trades
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained by one third of the cost it would pay for at the campus bookstore.
The recommended price for Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" book's ninth edition is almost $290, but the book of special books for Chegg.com buys a price of $239.99.
Buy Used
The books used are a good alternative if the reader does not interfere with other notes and worn looks.
For example, the "Calculus" book can be used for Chegg.com online shopping for $93.49.
Brigham Young University's last year student Matt Casaday, 25 years, tells us that he has bought a book "Strategic Media Publications: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" using Amazon.com for only 0.42 dollars.
The new book would have paid 48 bucks.
The director of Amherst's College Without Walls University of Massachusetts, Ingrid Bracey and other academics, recommend that students ask their professors if they can use earlier editions in the course.
Sometimes the reform of the new edition is not relevant for teaching.
In this case, only a fraction of the price that should pay for the old weight can be found.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular shop for used books.
Renting
It is worth considering renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember them and do not need them when you have completed your course.
By renting you can save more than 80% of the price of the new book.
For example, renting the "Calculus" book for the whole chapter costs about $20.
Please note the rules of the leaser company, such as notes, the use and consumption of the raise threshold for subsequent payments.
Renter, be careful: If you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-mails
The purchase of e-books instead of ordinary paper can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are leased to pay for the right to use an e-book to its holder, such as Amazon.com, Chegg, Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg's deal is for about $61 a month in the e-book of "Calculus".
According to Bracey, many literature students save most because many classics today can be downloaded for free, while books in the field of science and technology can be very expensive.
The comparison of the various sellers is good, which option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, which is about to start in Pepperdine's law school, recommends that you use the ISBN number to figure out the price because it can make sure that you are looking for the right book.
Before you order the network, make sure the book's in storage, Gaul says.
He himself learned through this heel.
The delivery of the book he bought was left for four weeks, and eventually he had to get the book at full cost from the university bookstore.
The Tampere Legion Theatre meets 20 years

Almost double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
In the fires this year, nearly double the number of people killed compared to last year.
According to the media monitoring of the Finnish rescue centre (Spek), 55 people have already died in 49 different fires so far.
At the same time last year, fire deaths were 31.
The majority of the dead, 36, have been men.
Over the age of 65, there have been 11.
According to the organization's fire statistics, the worst was the year 2009, when 64 people had died in the fires by the end of August.
The majority of fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths, 21 home houses, and seven in rowing houses and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of the repeating of home fire safety.
At least the performance of all home fire alarms should be ensured by Spek.
Furthermore, it should be checked that the initial anti-pollution devices are easy to use.
There must also be an uninterrupted exit route from all premises of the home.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they can use while on their own at home.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO Summit protested at Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in Newport city center against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people met at the Cardiff City Hall, the so-called 'precise meeting'.
Stephen Fairclough followed events during the weekend and spoke with the protestors who had arrived even since Belgium.
Young people were rescued by plane from the Blue Mountains of Australia
THE teenage refugee was brought to safety after the night was stuck in the Blue Mountains of the New South Wales region of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man went to go to Govets Leap on Sunday night after noon to Blackhead.
People were concerned about young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8:00 p.m.
A search party composed of local police and assistants was sent to look for young people, and the twin was found about 23 o'clock near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and hit her head.
The police spent the night with the couple, and they were taken to safety on Monday morning.
Pats were taken to Blue Mountains, an ambulance, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk airport
Ukraine's troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, soldiers were given a warrant to retreat.
According to Ukraine, the armed forces have been very hard on the ground with Russian tanks.
According to the army representative, the counter-attack fire has been so precise that Russian soldiers are likely to be shot.
During the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the Asov Sea, outside South-East Ukraine, the Ukrainian patrol ship, which received the artillery last night, drowned in the morning, reports the border guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The Border Guard didn't have any certainty about where the first shot was made.
The Separatists told me yesterday that they shot at the ship.
According to the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
Mr Lavrov, however, insisted that Ukraine's troops immediately withdraw into positions for which they cannot fire civilians.
According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, today's negotiations between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should lead to an immediate cease-fire without conditions.
Lavrov also pointed out that Russia should respond to any new economic sanctions.
Firstly, we will protect our own interests, our economy, our social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from our partners' actions, Lavrov threatened.
The rainfalls made Malmö and Copenhagen flood.
On Sunday, the streets flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen, when the heavy rains struck South Sweden and Denmark.
The floods cut off several roads, mixed traffic, buried cars underground.
On Sunday, the authorities estimated that it might take some time to plough the flood even though the rains were predicted to cease on Monday.
Hard rains were able to surprise the Swedish authorities, and no weather warning was given in advance of the rains.
A meteorologist Ari Mustala, the Finnish Institute of Air Sciences, estimates that the region's insatiable Saderintama was very local.
The rain zone looks narrow and stable.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
The French socialist should "may be quiet and help France," says Francois Hollande's main support.
Mr Valls called deeply on the split left to show his feelings for a Socialist President in difficulties which, with the composition of the new government, was not approved by the majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay close to him," Valls said and earned the aplods.
As an easy gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave the French working week of 35 hours, despite the proposal of the new Minister for Economic Affairs, Emmanuel Macron, who has been discussing this week, that the rule should be suffocated.
Saturday, Hollande asked socialists to cooperate with the government.
The Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, however, caused the misfortune of the meeting of the socialist producers who expressed differing opinions and criticises the Socialist Party for allowing "France to give up hope for the future".
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Revolutionary Front, mocked the socialists’ constant mistletoe and said that the new government of Valls would not take longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war by calling, but so did Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the previous one could not last even summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen said to journalists.
He repeated his party's proposal to disintegrate the parliament and held his party's election victory to be certain in early elections and he himself would be prepared to lead the party.
The ruling party in France suffered a fracture in March’s gymnastics, and the extreme right was held as a list mark in the May EU elections.
According to the opinion of the Journal du Dimanche on Sundays, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break down to several competing groups before the end of the Dutch season in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political researcher at Po University, warned that the French would soon lose their patience unless the new Socialist government was able to improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly notice that the change is taking place," he warned.
Otherwise, things might get worse.
Pokka betrayed the morning of Finnish planners Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda's son-in-law failed badly in the recorded part of the program.
Last Thursday, the morning Finland program published a funny video of recordings on Thursday.
With the video, planners Kirsi Alm-Sira and Nina Rahkola as well as meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record the morning morning in the next day's broadcast, but the recording does not go exactly in the pipe.
Alm-Sira is confused in her words when she tries to say a word about budget damage, and her confusion also makes Pouda and Rahkola lose his son-in-law once and for all.
And these heroes should be allowed to draw a direct broadcast tomorrow, morning in the Facebook update of Finland.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and is both popular and distributed on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the film office, was ranked third in the Potrets series in 1972.
The image is Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
At the Fredrikin Street of Helsinki, a socialist international meeting was held in May 1971.
There were a lot of Heads of State at the meeting and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven guards went along.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we received plenty of five minutes to film.
I took this picture four feet away.
The light and the background were fine.
I just realized I did it this time.
From the look of the Meir, the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
At that time, the images of the known persons or events were carried out at the competition.
It is wonderful that other images today can also succeed, as long as they have an idea and visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's fall-off picture of the Olympics in Munich.
That's not what I sent to the competition.
Objection: Over EUR 5 million already paid by the Aarnio survey
Research into the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Department has already cost more than five million euros and has required 30-50 staff years.
This is how Jyri Rajamäki, Jyväskylä University, assessed in thesis on information technology.
Rajamäki submits that the control of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime could be significantly improved by combining IT systems in research and judicial proceedings.
According to the limit, modern technology enables multiple use of criminal engineering material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected for the investigation of crime is automatically electronic evidence satisfying the chain of evidence and, at the same time, allowing comprehensive law enforcement.
The claim will be checked on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of herbal food was forgotten on the school wall: "Calvised fish and chicken dishes"
The picture of the special information on the school’s trip to Pirkkala’s Women’s Village on the wall caused the food food in the social media, says Yle on her website.
Green foodmen!
Fish and chicken dishes belonging to the school lunch.
Only when there's meat on the list will we make a plant choice!
That's what we find on the school's wall in a forgotten 15-year-old release.
You'll be able to see the picture from here.
The picture that has spread in social media has led people to send a hearty feedback to Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Cleaning Service, notes to Yle that the flag that was forgotten on the wall is not true and should have been removed a while ago.
Apparently, before I arrived, there has sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed in due course with health care.
Every student receives a meal according to his wishes, he says to Yle.
On this day, students in Pirkkala schools are offered a choice of herbal foods only with the permission of parents and a certificate from the doctor or nurse.
The appeal is based on the solution to Yle, who may be left with food for young people, and the lack of meat or chicken can bring wonders to students’ parents.
Norwegian Cruise worth nearly $3 billion in Prestige Cruise agreement
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O., the third largest cruise company in the world, negotiates to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for three billion dollars.
As a result of the trade, Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of USD 6.8 billion, would be able to use Prestige Cruises against luxury customers and wealthy customers of Prestige Cruises as it continues to compete against Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to the source, information on the possible agreement may be published this week, but it is also possible that negotiations will not produce results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names on the public because there was no public consultation.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not reply to the comments and the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company in Miami has 13 cruise ships covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.
Its net sales increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, when net sales amounted to EUR 2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, who works so far in Miami, hangs with the names of the Oceania and Regent brand, including a total of eight cruise ships, and a route map covers the Scandinavian, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its net sales in 2013 amounted to USD 1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The 29 billion-dollar cruise industry is expected to benefit from an increase in emerging economies, such as the average Chinese and Indian classes in the coming years.
Companies compete in order to become the number one option for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises will register its first stock withdrawal in the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo owns most of the company's shares after the sale in 2007, with a value of $ 850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was established in 2000 with its associated Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to published data, Genting accounted for 28 % of the company, Apollo 20 % and the private equity company TPG Capital LP accounted for 8 % from the end of June.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise accounts for 82% of North America’s cruise capacity is reflected in the registration documents published when Prestige Cruise’s shares are issued.
The Tampere City Government will discuss this today.
Animalia wishes the city government to support the initiative strongly.
According to Salla Tuimivaara, the director of the Animalia, the University of Tampere, preparing the doctoral degree, during the dolphins in Finland and around the world, there is an urgent need to end quickly.
In recent years, fortunately, all over the world, it has become common view that farms such as dolphins in dolphins are neither animal protection nor ethically sustainable.
This view would also take place in Tampere.
The abolition of the Delfiarium is not only a matter of animal law, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination, but also notes Judge.
According to the judge, the death of Näsi dolphins is confirmed by the requirements of the delinarial lesion.
The death of I saw is a sad continuation of Sähänniemi's delfiarium's dark history.
It is time to put a point to death, close the dolphin prison, and find out how the dolphins in Tampere could be moved to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, the Judge is required.
It was not possible to experience the return of the dolphins to the original living environment, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Sähänniemi have been able to experience even more life than their unruly concrete, Tuivara hopes.
The aim of the Animal Protection Association is to prohibit the use of all wild animal species in circuses in the overall reform of the animal welfare law in preparation.
The dolphins are also included in this group.
In support of this demand, the CEO of Animalia, Judge, will take part in the debate on behalf of dolphins, which will be held today in 1.9.
The Japanese Embassy in Helsinki takes the view of the dolphin hunting in Japan.
During the hunting season, approximately 2,300 dolphins are imprisoned or brutally killed each year, either for use in dolphins or for food.
Putin asks Kiev to open negotiations with East Ukraine on a new state
On Sunday, President of Russia Vladimir Putin called for the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and to start negotiations immediately on the 'statement' of the region, Russian news sources tell us.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin did not mean that the region of eastern Ukraine controlled by the Separatists would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking people the power to defend their own rights and interests.
The request of Putin to the Kiev Government for negotiations with Russian rebels as equal negotiating partners corresponds to his obvious strategy, which he has followed since five years ago: he seeks to help separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government, in practice, to grant recently declared Novorossian independence, which will enable it to move to Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the Channel 1tv channel of state, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's efforts to take back the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, controlled by the Separatists in March and April, after the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula itself.
The Kreml and the Separatists have recently baptized the region "Novorossijaja", "New Russia" – this term reminds the days of the pre-requisite spell of the great revolutions in Russia.
According to the Russian news office in Itar-Sass, Putin said that the planned peace negotiations are 'union' as long as Ukrainian politicians take campaigns for the parliamentary elections on 26 October, and government forces are attacking civilians in the areas controlled by the Separatists.
"We must enter into extensive negotiations immediately, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and on the status of the state of South-East Ukraine, which takes into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskovi, Putin's reference to "state" relates to a broader independence, which has been debated with the leader of Kiev for months while trying to eliminate the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian Government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, says Peskov.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, says Peskov, 'because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict between Ukraine'.
The mid-term review by the representative of the Kreml, which was designed to correct Putin's comments on the 'false interpretation', stressed that the Russian government is dealing with the rebellion of the Separatists in the Eastern regions in a different way than with Crimea, in practice having its power over a region of which the majority of the population of 2 million is ethnically Russians.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to include even Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, since most of the people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and, according to pre-conflict opinions, most of the population supported the survival of Ukraine.
The independence that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give local Ukrainian governments the right to agree themselves on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would practically give the Kreml power to join the Russian Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was attached to Russia five months ago, is located in the main Russian fleet, as well as in the port areas of commercial shipping and historical coastal destinations.
In the region between Rostov and Crimea there are also mines, factories and metal smelts, which produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making powers of regions other than Ukraine in their own economy and language status.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of the Separatists of the armed forces and flames of Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his most recent demands for the Kiev Government to negotiate with Russian rebels as being equal partners after the rebels moved further last week after the invasion of Russian tanks and troops from the previously peaceful region on the coast of Azov in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that taking over the city of Novoazovsk of Separatists supported by Russia will be the beginning of a greater effort to take over the entire strategic coastal area to Crimea.
It has led to massive civilian and military personnel implementing Mariupol city strengthening. Mariupol, half a million inhabitants, is known as a port town producing steel, located between Novoazovsk and the narrow land leading to the Crimean Peninsula.
Mr Poroshenko spoke on Saturday in Brussels to the leaders of the European Union, asking for further measures to prevent Russia’s future violations in Ukraine, in the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We're about to get a point from which there's no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any direct action decisions; the leaders proposed further sanctions to enable them to be introduced if Ukraine's crisis re-emergenced under unclear circumstances.
The Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their position in the Ilovaki region after moving to the territory of two Russian military departments and 1,000 soldiers last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told journalists on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers in the Russian island in Ilovak were replaced by 10 Russian paratroopers who were imprisoned in Ukraine a week ago.

Australian posters and Gabi Grecko in the round of the naked scan
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he may have stolen from hackers his fiancée and from Hollywood's A-star Gabi Grecko's naked images.
In the entertainment world, the number of naked images of Jennifer Lawrence was published on the Internet as a result of a large, public search scandal.
Hakker has said that he has a total of 60 halves from Lawrence and other superstars, such as the top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingnes, singer Rihama, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Also, the images of the Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko, in Melbourne, are apparently stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
In the past month, Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko, said to the Confidential magazine, "This is disgusting."
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
The Greckon in New York, with comments, reports the case in the web page of "happy" and said that the victims "knowledge themselves".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with his previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots from Palmer at the topless pool.
Palmer's film shows, among other things, "Love and Honor" opponent Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck's star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning didn't comment on hacked photos yesterday.
Lawrence's representative said to the TMZ newspaper, "it's a rude violation of privacy."
The actor Seth Roge was angry with the hacker in his receipt: "The publication of images stolen does not in any way differ from the sale of a stolen product".
Publication of stolen images should not be made possible, even from a legal point of view.
Finland played almost like its home base and rose to the sensational victory of Cuba at the World Cup.
Look at the photos of the fan-huuma.
