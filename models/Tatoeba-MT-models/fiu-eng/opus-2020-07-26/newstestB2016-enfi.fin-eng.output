There was a nine-year-old boy in Tampere who ran away.
Police have had a search assignment due to a nine-year-old boy's escape trip in Tampere on Tuesday night.
The missing boy report from Western Tampere with his friend has spread in social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted and has no life and health risk.
The son's father told Ilt-Sanom half-night that he's been found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the ex-post verifications.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home, Dad told me.
Ronando, once again, rips off the paint line for Messin.
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals on the Spanish league weekend and continued his factory on the Master's league.
The fight between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo from the league of the Masters turned to the latter for at least one moment.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo was alone at the top of all-time paint statistics when he shot a visitor to the Shahtar Donetsk network with two hits on the penalty kicks and one on the game situation.
Ronaldo lifted his goal portfolio to 80, before Tuesday, the Barcelona Messiah has 77 hits on the track.
Real won the 4-0.
Juventus has been making fun of the Italian football league at Serie A since the beginning, but in the master's top D segment, it started with a 2-1 visitive victory in Manchester City.
The winning goal was made by plenty of ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack made the absence of Sergei Aguero of the knee-responsible.
Aguero, injured in a weekend's dial game, came to the field only on the last ten minutes.
Manchester’s Second Society United experienced hard work in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering from a 1-2 kill.
Luke Shaw's 20-year-old shipkeeper's visitation could only take a quarter hour.
The dangerous moving resistance of the PSV Hector Moreno hit the finish line towards the attacked ManU pack so badly that Shaw was likely to break his leg.
Shaw lay on Eindhoven's home stadium lawn for ten minutes before the medical staff went to drive him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests to the 1-0 line in 41 minutes, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno set up before the break.
In the second half of the time Luciano Narsingh was doing the PSV victory painting.
In the league of the Masters of the Landing season, Paris Saint-Germain started in block A.
The case had changed the PSG pain in Manchester United's shirt from Argentina to Angel Di Maria.
Di Maria broke through the right and pulled the ball through the back corner of Malmö's goalie Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made a 2-0 for the second half of the PSG.
PSG has been dragged into the successes of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league, is not the best possible benchmark.
The PSG star player Zlatan Ibrahimovic first met his professional career, Malmo FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career at Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team, Moscow's TsSKA, lost a B-section in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately called for a distinction - the President gave the wrong speech.
President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has given the country the same speech again in Parliament, which he held at the end of last month.
In his 25 minutes speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts about the 91-year-old Mugabe in full power of life.
The main opposition party, MDC, called on Mugabe to resign because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants rushed to say that the confusion had only taken place in Mugabe’s department and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mr Mugabe's speech discussed earlier, and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an extra summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
The President of the European Council leading the summits, Donald Tusk, assesses the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
According to Merkel, negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are at the table of the Home Affairs Ministers.
Professor admits he shot his girlfriend in an emergency call.
Professor Shannon Lamb, in an emergency call, asked a little bit of a shaking police officer to his home and told him he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was present and probably alive and probably scared. The professor told me that the contact details of the dead woman's family would be on her phone.
The police inside the house found the body of Amy Prentiss and the white paper hand-written message: "I am very sorry and I hope I could cancel my actions. I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me," said Lamb in a letter to the authorities.
There was no indication in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, had already traveled 500 kilometers to the school campus, and the police found a history professor, Ethan Schmidt, who was believed to have shot.
The police chief of Delta State University Lynn Buford noted that the university official was informed about the shooting at 10.18 in the morning.
He said that Lamb called a fatal emergency call for a while after this.
One more death event was possible today, and Lamb took his own life when the police reached him.
The next day, students and teaching staff kept their eyes on locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb’s motive.
The researchers explained the details of both locations, and Lamb’s experts told us about the man. Researchers were born with a picture of a gifted but perhaps a problemed teacher.
Students always said that they were looking forward to the professor's hours.
According to the Gautier Police Department of Prentiss' death, the professor had no history of violence or crime.
In turn, Schmidt had mentioned Lamb in a book that had given recognition to the "human people" with which he was allowed to spend academic life.
Both worked at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, which included 17 teachers, and many students attended both male courses.
However, there are indications of problems.
Lamb's praiseed student Brandon Beavers told me that the professor seemed agitated and nervous, "as if he had a problem".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him about his stress at the end of the academic year 2014-2015.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for medical leave because of some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university pay policy meant that the argument for which Lamb worked hard would not automatically guarantee him the post of assistant professor.
The university principal William LaForge told me that he was not aware of the crucifixities between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that there was something clearly wrong with Lamb.
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After the campus, the police found out what route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken his own life with a 38-caliber pistol in the back yard of the house at the Mississippi Greenville, about a mile away from his parents' home, Methel Johnson, the D.C., told us.
Lamb's car was still in the yard.
The police couldn't figure out why Lamb had gone to this house just now, but Johnson told me he thought he knew the people of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started his work as a teacher in science and education at a university with 3 500 students. The city had 12 000 inhabitants in 2009 .
He got his doctorate in education in spring.
One of Lamb’s most long - term friends described this as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston told me he met with Lamb's mutual friends when he was 15 and Lamb's 20 years old.
He was still in high school with his friends, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried to teach Hairston a guitar call for years.
"The sheep were then quite a heartbreaker.
All the girls were on him," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had been seeing each other for a while.
In an emergency speech, Lamb told me that he killed his wife, but according to any document, they were never married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in a riverbed in Gautier's little town.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentisss' former husband Shawn O'Steen told me that he was divorced from Prentiss 15 years ago. The couple had remained friends, and they had a daughter now who is 19 years old.
"He was so shocked," O'Steen said about his daughter.
"Tyryr and mom were the best friends."
O'Steen hadn't met Lamb, but she heard from Abigail that she liked music and called blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both attended the summer event three years ago.
Later, they also called together.
According to O'Steen, his daughter is writing and playing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and a part-time entertainment coordinator in the humble The Julep Room restaurant outside of Gautier, told me that he had seen Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, after Lamb called guitar and lipstick for a few audiences.
Nothing told me that something was wrong.
"Dear couple," Shaffer said.
"We were together.
We both had a good sense of humor."
"Professor Schmidt, who received his death, directed seminars for the first year and was specializing in Indians and colonial history," said Professor Don Allan Mitchell.
She was married, and she had three little children.
He studied at Emphoria State University in Kansas and was the chairman of his own brotherhood and class.
The Delta State University campus in Cleveland has 900 people to attend a memorial ceremony in candlelight. There were teaching staff, other staff, students and residents of the region.
Schmidt's wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the night event where the university choir presented the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The lesson goes on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crime situation is over.
This is a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis report to the Mississippi Cleveland.
Helpers: Associated Press reporters Emily Wagster Pettus at Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected because the police are now telling us that the emergency call was made after Schmidt was shot, and it was also checked that even though Lamb referred to Prentis as his wife, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us is not going to hire as much seasonal workers as last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products tells us that he offers his current employees and seasonal workers an opportunity to have additional hours of work.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people for sales and distribution centres across the country. In 2014, it hired 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
The interviews of applicants will start this month, and new employees will start in October to December.
Even though there are months left for the holiday period, the trade season is drawing close to a good pace, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers for the sale and the delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking with Princess Diana.
The first night of the future film, Michael J. Fox was an important moment for his career.
The first night was also of personal importance.
"We sat at the theater and waited for the royal arrival. I noticed that there was an empty place next to me. I was told that Princess Diana was coming next to me," Fox told me about the coming Back in Time document in the trailer.
"When the movie started, I realized that it was very similar to a date with Princess Wales."
Back in Time is related to the Future Films of the Return, and the Document interviews in addition to Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck, and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future film was first night 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely a time film for me," Spielberg said.
Back in Time is published in VOD and DVD format and presented in selected cinemas since October.
UN Secretary General: No military solution in Syria
The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia's enhanced military action and notes that there is no military solution to almost five years of conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again called on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to join forces and to support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At the press conference on Wednesday, Ban told me about his intention to meet five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would take place later this month at the UN General Assembly.
Ban regretted the fact that the dispersal of the Security Council, the Syrian people and regional authorities has caused a situation which is impossible to resolve.
In the context of the Syrian crisis, Ban called for five permanent Member States to show the same solidarity and unity that reached the Iran Nuclear Treaty.
8 chapters of the support polls: Is Donald Trump serious?
Trump's been trying to make me look like an empty blower.
He's also been thought to be a joke.
Some predict Trump's collapse.
The Republican circles have (for instance) all attempts to pull Trump down the gallup line.
Ten out of eleven national gallup shows Donald Trump a double number of support figures, some of which are already seriously considering what it actually tells about the possibility of a real estate molluscism.
However, the elections are only in the early stages.
It has not yet been declared that Trump is elected candidate for Republicans.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry, who was in the gallop, was given room for the rising Herman Cain, neither of which eventually won the candidate election in any state.
Trump would, for many reasons, be difficult in public elections.
External groups, such as Jeb Bush Super PAC and the economic conservative Club for Growth, have taken note of Trump's strong position and began to dig for his fall.
The following fresh gallup data indicate that the property mollusc cannot be ignored by a touchdown:
Trump's support has been a complete set-up.
Just before Trump announced that he would be a candidate in mid-June, according to the University of Monmouth, only two of the ten Republicans had a positive picture of the real estate.
By mid-July, 40% had a positive view.
At the beginning of the pension, the corresponding proportion was 52 per cent.
Now six out of ten Republicans are a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten pictures are negative.
These figures are also held in the states where elections are held first.
In last week's Quinni Market Gallup, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of the Republicans would be pleased with Trump's nomination.
Last week, 67% of Republicans said they were very happy or satisfied with Trump's possible choice as candidates.
Only two out of ten would be very dissatisfaction with Trump's condition.
Ben Carson is nearly as excited as Trump (43% would be very pleased with Carson's candidate and 40% of Trump's candidate).
Who's next the most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, whose corresponding contribution is 21 per cent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were elected candidate for the party.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temperature is problematic.
Donald Trumimpi is widely criticised for the magnitude and insulting comments. 52% of the Republican supporters consider the properties of the property as appropriate to the President of the entire country. The views are reflected in the opinion measurement of ABC News and Washington Post.
The same reading applies to Iowa, where the party meeting will be held first: According to Quinni market-gallup 52% of the Republicans consider Trump's personal features appropriate to the Chief of Defence.
However, according to ABC and Post Gallup 44 per cent consider Trump unable to function effectively, and six out of ten consider Trump's temperation incompatible with the White House.
The Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When I ask the Republicans who is most likely to be elected candidate for the party, four out of ten people believe Trump's chances, according to CNN and ORC gallup.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money in a mess for Jeb Bush.
Size: Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball in use before.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry likely to be a candidate, and only 28% of Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to think that Trump's campaign is convincing.
Even if the Republicans support another candidate, Trump will cover almost all other candidates.
Some experts consider that the divided camp is likely to benefit from Trump, when Trump’s opponents are divided into different candidates.
At the beginning of September, the opinion measurement of Monmouth University revealed that Trump and almost any other Republican candidate in the imaginary double-crossing of Trump would get a larger support group almost always.
He runs Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, and Rand Paulia, John Kasichi and Chris Christie at 33 points each.
Ted Cruz and he's on a level.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson would take a win from Trump 19 points apart from the imaginary double-crossing.
The vast majority of Trump's supporters report that they have already taken a vote.
According to the Gallup published by CBS and NYT on Tuesday, a fair half of Trump's supporters are certain of their vote.
The situation can, of course, change for a number of reasons, and at the moment, a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump's supporters have not taken a final decision.
Trump's very rival at this moment is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already selected their candidates vote twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump's view on migration.
When Donald Trump called his campaign speech two months ago, the migration of migrants from Mexico has been a hot topic in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's great-time speeches will deport important Latin American voters from the Republican forces and hinder brand renewal.
However, according to the opinion polls published on Monday, ABC News and Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans are on the same lines as Trump.
As long as the migration is in the lights, so is Donald Trump.
The dissatisfaction towards administration is at its top.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the votes of the Republicans. The favor significantly increases the fact that both have arrived outside the field.
The Republican troops prefer a fresh face, rather than a political conveyor, and according to ABC News and Washington Post's latest opinion, that was the opinion of six out of ten Republicans.
These two candidates are also grueling to Washington.
According to the opinion measurement by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Iowa, three out of four Republican Iowa are frustrated with the activities of the Republican Congress: 54% are dissatisfied and 21% are on the brink of rage."
Jeremy Corby's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
After the elections, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been looking forward to having Corbyn's first presentation.
For the first time, the Labour Party's Labouri's new vortexman Jeremy Corbyn is expected to rise to the unwinding force of David Cameron's Question Time later.
Corby's first six questions are being asked shortly after noon, and the media and the workers' representatives are following a man's eye hard.
Corby's been calling for less theater and more facts for his weekly show.
He has also stated that he can skip part of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
At the meeting, Corby's leadership will first be weighed in connection, and Corby will now be subjected to a parliamentary test following the gathering of the shadow government and the speech of the Corby's Association of Trade Unions at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
The decision of the Labour Party to silence the 75th anniversary of the British Air War in Tuesday during the national song has received criticism from several representatives of the Tory Party.
The silence of Corbyn during the national song attracted attention
During the national song, Corbyn’s representative noted Corbyn’s position in silent silence respect for the heroism of the Royal Air Forces in the Fighting Britain.
However, Mr Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight program that he would have called on the leader of the party to join the national song in spite of this monarchy.
The 10th Minister of Shadow has refused to join Corby's first state of affairs, calling for differences in economic, defence and external affairs, and less than one sixth of the party was initially in favour of the choice of Corbyn in the party.
The BBC policy correspondent, Robin Brant, considers that political differences regarding the membership of the United Kingdom and the conditions for the granting of benefits by the government have collapsed since the appointment of Corbyn by the Labour Party.
At the TUC meeting, Corbyn said that Labour intends to propose changes to remove the restrictions completely.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister for Labour and Pensions of the shadow government, said that the party's position is very clear: it only opposes the government's plans to set the limit of 23,000 to 23 000 pounds.
Corby's the fifth Labour leader David Cameron is in charge of the Tory Party over the past decade.
A new approach to politics, says Labour, who has chosen to ask Cameron 30 000 proposals from the public.
According to Corbyn, elected from the Islington North district, there are too many clashes in the survey hour, and he promises to avoid being a bit of a suffocator and to say that he concentrates instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and young people's challenges.
Corby has said that the shadow minister Angela Eagle is admiring him at interviews, for example, when Cameron is on his way abroad.
Corby has also thrown into the air the idea that others might sometimes be able to get out of the vote, and he tells us that he has discussed it with Mr Bercowin, the President of Parliament's Lower House.
After Corbyn rose to the party board in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted a doll theatre policy, which was often associated with a questionnaire, but some years later he admitted that he had failed in his efforts.
Since the Question Time on TV for the first time in 1990, it has been seen as a key measure of leadership's judgment, management and position, but according to critics, there has been a caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": homeless young photographers
Johannesburg Centre is a challenging environment for the homeless.
The group of former street children has found a way to learn and make money.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profitable imaging studio that teaches homeless young people to photograph their homes and earn at the same time.
BBC News met a young person who has completed the project among the first.

The palace will be strengthened when the UK wages rise
The china was confirmed by the rise in wages in Great Britain, and SABMiller pulled up the FTSE 100 index.
In May to July, wages rose by 2.9 per cent in the UK compared to the corresponding period last year.
The projected faster growth was fastest since 2009.
The china increased by 1% and its rate was set at 1.5505 USD, and the china was also confirmed in relation to the euro, and it was quoted at EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and reached 6.229.21 points.
The maximum increase was made by SABMller, whose course fell by 20% when the company received the initial purchase offer from AB InBev.
When the trade took place, the world would be united by two largest brewery companies and other brands under the same roof, such as Budweiser, Stella Artos, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent to the positive result of the competing Richemont Group, which focuses on luxury products.
Richemont's latest sales figures are better than forecast, and the development of sales was also leading to an increase in Burberry's key market in China.
Glencore's share rose by 5% of the miner's announced intention to collect 2.5 billion dollars in share capital as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The package and paper group Mondi's shares were the largest drop of 4.3 per cent when Goldman Sachs dropped the company's share price for sales purposes.
The JD Sports rate rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports company announced that its return before taxes would increase by 83 per cent to 46.6 million.
JD Sports: more wage expenditure could harm enlargement
According to President Peter Cowgill, the minimum wage increase in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not enough to cover the larger labour costs incurred by the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports’s enlargement plans and reduce the need for additional labour force.
Metcash laseras against the grass root campaign Ald's twilight
Metcash aims to secure its IGA shop from Ald's power in South and West Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grass root campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retail stores in South Australia and West Australia against USD 700 million invasion.
Aldi plans to open up two distribution centres and the first up to 120 shops in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA-supermarkets strengthen their relationship with local food suppliers and build IGA brands on the market in mainstream communications and social media and organise events such as Adelaide Show.
IGA stores and suppliers, as well as many brands, are involved in the campaign. For example, the ice cream factory in Dunsborough Simmo offers corn in IGA stores, and traders sell tickets to customers to South Australian football games at discount prices.
Metcashin is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the FTT will organise an annual investment strategy day.
This is a significant market because South and West Australia account for nearly 30% of the footprints of Metcash IGA sales, and in these areas coverage is higher than that of the IGA sales network in the Eastern States.
In South and West Austria, consumers are well known for their culture, and IGA traders have a significantly higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. In South Australia, the market share is 30% and 24% in Western Australia, while in eastern countries the share is only 14%.
For example, the analysts of Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first sales, and that it will eat sales from all operators, in particular from non-chain operators.
This week, Morgan Stanley's analyst, Tom Kierath, estimates that IGA dealers can sell 360 million dollars and Metcash's 250 million lottery by the end of 2016.
It is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in South and West Australia next year and will be placed in these areas for the sale of $500 million and $600 million.
Metcash's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volume can mean 13 million dollars of loss in the result before interest and taxes, Kierath says.
At the same time, Metcast loses market share in eastern states mainly for Ald and Coles, although Roy Morgan's recent investigation shows that IGA's customers are most faithful.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food sales would fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018.
Last week, the head of Magellan Financial Group's portfolio manager, Hamish Douglas, told us that in Melbourne, it was very likely that Metcash will disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to take a public position on Douglas's comments.
It is understandable that Mr Metcash's board member contacted Douglas last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18% in 2010 to 14%, and the results of Metcashi’s food business for the 1200 IGA dealer have fallen by 43% from 2012 levels.
However, the wholesale operator takes countermeasures and makes an annual harvest of over USD 150 million in order to respond to the prices of Coles and Goolworths per week for hundreds of products.
According to Metcash CEO, Ian Morrise, price revision and sales reform plans are in good shape and the company will be able to restructure its profits for the first time in 2017.
Steve Healy, chairman of the Australian tennis union, defends Thanas Kokkina
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his behavior instead of a criticism.
According to Steve Healy, the Australian tennis union president, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a secondary victim of recent attacks on Nick Kyrgyos.
The younger party named "Special K", Kokkinakis, came into an unfavorable light race when the evil boy Kyrgyos provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal ATP tournament.
Soon thereafter, the judge had twice to break up with his competitors in Cincinnati and Ryan Harrison. "Wawrinka should have given her back to Kyrgyos and my friend," Harrison said.
In the U.S., Kokkinakis was frustrated with the country's field when powerful cramps ruined his fight, and Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinak.
At the moment, the teenager is in Glasgow, where Sam Groth and Sam are fighting for the second game match behind Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup's semifinal against Britain.
"I strongly believe that Thanas has been drawn to his dispute," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the match in the open US. He's not the first player to break his mail because of frustration. I know Thanas so well that he's not proud.
However, he has endured very well, for example, the provocative use of Harrison in the open United States, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature to 19 years old, he works very hard and completes a great team. He has never had problems with other players, and he is respected among the players. He is practicing hard, is well-managed and very stable and mature young man. I think he should be assessed on the basis of his own mechanisms."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgyos from Australia's team on Friday's important round, and Healy describes the solution as a common decision for all parties, but I supported Canberra's return to the team for long-term confirmation.
"At first, we want to focus fully on the fights instead of what we have to do with Kyrgyos," Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Federerer and Murray have pointed out, a young man will have to grow up in the light of publicity. He deserves the criticism he has received of his bad mistakes. However, we will try to support him to understand the consequences of his actions. We will also try to arrange for his own peace. I believe that it is best for both the team and Nick."
European migration crisis: Hungary declare emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
The state of emergency declared Hungary shut down its southern border from Serbia on Tuesday and seized illegal immigrants, with the intention of preventing the migratory power.
There was chaos at the border when hundreds of migrants collapsed to the non-Kenken country, and the Serbian authorities react angryly.
People who fled violence had to stay on the road between national inspection posts for an indefinite period of time.
Drainage began to rise to the surface.
As the police helicopter flew in the air above the migrants, they were saying, "Open the border!" and cried insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some became protestors to the eating and drinking strike.
The Serbian Foreign Minister announced that it did not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as more arrivals from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not add damage.
The situation needs to be discussed in the coming days in Brussels and also in other countries", said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The border between Hungary and Serbia began a day later when the 28 countries’ grouping failed to develop a common migration policy in Brussels at a controversial meeting.
The Ministers agreed, however, that responsibility for the flooding of 40,000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece is common; the meeting was in the hope of reaching an agreement next month or by the end of the year on which 120 000 immigrants would be accepted from the EU Member States, including Hungary.
On Tuesday, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called the extraordinary summit together for the next week in order to discuss the continental immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not wish to take urgent action in Brussels or in neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency has developed so that authorities in two southern regions have been able to introduce more effective means, i.e. to close you and speed up legal processes in the area of asylum.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijáarto said that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence at the Romanian border to prevent the migration flows from the border, now that the border of Serbia is already ready for the fence.
The CBS News correspondent, Charlie D'Aga, reports that even prisoners participated in the tender for the finalisation of the barbed wire fences between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months Hungary has become a clear bottle neck and a transit point for migrants to the European Union, many of these migrants are refugees from Syria and elsewhere from the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that most of the people arriving are living refugees, not war refugees who have the right to seek security, and that the view of other EU countries is radically different, including Germany.
According to the new law that came into force at midnight in Hungary, it is a crime to cross or damage a four-metre barbed wire fence, built by the government on the southern border towards Serbia, which also identifies longer prisoners to convicted traffickers.
"In view of the situation of immigration, the government announces a crisis situation", the government informant Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the city of Senegal in the southern part of the country.
"We're on a tight line: illegal crossing the border is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still needs to adopt military measures that are expected next week. The suppliers of Associated Press News Office at the border for several days have seen heavy armed soldiers with their vehicles and their military dogs.
Gyorgy Bakongi, Internal Security adviser to Orban, said that the authorities have taken over 45 border crossings to attempt immediately at the border and 15 further.
The police are now in possession of the police, and they are charged with criminal offences on the basis of new laws.
The authorities are quick to fix the fence.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed down two of the seven border crossing points at the Serbian border on Tuesday, and one of the border crossing points was closed by a train hidden on a barbed wire.
Kaosos took over the main crossing point near Roske in Hungary when the Hungarians opened a small metal container to the point where people were packaged in.
About 20 fit in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants has blocked the main street that links Serbia and Hungary, and people have announced that they are in the eating and drinking laws until they are released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's management in relation to Bernie Sanders reduced by half of the national gallup
The support of former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still a two-digit race for the national presidential candidate for the democratics, but Senator Bernie Sanders has gone a long way.
Clinton's support now stands at 47% of the votes of the democratic donors (down 58%) when Sanders is second with 27% (approx. 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure to the President's competition, which is 15% of his support among the democratics.
More than five months before the elections, it is too early to tell the majority of the democracies who they are in favour of.
However, Clinton's supporters are more sure about its choice of other candidates.
After the gallup of CBS News last month, Clinton has lost support for several democratic groups, whereas new supporters have joined the Sanders camp.
Clinton still has a strong leadership role among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's support for men has fallen significantly and has only a five-percent stick in front of Sanders.
Clinton has lost control of the democratics under 50 years of age, and now he's at levels with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton's advantage in support of Sanders was two-digit among the liberals, but now Sanders has taken five percentage points of neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of the democracies report their support for Clinton if he is elected candidate of the party.
The fourth would support Clinton's small reserves, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
I do not think it is a surprise that the current supporters in Clinton would be particularly enthusiastic, even if they are elected candidate.
There are more divisions in the visions among those who are not currently in favour of Clinton. Only about a quarter would be zealously supportive of him.
48% of the democratic voters would be in favour of Clinton, and only 35% of the Republican voters would be strongly favoured by the most popular Republican candidate, Donald Trump.
When Clinton's voters are asked freely to describe why they are in favour of his candidate, the most popular justification is Clinton's proper experience (16%). Secondly, the most popular answer is that it is time to elect a female president (13%) and thirdly that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
There are also similar views and opportunities to win the actual elections.
The Vice-President still plucked his candidate, and 57% of the democratic voters would like him to go to the race, while the third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When we ask the Democrats for the second most popular candidate to be the candidate for the party, the majority of them choose Biden.
From Clinton's supporters over half Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and significantly more popular with Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the democratic candidate race, Hillary Clinton will grow his way up to Sanders. Sanders will have a 20 percentage point forward, and it will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
55% of democratic voters consider Clinton a candidate with the best chance of winning the actual elections, but the proportion has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden, second, is far from Clinton, but more and more believe Biden's chances of winning the actual elections.
The Democrats, however, regard the views on the issues of the candidates as more important.
The voters do not regard democratic candidates or potential candidates as unacceptable.
The voters consider democratic candidates or potential candidates appropriate for their characteristics.
Most of them consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden honest, reliable, and leading types.
Biden is often described as being honest, while Clinton is often considered a leader type.
Up to 30% of democratic voters do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, and Sanders is 15%. 27% cannot say whether Sanders is honest.
Democrat voters believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden's views near the electorate's own ideology.
There is no opinion about Sanders for about a quarter of all features.
When the voters are asked about the use of Hillary Clinton's private email and its own server as Minister of Foreign Affairs, the majority of democratic voters say they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation, and it has not changed their opinion of Clinton.
The Americans disagree more widely.
Half the Americans are dissatisfied with Clinton's report, and only one third is satisfied.
The people's opinions were divided in March, when the conflict had just come out.
The majority of Americans consider that the contested use of e-mail has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36% say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
The vast majority of this 36 percent, six out of ten, are Republicans.
While the voters of their own party consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these features when asking all voters' views: Clinton considers it to be honest and reliable only 32 per cent, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62 per cent of all voters do not think Clinton is honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters in the whole country must also not be treated as honest and reliable.
But both Clinton and Trump get good grades of leadership.
Of the six candidates involved in the survey, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered to be the most trusted.
Most people consider Sanders to be honest, but just as with Carson, many people don't have Sanders' opinion.
The sample of the survey is 351 voters and the error margin of the survey is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is catching up with Donald Trump's advantage in the National Support Survey.
According to CBS News and New York Times, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates missed more than half of the votes in the new survey and left the other candidates far behind.
Among the Republican voters in the whole country, Trump still has strong support. The subsidy rate has risen before Fox News's debate last month from 23% of the CBS' survey, which was published on Tuesdays, accounting for 27%.
However, Carson's support would be very high in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has strong support for all population groups.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Governor of Ohio, John Kasich, will remain far away. The support of Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin is weakest and has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
The former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio, shared the third position with 6%.
The error margin 376 of the Republican voter's sample is 6 % in the direction of the second, which was carried out in September.
According to the latest survey published last week by CNN and ORC, Carson's support is on the rise, which is worth 19% of the Republicans when Trump's support is 32%.
Also, in the latest survey by ABC News and Washington Post, Trump was clearly in charge of Carson.
In the last week's meeting, Trump fired unspeakable charges for retired neurosurgeon, but Carson asked for forgiveness after questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on Saturday when campaigning in Iowa.
Five members of the Department accused of the death of Baruch College fukse
Almost two years ago, after the death of a student in the district ritual in Pennsylvania, five people are charged with murder charges.
Baruch College (City University of New York) The members of Pi Delta Psi were brutally assaulted by members of Chun "Michael" Deng in September 2013. According to the police, the department did not deliver Deng in time to the hospital, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim’s eyes were tied, his back was placed in a hole of almost 15 kg of sand, and he had been repeatedly attacked in his attempt to reach a target that had been placed on the other side of the ice field.
Deng is first told of his complaining headache and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, the members of Pi Delta Psi didn't call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and they were said to have waited an hour before Deng was taken to the hospital.
The police chief Chris Wabner told me at the press conference that the members, however, were able to change Deng's clothes, googla his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, Chairman of the Department.
"In this stage, the members began to hide the equipment, putting the interests of the department ahead of Michael Deng's health," Wagner said.
Deng wasn't recovered, and he died the next morning.
According to the book of housing, Deng had been hit several times in the head, upper body, and traveling with a boring object.
"A lot of families have had to be shocked by the fact that at least one student in a year has died of blasphemy since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer from Deng's family.
The departments and their members must be held accountable where the authorities must take an important step.
The great jury in Monroe County presented five members of the department to be charged with the murder of a third degree.
In addition, 32 members of the department are charged with mutilation and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to be responsible not only for individuals, but also for an officially or informally accepted organisation," Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College set the department's operating ban, and the national department was dismissed from the operation of the local department.
Thus, the increase in interest rates of the US Bank (Fedin) will affect
The increase in interest rates and the growth in the stock market have become fragile, the return on securities is rising, and the economy is falling to the ground.
We know that.
On the other hand, we do not know how long it will take and how long the effects will last.
In particular with regard to the economy, we find a reference to timing in history.
The Land has arrived up to 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often raises aggressive interest rates, not always. The crucial factor is how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why the central bank officials have already been very stressed by the fact that investors are not paying attention to the start of the increase in interest rates, but about how long the normalisation of the situation takes.
Of course, there are several variables involved.
In the end, however, market operators may notice that any increase in interest rates may be excessive.
"The first rise of the Greek bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money", Julian Jessop, Capital Economics Chief global economicist told its customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual normalisation of interest rates to a rather low level, which is a scary standing shock for many.
However, that does not mean that there are no effects.
Examples of how the effects can be seen in different economic areas based on this historical trend:
As has been seen in the market for about a month already, interest-rate recovery can increase instability for some time.
When the interest is finally rising, the effect is not so dramatic.
"The trend would seem to be that the interest income of capital will be in the first step for 12-24 months, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank's analyst in the recent study of the effects of the rise in interest rates.
A sharp increase in interest rates, approximately 14 per cent, is generally seen in the 35-year-old market, relatively smooth for the next 250 days (mean increase 2.6 per cent), and after 500 days the situation will be normalised, and the average interest income after the six-month period will be 14.4 per cent," says Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management's Chief quality strategic Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the effect on shares is generally slightly more late in the cycle and interest incomes start to decrease.
The country is a fact in the economy, but the increase in interest rates would usually do so.
In this case, if the central bank meets conditions which were not in existence before and which could speed up the decline.
Particular attention is paid to the fact that gross domestic product is at its lowest ever in view of the increase in the central bank's steering interest.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 increase in the steering rate since 1950 only has been less than 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015, shows 3.6 per cent, many did not imagine it sustainable, and 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, says the regional central bank of Atlanta.
The rise in interest rates in such a sensitive economic situation may be at risk and may be asked if this situation is different, Deutsche said.
The market players have been talking about the increase in the steering interest throughout the year, and this week’s examination will turn to the meeting of the Open Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategies and economies believe that even if the Open Market Committee were to accept a lift at this meeting, the future trade appears to be only 25% likely.
"In our studies since 1950, all the lifting cycles up to this date have been in a supercycle, where even before the decline in GDP will rise very quickly after the rise is due", the report states.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst sheep in the Verroc period.
Syclik is clearly the longest one the central bank has been waiting for since the last country. The record had been 35 months, now it's been 74 months.
Fixed-income securities have also been unstable in the past of the market, and the formula is also repeated on the capital side.
"The fundamental difference is that the effect is faster in bonds than in shares when the central bank changes the course.
In the case of bonds, the return appears to be changing as soon as the first upward/down cycle starts.
At the end of the rising cycle, outputs fall immediately", Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategicists believe that the emphasis will bring long and short-term bonds closer to each other and balance the curve.
“Credit yield bonds are often better in this environment, although we are still cautious about returns,” said Schwab’s Fixed Product Securities Analyst Kathy Jones.
Fascinatingly, Jones said that the market has already adapted to the future change of central bank direction.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are a number of signs that have already been seen about the tightening of financial policy", says Jones.
Short-term interest rates are on the rise, the yield curve is on the increase, the credit risk margins have increased and volatility has increased, all of which are typical of the market in a situation where the central bank tightens policy.
In broad terms, companies that mainly operate on the US market benefit because the interest rate decreases and local products start to attract.
The outlook for debt-intensive multinational companies is weaker, as the stronger dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market and more expensive debt.
"Histeria shows that quality shares are more profitable to raise in the next three months", the Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
After the strong balance sheet, companies that had a strong balance sheet totaled five percentage points on average after the 1994, 1999 and 2004 interest rates.
Enterprises with a high return on capital, as well as low-volatility shares also improved their quality by 4 percentage points on average and by 3 percentage points on average.
"It's a big question.
Companies with a significant share of exchange rate debt lose most," Goldman said.
Consumers outside the stock market generally benefit from the strengthening of the dollar.
However, the experts disagree with how quickly the effects can be seen.
Parliamentary Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 on Classic FM copy
The conservative Andrew Bingham criticizing the radio station for over-popularisation.
According to Bingham, the channel is now difficult to separate from its commercial competitors.
The BBC Music Awards Prize is also claimed only as a copy of the British gala.
Parliamentary Mr Collins, in turn, is blaming the Voice Channel for impersonality.
According to a significant parliamentary group, BBC Radio 3 is gradually becoming a copy of the Classic FM channel.
The conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC that the radio channel of the broadcasting company is becoming too popular and that the channel is no longer different from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to change in the direction of Classic FM," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards Award will also receive criticism from Bingham:
"The BBC Music Awards held for the first time last year seem to be a copy of the British Prize Awards.
These two are examples of the fact that instead of new and different, only what is already on the market is considered," Bingham says.
The President of the BBC refused the charges and stated that BBC Radio 3 offers a commercial competitor significantly more live music and selective content.
"from Radio 3 I learned from classical music something I can't learn from other channels.
Kanava’s commitment to making live music and music is in its own category.
I also consider it important that Radio 3 has also committed itself to seeking new music and ordering new works," said the Director-General.
Earlier this year, Alan Davey, head of BBC Radio 3 said that the station must work harder to keep the public interest, since the British are more familiar with classical music.
However, Radio 3 is not the only criticism of entering the territory of the heavy commercial channels in consultation with the BBC channel, the restricted Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Mr Collins, the Parliamentary of the Tory Party, criticised The Voice's search for capabilities, which BBC bought from the Dutch producer Talpa Media, which is estimated at $22 million.
"It is not much to discuss the subject, because it is not unique or particularly different."
According to Lord Hall, the program presented by BBC1, the star stars of Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced typically to BBC.
In addition, Collins asked the company to look for a hit program for its own prize when it next launched a new series of entertainment.
Collins did not, however, agree to exclude the fact that the Voice series would continue to be ordered or that taxpayers’ money would be used for other forms of entertainment.
Growth in online trade in all time in August – perhaps due to black Friday
In the first months of 2015, the online trade increased by seven per cent.
The sales of online commerce have been recorded since 2000 and last month, growth has been the strongest of all time.
The online store was confirmed three years ago by mobile sales.
Experts believe that November’s Black Friday can control the purchase requests.
For more than ten years, the conquest of the online trade has deduced many of the UK’s shopping bags.
According to experts, there are indications that the online trade is on a more equal footing and that the new sales figures show only seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was the strongest at the time when the sales of online trade were recorded, i.e. since 2000. Last year only five per cent increase in online trade.
According to experts, there are indications that the online trade is on a more equal footing and that the new sales figures show only seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If we compare last year's growth to the 2000 figures, it is clear that growth will be balanced over time," the editor of the IMRG, Andy Mulcahy, told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, the online trade accelerated three years ago when consumers adopted mobile shopping.
"Therefore, more and more people were able to buy from the network, and for many it was possible to buy in different environments, for example, with the hand of a domestic war.
When mobileisation is more moderate, growth can be balanced."
Black Friday from America is a phenomenon considered one of the reasons for slowing growth.
According to experts, the last Friday of November will allow consumers to delay the purchase decision before the black Friday.
Last year, five times the number of online investors in comparison to normal, the websites of many traders fell.
Experts believe that the black Friday, which makes consumers fight after offers, can control purchasing desires during the rest of the time.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a fair number of each of five pounds was consumed online.
More than one third of certain products, such as television and washing machines, are purchased from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the net instead of shopping bags.
The Meka is burying the victims of assailant accidents, Bin Laden's family.
The Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funeral was held in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the large building company Saudi Binlad Group is involved in the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were injured after the crash of the crane.
The bodies were carried in high air, when Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crane that fell on Mekka's Great Smoker.
On these last journey to the cemetery of Al-Moasis, there had been a gathering of people who had been dressed in white.
The misfortune went through the sanctuary, where the fallen tower had only been intruded through the roof of the mosque before the day.
The King of Saudi Arabia calls on Bin Laden’s family company to be responsible for an accident involving 394 people.
The bodies of 29 dead victims were transported on the streets in the Mekka Suurmoker accident.
Among the fallen dead of Nosturi, Qasim Akram, from Bolton of Suur-Manchester, was the Qasim Akram, who had traveled to Mecca with his first sacred appeal.
Akram had been with his parents, who were about to start their annual break-up journey.
The Saudi Arabian authorities have promised that a break-in will take place when thousands of people are arriving in the city for holy life.
According to King Salman, the Binlad Group should not have left a crane boom up when the crane was not used.
According to the Arabic press release, Binlad Group is involved in the accident.
However, according to the English bulletin, the Group's management is prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the yard of the Great Smurf. Thousands of Muslims are heading towards the hair-stamping challenge later this month.
The Binlad Group has not published a notice of non-compliance and the Group’s representatives have not been set up for this opinion.
The King also accused the group that it had failed to comply with up-to-date safety regulations and cooperated with meteorological experts.
The ten cranes are surrounded by Mekka's Big Mosquija as part of the construction project of Binlad Group.
For decades, Bin Laden’s family has had close contacts with Saudi Arabia’s ruler family, and Bin Ladeni is responsible for several major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaida Osama bin Laden was a apostate boy whose family had abandoned in the 1990s.
Only a few days before the holy Mecca, who every capable Muslim is obliged to do at least once during his life, was the instigation of the nostril.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered the payment of a million dollars (i.e. EUR 250 000) for the victims' relatives and those permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of the compensation amount.
According to the B&Q bomb, there is a cheap Eastern European workforce behind the phenomenon.
The British hire home audiences more often, says Veronique Laury.
Advantages have been increased by skilled workers from Eastern Europe who work as professionals.
More than 200 new Screwfix shops for workers will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes the 60 B&Q store around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, Main correspondent, Daily Mail
Britts are said to move home's hammering and painting work to those from Eastern Europe.
Vasurizing and painting skills seem to be scarce today.
The British are now increasingly employing domestic public officials to carry out home nickeling work, says the director of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is a new CEO in Kingfisher, who owns the home repair chain. According to Laury, the phenomenon is based on professional workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at the most cost.
As a result, Kingfisher intends to open 200 new Screwfix shops for traders, while 60 B&Q shops are closed.
Laury needs more female work at B&Q stores, because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store make a woman.
At present, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, there is reason to pay attention to demographic trends, as more and more women living alone today also tend to improve their homes.
"The staff of our salesmen are still mostly men," says Laury.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of the decision to buy products is made by a woman.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of five women who are behind companies in the British FTSE 100 index, and he has also reorganised the corporate management group so that men and women leaders are balanced.
Kingfisher is almost the only one in quality, as 50% of its staff are women, including CEO and financial director.
"This was a conscious decision, and diversity is an important topic for us," Laury told us.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women in the management team."
There is a drop in the operating profit and sales figures of Kingfisher for six months, even though the company was working hard after the end of sales.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new shops.
The three-year government decided to resort to forceful legislation in order to save the country's economy.
After all, the effects were quite rapid.
The sharp head of SAK’s and other employees’ center organisations began to force the country to stand on Friday because of the widespread demonstration of workers.
A lot of people think that there is also reason at that time.
Let's see if it's worth a strike while it's going to go bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50,000 people on the Internet have already reported that they are not going to take part in the demonstration but go to work.
In old times of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but openly declaring a criminal would have been a small human political suicide.
A few tens of thousands of trade unions do not have a long time to protest, but it gives a reason for thinking.
The position of the trade union is no longer as obvious as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, government brutal solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years, when things have seemed to be rolling with their own weight, then there is finally a point in the alliances, i.e. the rights of the employee to defend, visibly and properly.
This is how the government may want to take the role of ay movement, when membership in the trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary than ever.
Let us be of no opinion about the activities of organisations, so it is a waste of time that Friday's demonstration of mind might somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has already fallen for 31 months.
Gross domestic product continues to decline, with unemployment rising.
These are the things that you would think would force everyone's head.
Hard savings for University of Lappeenland: Objective 8.5 million savings, reduction of personnel by 130
The technical university of Lappeenland begins a savings period with the aim of obtaining a total cost of EUR 8,5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will launch the entire staff-related negotiations with a savings target of 6.5 million annually.
In practice, it means reducing about 130 employees.
In addition, two million will be spent on other activities.
In the light of the Yt negotiations, the 2016 budget is expected to be 8,5 million deficits.
It is also affected by the government’s grant operations.
In this financial year, the university will make some 2.6 million deficit results.
The expenditure will increase slightly next year, but funding from the same Ministry will be reduced by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The overall budget of the University is around EUR 85 million, so the saving target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive teaching and research cuts and the reduction of company funding on our university is very important, says Principal Anneli Pauli in the University's release.
Before the summer, the impact of cuts was even more moderate, but the reduction in additional funding appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with the trustees will be launched next week on Tuesday and will last for six weeks.
Yle: Happy wants to see Finnish railways
The owner of Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in going along with Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the UK's largest railway companies, says Souter.
Rail transport should be gradually opening up to competition.
The first is close traffic in the capital region in 2017-2018.
After nearby traffic, long-distance traffic is in place.
Souter tells me he's already approaching the Ministry of Transport.
According to Ylen, the Ministry of Transport welcomes the plans for Onnibus.
Other international companies have also reported their interest in rail transport at least in Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
With the US Central Bank the time of the interest rate decision
The whole world will be followed by a meeting of the United States Central Bank Fed on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on the possible increase in interest rates for almost a decade.
A fair half of the economists, who still believed that the central bank would raise interest rates last week, now attract the central bank to maintain interest rates at current 0-0.25%, which is reflected in the survey conducted by 80 economic scientists in Reuters.
"There is a historical situation in the case, as the central bank has been holding the interest on zero already for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a significant central bank can raise interest rates from zero levels and thus initiate normalisation of interest rates", said Peterson Institute for International Economics' senior researcher Angel Ubide.
The state of the US economy has been relatively good, and recovery has brought billions of dollars in the balance sheet and has accelerated little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the global situation, which is not just as rose.
It has called for a change in the market, but also references to the opposite can be found.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday 20:00 in Central Europe.
Delta State University shooter left an apology note.
After his girlfriend was shot at the Mississippi Monday morning — before the colleague was shot later on the same day — Shannon Lamb wrote a message in which he asked for his first murder and hoped he could cancel it, the authorities told him on Tuesday.
At the Mississippi Gautier, Delta State University, Lamb, teaching on highways and social sciences, called the emergency number about 10 a.m.
Monday, he told me he shot a man.
Lamb called the police at his home.
"I shot my wife last night," Lamb told me, and she also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house, which is no harm to anyone but who is probably scared.
The police asked the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't say a motive to shoot.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, the body and the text written by Lamb, which read as follows: "I am very sorry and I hope I could cancel my actions.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman that ever loved me."
After I wrote a message, Lamb drove 500 miles away to Delta State University, where he killed Professor Ethan Schmidt of history before taking his own life late on Monday when the police reached him.
The university principal William LaForge told me that he was not aware of the crucifixities between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that there was something clearly wrong with Lamb.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb assumed that Prentiss was in a romantic relationship with Schmidt, but the authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence of the triodrama.
For seven years, Shawn O'Ste, who was married to Prentiss, described his former wife as a human being.
15 years ago, the couple had resigned but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's upset.
According to the man, the daughter and mother were the best friends.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of Prentiss, Lindsay Knowles, told me that Prentiss worked online from home to home.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called relatives during Monday and told them that he wasn't going to jail.
When the police reached Lamb Highway 1, near Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped the car, fled his foot, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to the CV on the University's website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Folding Stars
The past few years have been hard for an actor (on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001 he fought against leukaemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also been fighting drugs, and in 2008, he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything that's happened has really required its taxes.
Manchester United Luke Shaw page months for two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg broke in the Manchester United Master's league against the PSV Eindhoven.
The defender has to be embarrassed to stay on the side for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the field this season.
The 20-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV defence zone in the bad charge of Hector Moreno, when the game was under way for fifteen minutes.
Shaw got first aid on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures on his leg, and he's in hospital," Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be moved tomorrow or tomorrow for surgery in Manchester.
At the age of 18, a young man associated with Manchester United has experienced a hard time and is now injured after his wonderful matches.
In the dressing closet, Shaw was given oxygen.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but when the leg breaks into two places, he's on the side for half a month and he's no longer playing in the block.
I hope he's still able to play this season.
Moreno had little effect on the situation when the red card was not followed by a penalty.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
According to Van Gala, the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You can decide for yourself, but I think it was worth the penalty and the red card.
It was a two-legged guarantee."
Shaw said, "Thank you for all your messages, and I said, "I can't tell you how frustrated I am.
Add to: Manchester United Luke Shaw page in the PSV game
The British defender has a special reason to recover at the European Championships in France in June.
"There is a very bad injury in the case," said PSV coach.
"In such a situation of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
The goal of the players is never to harm the opponent."
Moreno broke his leg when playing the Alankolands of Van Galal in the Mexican lines only during the 2014 World Championship.
"He is very sorry, for he was not intended to harm the opponent. It is a shame to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation.
I only saw a ball that was going in the other direction, so it seemed that he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke's coat."
"I know how it feels, and I know how difficult this can be," Moreno said to the SBS6 channel.
"It feels really bad, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Sming.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Each parent will find that the child learns his favorite book almost from outside.
Except to see David Cameron.
When the children’s holiday organization asked Cameron to appoint his favorite children’s books, the Prime Minister elected Lorax, Dr. Seuss, published in 1971, to teach the environment story.
In the text published on SuperCamp's website, Cameron writes that the selection was difficult. "The story is fun, touching and creative, and it has a strong message. I am happy to read it to my children because there is always a picture or message that we've never noticed before."
Sounds good, except that the next item where Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to complement the short initial text.
"In the city of Tarville, from which the right trees and plants have disappeared and even the air is a commodity, the boy named Ted, who wants to reach the heart of his dream girl Audrey by implementing this greatest dream: to see the right tree, the text tells us. In 1991 the version of Dr. Seuss, or Theodor Seuss Geisel, had no object of love.
Unless this is suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly compatible with the Lorax plotting clause on the Internet Movie Database. It begins as follows: "In the city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is commercial, the boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey."
Cameron is known as active parents, so it seems unlikely that the book's plot would be so strange to him. Ahne Kerskanen will destroy the wood and make them Tarksksa nobility despite Lorax's opposition. Lorax is a small and thick, fissile creature that protects the forests.
It is likely that a minor pr's task, such as this, has been entrusted with the task of an assistant, apparently someone who, as a child, has not read Lorax 20 times in the tube.
The Prime Minister said that the text is probably from Cameron's electoral office.
SuperCamps did not comment more closely, but confirmed that the text was in Cameron's staff's handwriting.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being away from the English team, but it's still hard.
Pakistan's encounter in the United Arab Emirates is a hard task, but once we see a team selected for the tour of England, we are not expected to repeat the loss of the last 3-0 series of tests.
I wouldn't shut down the opportunity for a guest victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be more inexperienced than a team three years ago, but the team has good players and the attitude of the team is strong – they have no bad experiences in 2012, only young positives.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a tour eater, and Adil Rashid, although he has no test-level experience, represents an attack option.
Subject: Adam Lyth dropped from the British Test Team and replaced by Alex Hales
Clearly, the decision to leave Adam Lyth away is hard for me to understand his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven tests have been in two challenging circumstances against good attack, and simple and cruel truth is that critics are criticised according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I have said before, players are the best voters.
A few 50-point matches would have been held by Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire for more runaways.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, also commended his attitude when he didn't do as well as he could, which didn't surprise me.
The question of how long the Test-Funner gets the chance to make a difference is difficult.
Lyth received seven matches — like his predecessor Sam Robson — while Nick Compton received nine.
Only Compton got a chance at both home and guest games.
The only thing to complain is perhaps that England used Jonathan Trott first in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in the top condition – but this past opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming to the team, and he's a hitter, and I appreciate it.
He's a critical player of an unknown factor, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season, when he did 236 points against us in the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moeen's kick-off with Cook to get an extra tourer into the game while four quick-frozens are being held, and I'm not against the idea.
I don't see any obstacle to the fact that the top eater could be hitting here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great critic.
Moeen may not have had much time in his local team at Worcestershire, but he has been a team's three-player, and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test match as the first replacement player before you could start in 2001.
He did three hundred points right away, and there was no return.
Zafar Ansari is in the team as a backup collector, and on the basis of what I've seen of him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can view his statistics – on average 31 points as a hitter and 35 feeders – and this can be a search engine, but very many tourers have not shown themselves ready, and the voters decided to take a young player.
He'll learn a lot during this fight trip.
The playing team outside England seems to have made a couple of intelligent choices for their training staff.
The name of Sri Lanka's hitter, Mkärjawardenen, may be a passer for Test matches.
This is one of the most sensitive men of the species who brings a lot of experience, because he has played under all kinds of circumstances and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the part of the white ball of the game trip and brings both energy and mercy.
In my opinion, he has always been influenced by the appropriate international criticism, whether he is a player or a coach, and, like Mahelia, he has the intelligence to use.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, can be a spray.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one day's fights, Root received a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coaching and electors do not set the match schedule.
And we must bear in mind that, like the players, their jobs depend on the results.
These decisions will never be taken without consideration.
Brexiti Camp can win if the economy is at a bad time in 2017
David Cameron's half-way renegotiation strategy for Britain to stay in the EU is in the deeper swamp every day, even without the desire to please Jeremy "yes or no" Corbynia's choice of the Labour Party's leadership or the TuC's blatantly mocking Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farags.
The European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is going to be, although not everyone is doing its own thing, some Member States are tired of their own agenda, which includes concessions that cause disagreement and harmful changes to the Treaty, which they do not really want.
In Brighton, the TUC annual Congress concluded that they would not like to see social security in the EU either.
We could call it Dave and George a selfie agent.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor will hang out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-valued people, return home and tell them that they have acquired allies for reforms.
Everything has to do with me.
My European friend, who wants to have a space-oriented Britain inside the EU tent. "Don't leave us alone with France", Berlin says and suggests that more and more short-looking ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point that we don't care whether to stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the prudent Federal Chancellor of Germany is a ally, but he has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the post before it is ruined, as it has been for those who have been too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France has a re-election or successor’s choice in 2017.
His power is sinking, too.
Poland will soon be able to have a nationalist judicial government, a left-wing government in Spain.
It's hard to imagine helping them out with selfie Brits who could use their energy better to try to stop Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they don't want it, because most of them have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers may deliberately plan to throw useless comments on the British National Party style in the UK 2017 popular campaign to bring Brexit to the process, my friend suggests.
The renegotiations were the subject of the new negotiations. "The British left nothing in the hands of the renegotiation negotiations."
The Europeans know how the British press is preying and how the EU sceptical oligarchy is, just as Tony Benn's referendum in 1975, with a result of 2:1 joining the EU in 1973.
Someone may have a distant memory of Boris Johnson, a knife-like euro-opportunist known as "Our direct EU banana correspondent" in Brussels at the beginning of the 1990s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
These include taxes, telephone hacking and visual-room costumes, which own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but then she realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you're gonna have to throw bananas into a puzzle so that the gorilla doesn't eat you both for lunch and dinner.
Miliband was a blaririte of Blair in opposition to the referendum, and Blair admitted to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in referendum 2005, Blair was able to get out of hand.
The press never forgave him, either.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who killed me in the back of Westminster on Monday, told him he had no time to waste on me, could be a danger of introducing Neil Kinnock's media robotic strategy in the '80s.
It may take some time, but Corbyn has to develop a coherent strategy for dating with the media, not with me, but Andrew Marrin, who was sitting on the BBC for Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call building.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most people outside Ukip and Tory are likely to respond to this.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Benniti" Benn told me on radio and television this week when his inside patrol boy tried not to admit that it was a bad call from Corby to appoint a fugitive John McDonald as Minister of Shadow Finance.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old father had trouble on television not to go too far and without losing his place in the lower room.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Mr Benn said he was opposed to staying in the EU 'in all circumstances'. Mr McDonald did not say so to his colleagues and members of the lower room in the private meeting on Monday night.
He wanted Corby to care about how much I admire the picture, we must remember that he even touched me. The message is important in the 24/7 period, especially in social media abuse, where paranoia and fraud are being made.
Cameron does not need to give EU-wide passports to support Labour in the referendum, as McDonald has said.
That's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
McDonald's and Corbyn's budget for EU membership is in line with the island economy and the past against capitalism, and discussions are no longer just part of a limited region of left-wing dissidents, to whom the idea of combining similarity is a key doctrine in doctrinal chaoss.
There has also been an Equivocation with regard to NATO, and Tom Watson is astounded that Corby was not campaigning for the departure, and foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify it to their own countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital?
The United States has already been quite disappointed by the terrible military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even the cuts in the days of the Tory Government, which I was reminded of on Monday in connection with the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise the British Authority’s opinions on electricity subsidies
According to researchers, the state-funded installation’s claims that burning electricity cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking were created at a meeting with 12 participants in the tobacco industry.
Experts criticise the evidence presented in the report by the Public Health England (PHE) of the Public Health Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal.
The PHE described its report published last month as "reversible and comprehensive review of the results".
However, several researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and raised the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
The Lancet Medical Journal concluded last month that the "sufficient fiduciary foundation", based on the main conclusion of the PHE, was taken into account.
In addition, two researchers have considered whether the claims were based on "a cock or a sand".
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine European Public Health Professor Martin McKee and Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool Simon Capewell have stated: "The basic principle of public health is that the principles of action are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKeen and Capewell, the general public assumes that the claim made by PHE that "the current best estimate of electricity cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of the results.
The claim is to collect one of the 12 meetings, which was called upon to set up a multi-criteria definition analysis (MCDA) model. The model wanted to harmonise the views of the participants on the harm of nicotine products.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the meeting sponsors included EuroSwiss Health, which, according to sources, has been financed by British American Tobacco (BAT).
In addition, in the report on sustainability, the Executive Director expressed support for the activities of the BAT in line with public health.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting was granted funding from the electricity supply manufacturer, but this participant did not grant the previously claimed funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The selection criteria for the panel configuration have not been explained, but there are several well-known producers of electronic cigarettes, some of which grant their involvement as an industrial donor.
However, some participants are not familiar with their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE tobacco company.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the Group's study report shows that there is no undisputed evidence of the harmfulness of products with regard to the vast majority of products and their criteria.
However, links or shortcomings are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, there is so far no evidence that electronic cigarettes can contribute to smoking by children or non-smokers.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, the head of health and well-being of the PHE, the arguments have previously been answered.
According to Fenton, electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every other person who smokes through life dies because of tobacco addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of electric cigarettes are lower than the risks of conventional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be examined more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens of what evidence shows and what it shows, particularly in a situation where the relative risks of traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the United Kingdom, nearly 80,000 deaths in smoking are reported annually and smoking is caused by a cost of 2 billion pounds per year for public health care.
Responsible action requires that we clearly present the current evidence that electronic cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but the damage caused by them is part of the damage caused by traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4.
Luke Johnson, led by Channel 4, has stated that the BBC should stop sending certain programs. These include EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hands on the lottery, such as the soap show Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the licence fee should only be used for the creation of programmes other television stations do not.
He also criticised BBC's presentation of less public programmes at the same time as the large audience programmes of competitors, as well as the BBC4 channel.
After the BBC Director General Tony Hall announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that he was trying to get Channel 4 to cooperate with BBC for six years.
"I do not agree with the idea that BBC will buy formats and send programmes that would clearly belong to some competing channel software," Johnson told the Communication Committee of the Upper House of Parliament, which explained the future of BBC.
If BBC wants to keep a public service fee, which I think is not necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should reduce its supply to at least programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
BBC sends The Voice to the best viewing time, because it wants maximum support in the future.
If no other channel cares about the program, it's obviously ridiculous nonsense.
"I do not understand why the progressive tax should finance programmes that could be financed without subsidies," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders second, even though it is its own production.
Many canals would give their right hand with it.
I don't understand how this serves the service of the broadcasting company.
I don't think these would be losses to BBC."
Johnson is a serialist who was at Channel 4 in 2004-2010. He thinks BBC has good ratings because the company is working with ambitious people and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on BBC's most popular series are similar to that of the former Sky-pomon Tony Ball, which suggested in MacTaggart's lecture in 2003 that BBC sell out series such as EastEnders.
According to Johnson, programmes for BBC's niche General are shown on the BBC4 channel, where audiences are often not able to measure, but the programs meet their purpose. "The BBC can say, in defending its hypocrisy, on the misses of four billion pounds of broadcasts, they did make special programmes that no one saw."
"BBC presents them as times when no one ever sees them."
From the public service charges, Johnson said: "I will make you look for someone else in that sense as an old-fashioned system, who will benefit from the best.
Everyone, of course, thinks that 150 pounds a year is affordable, but people to whom it is a big sum, especially if BBC is not exactly looking at."
David Elstein, former Director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, who also told his views in committee on Tuesday, said that BBC should exchange its ancient mission with new "information, learning and entertaining".
According to Elstein, the current provision of BBC is hardly a teaching program – 1 percent on television and 0.1% on radio, and it adds that BBC should learn from Australian and Canadian broadcasting companies and begin its mission to new faith: "information, lighting and entertain".
On the cooperation issue, Elstein suggests that BBC could increase transmissions, for example, to events such as the Proms festival, which was sent last year to only a fraction of the concerts. "BBC should also join alliansse commercial channels, so that the entire offer is also available online", he continues.
The brain cells can be controlled with sound waves using sonogenics.
The video shows how the shuttle mat changes in direction when applied to the ultrasound.
Researchers have raised worms whose nervous system has been genetically altered, so that worms can be controlled by ultrasound.
Small shuttles change their direction by targeting them with an ultrasound with a frequency above the human ear ear hearing area.
Sound waves activate motion nerve cells that have been genetically modified in such a way that they have a transport film that reacts to ultrasound.
Add on: Researchers monitor brain activity by light
According to researchers, the worms were able to demonstrate the efficacy of a new sociogenic method (dubbed sonogenetics).
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher in the Salk in La Jolla, California, told Guardian that one day the method could replace deep-brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson’s disease symptoms, where the brain is stimulated by electroimulses.
Chalasani noticed that the worms are starting to react when they are placed in a liquid with microscopic small bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the doves strengthen ultrasonic waves that advance into the worms.
Increased ultrasound waves affect the TRP4 ion channels, which are part of the worm cell membranes.
According to the article in Nature Communications, sound waves open these ion channels and activate the cells they attach to.
In order to guide the shuttles in ultrasonic Chalasan transformed the worms genetically in such a way that I knew about the nerves that led them to the movement appeared in the TRP4 channels.
When ultrasonics were channeled to converted worms, the microspheres confirmed the sound waves and moved to worms, leaving the signal in the nerve cell.
The method reminds a little of optogenetics, which is a remodeling tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells using light.
According to Chalasan, sociogenics, however, have certain advantages compared to optogenetics.
The light is directed to the brain under investigation using light fibres. Low-speed ultrasounds, instead, pass the cell easily, so ultrasonic can be channelled into the brain through the skull.
"We believe that through gene therapy and viral treatment, human nerve cells can be instantaneously exposed to ultrasound signals in a clinical environment in certain neurological treatments," Chalasan said.
According to the investigator, the method could also be used in muscle cells and in cells producing insulin.
Unlawless torture devices — at your door!
The commercials are a disgrace to the British arms trade.
Look at Amnesty International's anti-armed media.
Charmous killer missiles!
The ankles breaking the legs!
Rice bombs!
Remote detectors that cause insatiable pain but do not leave any trace!
The happy sound and drawings clearly reveal that this advertisement of the world's largest weapons fair is parodia. The video is produced by Amnesty International, and its purpose is to highlight the efforts of the British government to sell weapons to repressional DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) at the ExCel Fair Center in London, Docklands.
Add to: DSEI weapons fairs: authoritarian regimes arriving in London
There are also posters on bus stops and subways that require another flash.
"Very notice: Are you moving on the subway 15–18.9.?" The notice reminds us of the London metro announcements. The metro line is located on the other side of the tank.
"In September, a number of arms dealers arrive in Docklands. Customers are asked for help so that weapons fairs can be terminated."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists who worked at the Banksyn Disney Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters all over London with a six-pack of "broadcasting kits", which, according to the claim, is about one-third of the advertising posters for bus stops in the world.
Transport for London is not famous for vandalism.
One of the Special Patrol Group's triple pranks.
According to the curator of Cruel Designs and Professor Gavin Grindon of the University of Essex, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political work to the public outside the gallerys.
Artists have noticed that social influence through art requires art to be brought to the real world, and many move to work with Protestant activists.
Another of the anti-arms trade posters greets public transport users in the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed via Facebook more than 100,000 times a day. It has been designed without compensation for the advertising office VCCP, and both the graphic designer and times have also done their work without compensation.
The artistic leader of VCCP Matt Lever rang the absence of the Massumino and the empty point of ExCeL's event calendar, and he said, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to get a more realistic, dazzling corporate video, but bright colors and animation are a better way of raising attention."
"They've done a great job and helped us to raise the masses that carry out illegal torture trade," says Amnestyn Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded at our own door."
However, perhaps the most creative anti-missiles are displayed at the exhibition premises in ExCeL, where the exhibitors use great circular expressions of their trade goods.
In his press release, Saab announced that the U.S. Army ordered "to be transferred to AT4CS RS."
The product includes "a special-shaped battlehead that is effectively intruding directly to the target".
Doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for students living in student housing
I moved to a student apartment 11 years ago. I was innocent 19 years old and still believed in barettes and moral relativisms.
The main teachings I can sum up in eight simple rules.
The migration of the residential area is the least challenging experience and the worst shocking experience.
In this situation, you start to be easily hunting: you tell everyone where you are, did you hold an interim year and why you like Corbyn and why you don't hate him or love Marmite, because it's nothing but sweaty, hacky, I'm in my room.
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others breathe: show interest and ask other questions.
The interview will guide the discussion and help you find people you like and people you wouldn't even talk to when your rappers were in the manifests and these people would be sharing fire extinguishers.
Give the others room.
My own rooms often serve as drinks, cinematographs and general residence rooms, but your own room is also a place where you dress, starting with underwear.
Add on this subject: Don't even think you're combining dating and university studies
For Introverte, the university is a tough place.
The private room should be a place to calm down. However, many flats make up a social culture, which moves from room to room, and makes life-long friendships.
Such culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return.
In this environment, it is not possible to say, "I love you and want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can recharge the energy I used to date with you."
Try to find out if any of your students are exhausted from social contact. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a texter instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
In my own student dorm, there was a guy who said that the door that was locked meant that he was welcome in.
He saw all kinds of things.
Make friends with the bakery.
You start your studies properly when the bakery is in, so if you're going to have a brow and knock on someone's door, you don't look like a 50-story, a little weird case: "Hello to the neighborhood, I'm resting for you something small.
Homemade treats are a great way to make new friends.
Your student friend will have to talk to you, and the surprise of the taste is that they will have a positive picture of you.
This, of course, requires reasonable bakery from you.
If you serve bad flour, sugar and fat cookers, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Cooking is also a general malfunction in student housing.
Taking another chicken, of course, is stealing, but can you drop your tea off some other milk can?
Always make sure you get the milk from the owner.
You'll probably get a permit, even if you can borrow milk from the owner of your duke.
I understand it very well that it is annoying if someone is suffocating something from you, but try to take care of the situation as adult as possible – unlike my own student friend, who put the detergent on his milk for punishment on milk thieves.
She's in jail now.
Don't make noise when everyone else tries to sleep or get drunk.
Not only because it's polite, but also worth remembering that anyone who digs another hole...
In my apartment, a girl asked the neighbor of the next room to adjust the music to a smaller one, for three o’clock in the morning, and she had a exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When I finally got quiet in the next room, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours, and she left the exam for three hours, left the music in her room, and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future mate had to move to the same flat?
And wouldn't it be strange if you first thought that your fellow students would be your future spouse, would you start dating, resign and have to see him every day and lose your common friends the right to meet him?
I mean, the heart wants what it wants, and if a college partner is definitely not the only one, try to control it.
If you notice, in a moment, that someone has forgotten their keys to a room whose door has not been locked, the limit of fuck and bullying is more dazzling than you might think.
It's a good joke, but it's the kind of guy that's gonna get better in a second.
Hideing some objects may be valuable and fun instruction, but no one's got to mess with the toothpaste and the sampoola.
The door of the other room can be locked and dropped on the water glass, which is placed in the freezer, but do not place any items on the ceiling on the blue star a few times more.
A racist strike at the place of residence of foreign students in Kite - The house as reception center was stunned in Salo
On Saturday morning a racist strike was taken at the foreign students' headquarters in Kite, North Karelia.
Unlike the police earlier, this is not the accommodation facilities of minors' asylum seekers, but the sleep facilities of foreign students in Finland, says Heidi Luukäinen, a teacher at the Estonian National School of Evankelinen.
The windows and walls of the National School's accommodation facilities were stunned by racist signs, such as hakaristas, and a metal object had been thrown through one of the accommodation windows, says the police in Eastern Finland.
According to the Luukkainen, responsible for social security training at the National School, there were an estimated ten people at the time of the attack.
"There was a weekend and adult people are free to move, and some could have been elsewhere," Luukinen says.
People from 12 different nationalities are housed at the National School.
They are students who have already been in Finland for some time, as well as those who have recently arrived for asylum.
All the people in the dirty building have a set of statuss.
Some study at an adult basic school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," Luukkainen explains.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time for a foreign country that has been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to the figure, students were given an information meeting on Monday, including the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to go away.
We've had tens of years of foreign students, and this is the first time that something like this happens," Luukinen says.
According to a bunch of people, the mess's already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men were suspected of being in the factory, and they had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think that this is the end of the youth weekend when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," Luukukinen says.
There is also a hospital in Salo, where a reception centre has been set up.
The case happened last week.
He told me about it on his MTV website on Tuesday night.
The hospital wall had been drawn by a hammer and written in English "You are not welcome".
A criminal record has been made to the police.
Amendment 15.9. at 16.02 Revised police information on the age and status of people living in the building.
The state will stop Y-junna's Karja, the passengers in their throats, "the old idiots."
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepor's Karjaa ceases to travel in March.
The new train was agitated by passengers on the early nights of the train at Helsinki main railway station.
In particular, the downside is hitting on the civilians, said Torbjörn Bengtström, in the municipality.
It's just idiotic, because the number of inhabitants is growing all the time and people who work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be closed to anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says that HSTV's interview video is coming with a tractor to the capital.
There are also train changes elsewhere in the Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main track are combined into a new R line.
The station of Purola in Järvenää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula is out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR published information on the routes that the Ministry will purchase train services during the next contract period.
The contract period will change at the turn of the year and the rest of the routes will be in the whole country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in autumn, will later be adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
The Siuntio, Bengtström, considers that the state train course is short-sighted.
We make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeated in a very systematic way.
Then we'll turn on the roof.
The Y train is also used by non-Raasporians and civilists because it is fast and pass several stations.
In Espoo Annina Pöyryä felt the fate of travelers further away from the city area on the train.
"It's very bad for those who have to plan their journey again," he said in hurting the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
There must be a new train connection to the beach track, which will replace Y-jun in the area of HSL, which will take you to Kirkkonum.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. practically for municipalities and their taxpayers.
"We are now going to find out different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs carefully.
Rihtniemi tells us that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million dollars a year for the Y train, the Ministry has certainly much more for this.
The R-line on the main track leaves two positions between them.
Instead, the number of trains in Ainola and Saunakallio doubles.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease across the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuru and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinajoki.
The Piksämäki-Joensu route is shortened into the route of Pieksämäki-Varkus.
The trains are reduced on the routes of Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips are carried out in the current shifts, while the total number of trips purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring the state's annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote in the Book of Capital Time: "Marxin is worthy of study"
The crisis in the world economy has brought Karl Marx (1818-1883) to the surface and his main work, published between 1867 and 1894, writes the date of the former President of GDP in the book Yrjö Hakane published today in Marx's capital.
"He is now taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his speech.
Marx’s estimates of capitalist economic development, internationalisation and intrusion have proved to be an amazingly remote one for all sectors of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money and imaginary capital.
A list of books based on the Capital Seminars organised by Hakas is also available from Aalto University Professor Sixten Korkman, a respected owner of the economy.
In the book Korkman writes Marx's current "butt and forever".
I mean, isn't the former CEO of the Business Research Institute and the Business delegation a Marxian?
No, no, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not think Marx is a timely economic thinker, but rather an interesting socialist.
Today social sciences have distinguished and specialized, but Marx was a philosophy, historian, sociologist, economic scientist, journalist, political agitator, and hours of literature.
"The real idea is that the theory of the dead men tells about wrong opinions," Korkman starts.
It's true that Marx's predictions were hard to deal with.
While Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the initial art of capitalism, Korkman wondered.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical position.
"The most relevant in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again we are discussing Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to anyone who wants to understand a big picture, as a result of a technical upheaval to change the world", Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is no help from Marx.
In his view, capitalism was an hopeless case that should only be stopped.
But it's still worth Marx's work at Korkman's thinking that he's getting to know each other.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't read," says Korkman.
"The Mamans and Trotskis and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more of each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political weight of the back years.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's thinking world, like other classics," says Korkman.
The United Nations is calling for war crimes in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes in Sri Lanka, reports AFP.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report is accused of war crimes both by Sri Lankan armed forces and by the rebels known as Tamils.
In the civil war in Sri Lanka, at least 100 000 people are estimated to have died.
Even the number of victims is not accurate.
In particular, in the last months of the long war, the major attack of armed forces in 2009 should be properly investigated, and the UN report demands.
The Sri Lankan armed forces report accused of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely to be men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of coercion of by-laws and children as fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to conduct an investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice because foreign judges.
In the UK yo test, you were able to redecorate social media.
On Wednesday, in the autumn, there was a long foreign language that was mostly English.
His skills were tested by over 16,000 experiments.
Even if it was an experiment, it could be written about social media.
Based on his experience, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of 150-250 words in English could point to the keeper of the web page.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for the rest of Leelia, Finland.
She had to ask for advice on how parents should also look at matters for young people.
There were four subjects of the substance, one of which had to be chosen.
"It was the hardest of them", assessed the third topic of Porvoo's Swedish-speaking high school in English by Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was just a commitment from the former President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso.
The fourth topic, Lybeck said it was nice.
It had to write a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school has been trained to write words," Lybeck says and estimates the whole experiment as "mell normal".
In Finnish or Swedish - English experience, questions were answered about texts that included, for example, the adaptation of the summer hat to climate change and the processing of large pools of information.
On Wednesday, a certain length of Russians were also written (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The autumn articles continue on Friday, when there is another domestic or Swedish or Finnish test.
The test is organised normally in the upper secondary schools, i.e. the mood of the employees does not affect it.
The University College invites them to test for appropriate transport connections in time to get to the trial.
Further time may be provided if it can be demonstrated that delays were not due to their own negligence.
The deal was robbed in Oulu, under threat.
On Wednesday morning, a shop was robbed in Oulu.
According to the police, the robber had been dressed in dark clothes and a commando box covering his face.
He's normal and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money for the prey movement.
We're looking into this as a serious robbery.
Police prepare for the arrival of thousands of protestors in Helsinki - Support teams from elsewhere in Finland
The protest against government surgical decisions will be blocked by the Helsinki Centre on Friday, predicting the police.
According to preliminary data, even tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of SAK, Akka and STK's associations will meet at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The task of the police at work is not only to carry out alarms and other police activities, but also to ensure the smooth functioning of the giant animal manifestation.
The road leading to the railway service shall be closed from motor vehicles for about 9.30 a.m. to 14.
Only alarm vehicles are released to the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off from Kaisaniemi’s traffic circle, west of Mannerheim.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
For now, at least it looks like it's enough.
I'm not taking a position on the police's fight.
According to Kujala, support teams from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki because of the demonstration.
The exact patrol officer won't tell me.
"Some of us are coming, but as a rule, we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
Police are calling to avoid private car traffic in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic pump extends from Hakaniemi level to the core centre.
It is expected that standing traffic will be expected from morning to early evening.
With protestors from elsewhere in Finland, many orders are also coming to Helsinki.
They won't be released to the Railways.
Buses leave time at a distance.
The rest of the trip is then to walk to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops Helsinki’s public transport.
From the police's point of view, there's also a positive side.
The issue of the smooth running of public transport, which is normally at the hands of these large crowds, is now partly self-sufficient.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government's economic policy may be in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the demonstration to go smoothly.
After all, people are ordinary people who work or are unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are rational and peaceful people," Kujala says.
There will also be local demonstrations on Friday in different parts of Finland.
In many ways, Friday’s demonstration of mind is exceptional. Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations of mind?
The great demonstration of professional marriages on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good benchmark for Finnish political history, says Professor Emeritus Martti Siisiinen of Sociology at Jyväskylä University.
It's no wonder the Ay movement protested.
If it didn't do that, it would raise your hands in front of the government, says Sisiainen.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the Finnish corporate tradition, as well as the points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard grips are missing contract law.
There are a lot of features here that are really trying to get ay business on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a seat to look at the mirrors.
For example, mirrors are needed because there is no support from all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
The new one is now the steep division in which the demonstration of mind results among the ones that the Ay movement would like to be involved in the demonstration.
The unemployed from all over Finland showed their opinion at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a benchmark for Friday's demonstration of mind, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, says Mustrostorsti in 1993.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostoristi collected one 20 000 unemployed.
The government of Esko Ahon, which is the centre of the world, is coming up from a labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and the employees' organisations was never as bad as during the Aho porvari government.
Now, perhaps even worse than the time of Murrostorsta between the government and the Ay movement.
Besides, there is now a very high level of dust government in Finland, says Siisiinen.
The present government coalition is still so interesting that it is such a strict right, despite the words of the basic Finns.
There were certain elements of the old labour movement at the time of the hurdle.
Several thousand protestors are expected on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and possibly closes day care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive the undivided support of employees, it can become the greatest for years.
In Helsinki, about 300 demonstrations have been organised annually in recent years.
They're out of range.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Ay movement in Finland have been quite peaceful, even though the way in which they have worked has grown in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is legal.
The protestors seek to avoid damage or destruction of property, says Sisiainen.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The demonstration culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on them.
The strike of firemen lasted three months in 1998.
Among other things, there were spectacular strikes for pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical lakes of the 1970s
The main varnishes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electric varnish in 1977.
70,000 metal men were involved in the strike of metalmen.
The strike was suspended on the proposal of the Conciliation Board for seven weeks.
Metal workers received a 16% raise.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused power losses around the country.
In 1993, it was a mess.
On 4 November 1993, around 20,000 people, many of whom were made unemployed, met in favour of the Parliamentary House to show their opinion on behalf of the work.
Firemen lived three months in 1998
The firemen's strike was one of the longest in the 1990s unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
In 1994, the police had been caught up in eggs in protests by farmers against the EU.
"Siberia is teaching, the EU will stop," was one of the hit words.
Espa's farmers had tons of snow.
Also in 1999, the Helsinki EU Summit allowed farmers to protest and burn hay boats in front of the meeting place.
In 1983 and 1995, the nurses lived in the country.
For about a month, nurses lived in prison in 1995.
For the last time, they had been in strike in 1983.
The 1995 strike was colored by some deaths during the strike.
He threatened the strike and the nurses' mass resuscitations in 2007.
In the end, the negotiations on the threat of mass demarcation had speeded up the outcome.
Doctors were limping in 2001
"Doctors in strike - escape," was part of the strike of leaching doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospitals lasted for five months and resulted in a lively debate on how strike can jeopardise patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised medical fees.
Students on the move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students march for study support in Helsinki from the Senate to the Parliamentary Hall in 2013.
Central criminal police will find out the backgrounds of the Finno-French, full of refugees, to the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have requested help from the Central Criminal Police to find out the backgrounds of a refugee record registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped the border of Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck might have been on its way to Finland.
They were all in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility are at the scene in Austria, says Superintendent Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by truck to Austria became more fatal.
Of course, at that time, all 71 passengers on board died with suffocation.
According to General Radio, which first told us about cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish company.
The company conducts restaurant activities, among other things, and its managing director is a foreign-lawed man, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two of the Iranianism has been arrested for trafficking in human beings.
The refugee captain, the former drug criminal, and the drowned businessman, the story of five smugglers.
The Uphoric king of smugglers, the violent boatman, the stylish missionary, and the taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, such people engage in trafficking in human beings into the European Union.
The criminalologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci at the University of Trento have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their clients, and their book Death Travel Office is published in Finnish this week.
In the book they present the hips of human trafficking, present solutions and present smugglers from different stairs of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
The light islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many of the Tunisians are heading for the summer trip.
On behalf of their location, the islands are also excellent for smuggling, as there are only 120 kilometres to travel to the island of Lampedusa, Italy.
Due to comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives in Emir, in the chain, the burning captain, and the father of six children.
The islands of light are famous for their shrimps, but it is more productive for the fishermen to carry people.
It has been done by Emir on its blue, ten-metre wooden water hundreds of times.
If the boat's full of feathers, it'll fit 40 people.
One trip, Emir, after the expenses, makes about 8 000 euros.
Emir has five assistants looking for her clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive in many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation was calmed down until the refugee crisis came again.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna island in small groups.
Emir's going to put them in empty houses for as long as he sees good.
Food is given in such a way that customers just and just stay alive.
The accommodation costs about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer leaves the money, it's their problem.
We're going to go to the water in the middle of the night with the lantern.
The first night is driven away from the islands, then stopped, waiting for the day and driving to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the seaport is hard, and passengers cry and throw up at 20 metres in heights.
At the most, human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants her to be scared.
That's why he beats his clients, and at least he says he's gonna beat the sounders to death.
He says in the book that once the police kept him occupied, he threw all his passengers across the street and ordered them to swim on the nearest island.
"I've made customers one by one from the neck and threw them across the line," says Emir in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of Sahara.
His countrymen are told he's gonna have to handle this.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
We need to show them who's in charge here.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran's a regular cab driver in Boovaš, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good. The starter engine's been rolling on its last one, and anyway, it's seen the best of its days.
However, the main thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi moves at all, moving towards the Hungarian border.
Boovaša is a 500 inhabitants' little village about 60 kilometers from Belgrade to lunch.
The centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mainly released.
In the forests surrounding the centre, without their families, men are staying in tents, camps, and abandoned cars, which now everyone has been able to find or build.
Families living in the forest who have not lodged an asylum application for Serbia for a reason or another.
Some people also stay in private homes, but it's a public secret.
Among the foresters, Gora finds most of her customers.
These are often stolen - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of cross-borders and weekly walks in difficult lands, often mountain areas and in the dark.
At the end of arriving in the Boovasha region, in the vicinity of the great trafficking of human beings, people are victims of death.
The Kyyts of Goran are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi, and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he'll tell you in the book.
"They say their business once, and that's enough," Gora says.
He says the Africans are trying to make a mess.
That's not what Goran likes.
Stupid fool all the way.
For example, 300 euros are agreed for the first time, then they fall to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran stresses that he's a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he's doing a job cheaper than the rest of us and he's going to charge a ride to Hungary's border with only 50 euros per person.
It's a three-mile trip, most of the comfortably motorway.
I hear the colleagues are asking for a three or four-fold price.
Goran deserves about 50,000 euros a year.
It's not a lot of money for smuggler, but it's a very nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport migrants 12 km closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran does not care: he knows the ways and the roads, and takes his cyclists a mile away from the border.
Then he shows his customers the right direction and he's going to get rid of it.
The Work of Singing
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Missionary, and it's not just a nickname.
He truly has a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital city of Uganda, with many believers fleeing from Congo, and a small centre to help the Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Consignor runs from a smuggling business, where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He looks at the work of mercy.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoe many times a day and makes sure that the rubber tape of his white collars cries elegantly under the low waist of his jeans.
The host is proud of his new Mercedes, his mastro and his three motorcycles.
When the Ambassador does not preach, he will arrange people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
At first, the customer will call in one of the five telephone numbers of the sending company.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money from you and sail in the midst of the traffickers who cross the border.
In order to obtain a asylum seeker or refugee status, the authorities of Uganda must be told that they have come from, for example, the areas of war in northern Kiev, and that they have had to flee their homes to violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Consignor will arrange a new identity for the customer.
The old identity card will be destroyed and another one will be acquired.
It'll help us contact the Ambassador at Uganda Police Department.
After that, the customer will be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum procedures, NGOs, and finally the United Nations Refugee Organisation (UNHCR).
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He will charge each port separately: an application to Ugandan police will cost about EUR 100, a document to a humanitarian organisation of approximately 150, and a migration process, for example, EUR 4 500-7 000 in a European country.
Folio and ice-creams
Tom's a beginner, a former drug criminal.
A four - year - old Irish on the coast of France at Calais, where his job is to load people into the trucks on his way to Britain.
He has an Afghan, a French taxi driver in London, and dozens of trucks who may not even know he is in a trafficking business.
At night, Tom and the cab driver picked up their clients, usually 2-3 people, one of Calais' centers.
They're driving A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would have to go straight to prison to arrange illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been sitting there for seven years because of drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs over the highway with his customers to the resting place where the drivers sleep before they continue across the canal to Britts.
Tom picks a suitable truck, he's gonna have to make sure it's on his way to England, not even Holland, and he's going to cut the safety net.
It's gotta be done quiet so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is on the line, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wrapped his client in an aluminium foil, similar to the one wrapped around the cooker or oven potatoes in the kitchen.
That should keep the police from spotting a hideout from the heat scanner.
Some use ice-filled sleeping bags for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place hoping he wasn't driving a bunch of midwives before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçuk is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
The Ukrainian Turkish population has been called a marketing master and an undisputed king of the Mediterranean countries, which manages sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, Küçuk has been operating and has continuously developed new forms of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage in relation to other entrepreneurs: he still wants the money.
One of the new methods is the luxury platform: Turkish ports are rented to take American or European families to a few days of tourist cruises.
In reality, ships will be loaded into a full range of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who will first be transported from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe.
Customers are stored in human stocks, for example in old industrial halls until they are ready to leave.
People are going to go to minibuss and drive somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it's given, we need to get on board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way under the deck.
The Navy can only observe the depth of the ship’s swim, as no other signs of human population are visible.
Food and drink is given, but the less passengers exude and throw up, the better.
Küçuk receives approximately 53 000 euros from one luxury ship after the expenses.
He does not handle practical things himself, but hire captains, recruiters, guards, accommodationers and other smaller factors to do the work for himself.
During the summer period, transportation takes place at least hundreds and Küçuk earns millions.
He is thought to have bought out over 100 homes through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company and over 100 apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçuk was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the Turkish Democratic Party representative and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
After that, he's probably gone.
Correction 16.9.15 at 15.10 p.m.: The Death Travel Office book will appear with this, not next week.
American Olympics reports their illness and becoming a prostitute in their book
Three times at the Olympics, the new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a racer of 1,500 metres, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton tells us in his book Fast Girl about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published a breakdown of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at Sydney Olympics.
He came to the contest in top condition and ran for the second best time in the race.
In the final, however, he was panicking.
At first, he rushed to the top and defended his leadership on a underground run.
At 150 meters before the paint, however, his powers were overthrown.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I made myself cross the line, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from a bi-directional disorder.
His brother Dan had been doing years before Sydney's race suicide, and he himself felt enormous pressure on success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with strange men.
He also called on his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's cab was 450 euros an hour.
He tells me he's spent the money on a luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations of becoming a prostitute was that he needed the same adrenaline peaks as he had in his race for public sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was ill with a bi-directional disorder.
The double life of the former Star Leader came out at the end of 2012, when the Smoked Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 meters away from the world's statistics during time 3.57,40, but remained the last of Sydney's Olympics.
The world champion was glad when the marriage put the Norwegian skis under the control of the "Silver Back".
In the opinion of at least one of its colleagues, the Norwegian skiling lady Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of convenience.
The Northug and the Norwegian skiing union have failed throughout the summer and last autumn in the same way as the athlete's agreement.
Even though the Union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it is not suitable for a multi-time world champion and the Olympics.
The consequences of the dispute in the Norwegian skiing union decided to exclude Northug from the future period of the world.
The decision was given thanks to the double champion of the world, Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put the ski away.
"Thank you for showing your spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian skiing union and Northug is about money.
Northug would obviously like to be part of the season of the country team so that he could promote his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said that he was happy to represent an alliance that would also care for future generations, and that he would not let one athlete’s bowels.
At the same time, he pointed out that the Union has given Northug both economic and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug published his own notice on Tuesday, in which he assured himself he wanted to be brave in Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup as well as in the World Cup and the Olympics.
In total, Astrid Jacobsen won six MM medals, two gold medals.
He was involved last winter in Fallu in a team that won the communication gold.
The shielding day of the pastors is also celebrated in the north
On the day of the race, 25.9. there will be paces in various restaurants and shops that have been given the shield of the pastors.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of food expertise and reduce the threshold for going to a restaurant and to raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants have focused on the capital region, but the high restaurants that are controlled and classified by an impartial operator can be found around Finland.
International attention to the event is shown by the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of turtle restaurants and organisations.
In the north, the day will be held in a restaurant in Vasas in Fondis and Kantarelli.
In Kokkola, the turtle day takes part in the Old Town restaurant.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make an organisation one of the most important international events that will take place in the same day in a different world.
Finland will continue to be the host country of the event.
Kauhaki-lehti: Legal Chancellor applied for the establishment of a remote reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in the premises of LSK Business Park Oy, currently owned by the Kauhava ex-Suus.
According to the complaint, there is still a permanent nature of the critical infrastructure of the time of crisis in the region, which is used by the Defence Forces and its co-operators, i.e. the Finnish Eriklis netot Oy.
The Kauhakori-lehti reports that, according to a private person, the placement of a reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, defence forces may have interests in relation to the area and airport of the former Air War School, whose impact has not also been investigated when the reception centre was prepared, the paper writes.
The case states that for the last two years, negotiations have been held on the organisation of flight training and the results of any foreign operator to the airport.
The case has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (p.p.) and Minister of Defence Arto Rhdy.
A private person tells the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about the principle of opposition to the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned place in the former reserve area is wrong.
The remote city government discussed reception center issues last Monday.
Zone: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The administration means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented on journalists in the evening after meeting the presidents of all parliamentary parties in Mäntyniem.
According to the President, concerns about refugee governance were linked to all participants.
He values the ability of the Government and opposition parties in Finland to discuss confidentially fundamental issues.
Especially these days, when we face great challenges
The situation in Syria and the activities of Russia and the United States can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
It is desirable to have a dialogue on the development of the dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the continuing tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to the committee, the issue of NATO was also addressed in the discussions.
The president did not take a position on the situation in the labour market.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, beginners catch up for a few hours

Cars are not allowed from the course of Mannerheimts in the direction of Kaivotua, Postikatu and Work Bay in the direction of the railway station.
From the Union's corner of Hakaniemi, transport is directed to the Union's street in the case of Kaisaniemi's traffic circle.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the number of people involved in the demonstration.
Only alarm vehicles shall be released to the area.
Metro and horse-hunts in the whole Friday's demonstration
Metro and tram drivers participate in Friday's demonstration of the morning traffic to the end of the night.
The Society of Raitio and Metro staff informed the STT about this evening.
The majority of Alkos closes for two hours, including posts closed
Friday’s demonstration also results in disturbances with Post’s services.
Significant delays are expected, among other things, for the distribution of daily mail.
Most of the postal service points are closed.
The blood transport of the Finnish Red Cross is maintained despite the strike.
Food transport as well as the dispatching of hospitals and laboratory samples are also being carried out.
Situational information on services can be found on Post's website.
Most of Finland’s Initials will close its doors for two hours on Friday.
The Employment Union of Services Pam has instructed its employees to stop work between 11:00 and 13.
Pam has also called on daily asset trading workers to participate in the demonstration of professional organisations.
SOK and Kesko’s representatives will tell the Helsinki Word that sales are being made to keep open, if necessary, the superiors.
According to Kesko, the possibility of closing individual stores is not yet known.
Helsingin part closed
The day care centres in Helsinki do not operate in full on Friday, inform the Helsinki Early Education Office.
Because of the interest of professional organisations, day-care may be concentrated in certain day-care centres, and day-care centres and play parks are not organised.
Full-time homes and groups of children with developmental disabilities and many disabled children remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of people with developmental disabilities and autistic schoolchildren will be organised normally.
The Office for Early Education is authorised to inform more about the changes in the operation tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipula takes a big risk
According to Sipil, communication requires a wide range of channels, and television and radio calls from the Prime Minister are one channel among others.
A channel for such a direct speech is also needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä said to journalists in the Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches become.
According to Sipilä, talks may not always be transmitted on Yle's channels.
If other channels report to channel, then let's see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipila said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires that TV and radio be given to citizens.
This dossier, which is now being debated, is quite complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipila figured it out.
The call will be sent at 21.05-21.20 both on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Areena.
I'm gonna take a big risk.
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's TV won't tell us about the more general government turning in.
Is it an attempt to take more strictly the right to define a public debate and to refuse the public debate on the issues? the professor of the University of Stockholm, Anu Koivonen, was considering.
It reminds me of the recent comment by the Foreign Minister (Timo) that he does not respect the media agenda and does not allow it to define itself.
In the name of a democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters will not be linked.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is agitated by Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of policy-makers are not about communication issues in democracy.
The role of the Media representatives is, in a definition, to try not to take the agendas of politicians.
According to the hard work, TV is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, the Sipil should bring something new and special to the table so that the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech can be met.
Is there any more of what we've heard today?
Or can he speak in different words, in different ways, or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there are only more of the same old age in the promise, you must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it extraordinary time.
In this respect, everyone takes the risk in the sense that it is not a particular situation but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will become a message from politicians or Parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with the interest of Ylen or the general line.
A bright bet from the top
In the forthcoming speech, it is also important that what the Prime Minister does not say is emphasised by the media investigator.
Tonight, you must look closely at where Sipilä is missing and what you do not want, says Heikki Kuut, research coordinator at Jyväskylä University.
According to the six TVs, Sipil is a lively bet, because this is how it gets its own view out of the air without the sound of the rucksacks.
In this way, the message is made available to the public without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The Sipils pass the media and speak directly to the people.
However, the risk is that the media interprets something wrong, since specific questions are not available.
Six says it's very important how Sipila appears on TV, whether sweats or sweats.
He compares Sipila to his father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If Sipila can do her job well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to report on something, because here man is like speaking directly to another person.
Such (United States President Barack) Obama and partners are regularly engaged.
Very exceptional
Researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the public as truly exceptional.
He said that this has not happened in decades, that the Prime Minister will speak directly to the people.
Extraordinary time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The investigator believes that this is how the Prime Minister wants Finns to be supportive to the pre-eminent tensions.
On Friday, employees' organisations are organising a demonstration and strike against government activities.
The President of the Left Association, Paavo Arhinmäki, says on Twitter that Sipilä could speak about the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, when the talk could also be discussed.
The Chairman of the SDP Antti Rinne (cf.) again announces his challenge for Sipilä's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
Almost six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
The 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere
He was fine at the moment he was found.
THE son's father updated his Facebook page.
The Home Finland police department will also confirm the matter to the East Side.
The boy went out to play out at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later tonight, he was never contacted.
My father thanks all the people who helped us find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
This update was distributed 15 000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time period.
The UFC star in Finland was disappointed in the violence of young people: You will be hated at the moment.
Makwan Amirhani, a Kurditist freelancer, published a video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to young people who are immigrants.
Makwan Amirhani had to speak against the street fights of young people.
Amirhani, born in Iran and entering Finland at 5 years of age, has so far won both her professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirhani says he received a message asking for a Instagram account.
There are videos loaded on the account where young people fight with the most violent grips.
Amirhani tells me he's disappointed in the execution of youngsters.
26-year-old Amirhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick in the ground, sit on one side, and knock out without thinking about any of these consequences, as you make these videos, Amirhani updates.
It's hard to defend
Some of the young people on the video are immigrant.
According to Jarmo Heinonen, the Helsinki Police Commissioner, social media has been downloaded by both immigrants and young people from Finland.
It's the fact that you're fighting on the street at all.
You make life harder for many other immigrants here in Finland, Turkish Amirhani reminds you.
Amirhani reminds us that Finland has websites looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These isolated cases have become very severe.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you now.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be very long guests here.
That's a little different to thank you for being here, says Amirhani.
Amirhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become the target of some racism, then you'll have to blame it on yourselves.
Now, think about it a couple of times before you go in with one of those guys.
Amirhani says that violent activity makes a contribution to racism.
You're the kind of hate that I don't like.
You've got things pretty bad anyway, and that's not gonna make it any better, Amirhani.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter Lauri Lyly, Chairman of the SAK, says that on Monday, the employees' organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STKK.
Lauri Lyly commented on St.T.K.'s proposal on Twitter.
In the past Wednesday, the Staff Centre’s STK informed the Government of its proposal to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central).
The President-in-Office of the Programme, Mr Fjäder, believes that the Government will accept the proposal if SAK, STKK and the Plan are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest wager organisation, SAK, be softening its previous position.
Lauri Lyly, Chairman of the SAK, commented in a few words on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with this on Monday.
According to Lylyn, SAK is looking for solutions to open a labour market lock, and the status of forced law requires agreements concluded by active parties.
Lyly points out that the proposal by Prime Minister Sipilä's Government for a social agreement did not fit the SAK.
In the past, Sipilä cut off the negotiations on a social agreement when SAK refused to commit to the objective of the 5% productivity cut.
Comment: A great demonstration threatens to sneeze - "It's a little silly to put a fist"
I mean, I feel like it's a little silly to put a fist in my pocket if there's a piece of reconciliation paper in my pocket, write Pekka Tiininen.
The feelings vary from one area to another in the wage camps.
Is it supposed to call the government to annul it, or will it be settled?
On Monday, SAK’s Federal Directors came forth with sacred hatred for the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to close.
And the Uto spread to the stimuli.
OAJ, a teacher's trade union, threatened to close schools and day-care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: none of the schools or day-care centres are completely closed.
In Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd) President of the Staff Centre for Staff, STK, appeared to be in agreement.
He told us that he had contacted the government and made a five-percent productivity cut required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.
Sture Fjäder (Cok) of the current President rushed to announce that his agreement paper was already ready.
At first, SAK's office didn't even belong to the yard.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the Federal Directors just ordered the country to stand on Friday.
Finally, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should tend to accept a 5 % productivity cut as a target.
No wonder Palolaan STK's relationship with the Sipila Government is fine.
The right hand of Palola, Head of the St.T.K. Social Impact, Jukka Eineus, former Minister of Central Affairs, Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi, served as special support.
Palola also described the improvement in the government's ay-skilling skills.
Sattuma or no, but Palola's exit took a little break from Finland's standers, whose image is the wedding of the ACP Marko Rajaainen (sd).
I mean, I feel like it's a little silly to put a fist in my pocket if there's already some amicable paper in my pocket.
Modified at 18.00: Added information about Lylyn's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The Russian duumaan President, Sergei Naryshkin, criticises the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
Sergei Naryshkin, President of the Russian duuma, believes that Mongolia is better than Finland's father, Etyj.
In the capital city of Mongolia, Ulan Batori has begun the prosecution of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July festival meeting.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were forced from the European Union to attend the meeting - a matter of which the President reminded journalists of.
We believe that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin printed the news office according to Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was not only directed at Finland and the EU, but also to the United States, where his access had been prevented.
Sanctios are a political suicide from the EU, declared Naryshki.
The Russian delegation in Mongolia has become complex, so Naryshkin continued to covet Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for the 'special organisation'.
I am sure that the parliamentary general meeting will go hand in hand with positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have any obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva, a meeting in Ulan Bator, who has already discussed Russian delegation, according to the Russian media.
The lock meets the real playoff mirror: "The paints tightly"
Tapara and Lockko are going to continue their bull days in Hakamets tonight, while they're both on fire on the second day of the day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today's Hakamets will not see a real goal party.
The killer went to Kuopio last night to pick up a 3-2-long-time victory from KalPa.
The rise was a manly one, for the silver team of the last season was the worst of two goals.
The lock on Tuesday was much more molluscous.
As a guests of Blues, who started on the Iron Hall with a strong start, there were round zero points, and the loss readings were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, lockman Janne Lahti anticipated situations on the follow-up pages.
The killer has formed quite a playoff nightmare for the Raumas.
In fact, in the last two years, the tapara has just dropped in the spaces from the Locko finals series.
Both layers call for a decisive seventh match.
In the last season, the lock took the series to a break already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose on the next three sides and passed.
There are no major changes in the composition of the groups, except for goals.
Both of those who rejected us last night will be on a mission today.
With the kill paint Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhuse, and between the lock-tops Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Face: Up in the top, a terrible play is going on
The Sports Director, Loola, scripted head coach Rautkallio, inconvenient to the follow-up, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote Rocky's film, where he himself played the main part.
The Underdog was sensationalally putting a heavyweight series on Apollo Creed, world champion.
Rocky got great sympathy even though eventually the title match was lost.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Tovaila's script was written in Pori by an unsatisfied ashtray.
An anonymous and wooden package of luggage advanced to all as a surprise to the SM standard 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underdogs like Rocky.
There were white Indians, Porin Matti and Pele Pelto.
In the drop-off games, the players dyed their heads red and cut the ironies.
It's a blonde.
That's what JP Jalo called coach Neumann.
The ace took the winning silver.
It was one of the heroes.
The writer, Tovaila, believes that this season's novelty works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports leader of the mothers has built the potter on behalf of the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been rotting some shit in the faraway like Rocky's pig carcases at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparise are in some kind of a game other than a rock game.
The hope has forgotten that the main part of Rocky VI is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has been crucified to Sean Conners of Rautakallion.
Rautakallio is handicrafted in Rocky as a clumsy main performer as Connery would have been in the original work of 1976.
There's nothing in the iron ceiling but a favorite name for Rocky.
The game philosophy of Rautakallion is not part of the rushing and small-scale movement.
He appreciates a tough game, but there's a different thing to play hard as a pig.
In the last season, the Aässien Garrett Stafford had a stick in the head of Jere Karjalainen Tapparan.
He got two plus ten minutes from that chair, but Raitatallio put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We're the only ones who deserve to play.
I don't accept a game like that, and it's not part of an aceking, and after the game, Rautakallio's gone hot.
The team of this season is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, cops, colognes.
There are virtually no key players in the best game age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the art project.
How much have you been able to influence game acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the last period affect procurement and, unfortunately, the situation on the market was rather limited, Rautakallio responded diplomaticly.
Underneath the light.
In 1953, Rautakallio is clearly interested in becoming a sports bomb.
Men's contracts end in spring.
The top balance in the three leagues of the season has as many losses as the difference between goals 1 and 6.
I wish I hadn't written the rest of the script.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temone reveals that if she had met her husband when he was a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
For the first time, Olga Temonen plays under the guidance of his husband.
Yes, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, acting, and producer Olga Temone laughing.
He's been married to the Abilanna ex-Basisist and director Tuukka Temos since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but now Olga plays in the direction of Tuukka for the first time.
Olga's role in the early years of abilanta's story, you made us the most beautiful of us, is the drummer's mother, Sipe Santapuk, Sirkka.
Sirkka zemppa and support his son, even though his father Risto (to present Lorenzo Backmann) tries to be a sense of sound.
The more I have become acquainted with my true example of Sirkka, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me in the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that, the twin has been getting a lot closer.
They've met, they've been on the phone and they've been texting.
She's been helping so much.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
It is also a good thing Sirkka understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be a little colored.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apatila would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, it was flat and really mean.
There was a pretty small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had a stroke, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot about Tuukka since she was young before she was planning a movie.
However, the parents’ stories have sometimes been slightly different.
Yeah, well, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you're up to.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from Heinola’s evil skater - known Tuuka.
Olga was a good girl who had nothing to do with the Tuukka movie.
At his highest, he could have been a secret charm.
Olga said that she's been working so hard in 10 years with Tuukka that a big joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always been a super-hot.
Now, the whole production group is going to go to Heinola for a month.
However, the couple living in ancient Israel often plan to drive home because of their little children, because the distance is not too long.
We're going to take over Heinola for the whole month.
They have taken us very warmly, only to ask what streets and when to clear them.
Iron Sky 2 rose to Finland's most expensive play film
The Iron Sky, directed by Timo Vuorensola: The Coming Race film budget is EUR 17 million.
The photographs will begin in October in Belgium.
Timo Vuorensola begins filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The following part of Iron Sky’s scientific film, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will be the most expensive play film ever in Finland, with its budget of EUR 17 million.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been at Jalmar Helander Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation, which is under way, will also rise after completion of Iron Sky 2, as the film budget is over EUR 100 million.
Timo Vuorensola's film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, starts in October near Antwerp, near the AED Studios, and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
The giant budget is not afraid.
I've been on a sick date!
I'm so relaxed about the file script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize that something is going on.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show you this movie to the audience, he'll tell the Night magazine.
Originally, 8-10 million had been envisaged for the film, but as the script developed, the budget was also increased.
The budget's big, but it's a big story too.
However, 100 million would be added to the film because each angle and efficiency are so expensive.
Now everything's so tight that there's nothing to find.
Today, the production company Iron Sky Universe launched a public finance campaign and a mass loan that is paid at an annual rate of 4-8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
After two years, the company will pay back the loan.
The film features Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
Big logos are coming back to the shirts.
The fronts of the Trends have recently been decorated with big logos.
Just a while ago, a fashionable dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocses in a concert.
The advertising of a hood or t-shirt was seen as a bit of a jinx.
But times change.
Sport has become the true megatrendi of fashion, and so have the old, familiar sports fashion marks such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the cooly wave.
And as often as before, the border of the stench and trendy one is diabolical: if something is already right, it starts to turn into iron and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. a tavis fashion, where trendsetters surprised us by promoting as boring basic clothing as possible, as if as a way to separate themselves from mass.
Now on top of the grey basic college, instead of the one that buried on the bottom of the cabinet, the front of which is the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, for example, Adidas identified track screens, favorite team gaming shirts and New York Yankees flags have returned to the street fashion.
After all, the Calvin Klein logos of the Alguists are now a cool detail.
Trendi seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands too.
For example, the front of Versace’s sculptors makes clear what kind of clothing is.
Would you be willing to present logos in your dress?
The Russian politician published evidence: I did not get stuck in the tank too!
It is claimed that a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, which held the Russian Arms Expo 2015 presentation of Russian war industry products.
Over the past few days, the Russian press has been saying that the Russian Emergency Department had to remove the large size of Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook page, which looks like he's snooping from the hatch of the armored vehicle in very good moods and, at least, on the basis of those pictures, it's not about getting drunk or getting angry.
Full of nonsense.
Let's start with not going into the battle armor truck, but it was a raiding tank wagon BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, serving at Ural.
I went in there, looked around, and I came out in peace, and Zotov said to Komosolskaya Pravda.
I wasn't stuck and I definitely didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
To the Russian army television channel, Zotov explained his desire for Russian technology in the exhibition because he was a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagons, and I was very interested in our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to every tank.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the raid wagons, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the author's stupidity.
One fool wrote and all the others repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm tall and ugly, but nothing that I'd be stuck in a tank, didn't happen, he said Russkaja sluzhba was not on the radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged talk have been published, even though 50 000 people have been at the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov's wedding began in the beginning of the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotov was told to crawl out of his tank trunk trying to kill everyone around, and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around, unless he gets out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the exhibition organisers explained their views on what happened.
Everyone's just used to the fact that soldiers jump out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, because of his large size, simply waited when he came out.
But he didn't sit there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Alexander Pisarevski Bloknot.

The architect brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen's candle from 1962 seems to be designed today.
The cubic steel frame is like an art work, and that's what it originally was.
The shape of the architect brothers is known for a long and mathematical time.
At first, it was presented only to the respected guests of the lords.
The Kubus candles are manufactured by the family company By Lassen, who maintains the design heritage of the renowned brothers.

The Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland's Kittilä mine has had a leak.
The water of the gold mine has been leaked from the so-called sand of wealth to its stream.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the bleeding.
In Alta, the foaming process is neutralized by enrichion sand and purified process water.
Usually, water is pumped into the environment either again as process water or according to the permit, through the surface lighting field.
The bleeding rate was estimated to be approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of leak water meets the current permit conditions.
The rest of the material didn't fall into the environment.
The bleeding was observed during the inspection round Monday morning.
The bleeding has not been observed to cause structural damage to the base of the vessel.
The company will report on its close cooperation with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuppämäki: IMF warns you not to cut too much
The country report published by the IMF today follows largely the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization has traveled to structural reforms covering Finland in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overemployment benefits and paid leave would help Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed in the whole contract system and in unemployment security.
According to the main economic operator of Danske Bank Pasi Kuppamäe, structural reforms are agreed, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a great deal of sympathy for government action, but on the other hand, there are words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
For example, infrastructure investments, Kuopamäki says to the Economic Area.
In the view of the IMF, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates an economic growth rate of 0.4% for Finland for this year, up to 0.9% next year.
In today's new economic forecast, Danske predicts that growth will remain on the arrow this year.
The IMF is slightly more optimistic this year.
They may have had the most recent findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was in a small increase this summer, says Kuoputamäki.
Less attention has been given to reduced confidence in industry or other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences concern only a few per cent of the decimal places.
Nintendo who recovers from death appointed a new leader
In July, under the influence of Satupu Iwata, who died of cancer, Ttsuma Kimishima began work on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo from 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face game industry.
Iwata, for example, responded successfully to Wii-konsol’s launch.
The 65-year-old Kimishima's choice is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, assessing Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima’s task is seen as being strongly involved in mobile games, but it does not eat bread on the part of the traditional game consoles of the company.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that even hundreds of children who have come to the country will disappear annually.
Among other things, SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minors disappear each year.
Chief Inspector Juha Kannelmaa of the Finnish Immigration Service tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants disappear in a "land under" year?- A total of 156 minor asylum applications were made in Finland in 2013.
They lost 9.
In 2014, 196 applications were made and 11 of them disappeared.
The result of the disappearance may be that it is clear that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and that he may have been found to be a full age there.
In such cases, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue handling the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for handling the application.
Similarly, a part of the missing persons will be found later when they seek asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, Finland had a total of 3651 asylum seekers, of which 134 applications were decided to lapse because the applicant was likely to move away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared during the past 123 years, he says.
Is there an increase?
By 6.9 this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for minor asylums.
However, the number of minors who have disappeared this year is known and clearly increased, which is likely to affect the number of persons who have disappeared, he stresses.
What happens to those who take the decision on the conversion?
Will they, for example, be lost to the "migid labour market"?
It is difficult to assess this from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police responsible for the implementation of the return decisions, Kannelmaa stresses.
The Minister of Interior Petter Orpo has been concerned about the growing number of non-registrationrs.
He has taken action on this matter.
At the EU's Internal Ministerial meeting, the Orpo, on Monday, told about practical measures to manage asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of the devices
Timo T.A., who has lost his ability to work due to sickness, is now selling equipment for TV and radio production in Mikkosen.
Mikkosen’s spouse Nina Mikkonen sells Huuto.net devices that were once the most advanced professional tools in their field.
The first newspaper Iltamasin reported on the Internet announcement.
Today, much of the equipment has remained in the feet of technological development.
The digital media world no longer describes television programs for Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that you will find those interested in you.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but these are needed as long as there is an old generation of material that must be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also many professionals - collectors and constructionists of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is considering IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are trying to move away from their present House of Myrskylä.
There's no way we can take all the supplies with us.
I've begun to innovate and see where they're giving up.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkenen says.
There's no more use for television and radio equipment.
It's clear from a recent stroke that the man who made a long career won't come back to work.
Nina Mikkenen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. The actual life work of Mikkosen was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives visited the box shop to pick up movies and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic is more likely to be drilled than thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and train drivers will decide today whether they will expand their efforts in relation to Friday's demonstration of mind.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram transport only for Friday's demonstration of mind.
During the afternoon, it will resolve whether the traffic will stop all day.
Chief Agent Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is great on the ground.
Night and daytime cuts are a bad thing for drivers, so government plans for cutting the seats are agitated by opposition.
Hurvonen wonders, however, that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop by Friday, public transport in the capital area is practically almost completely stopped.
According to VR data, trains do not travel on Friday between dawn and evening.
On Friday, no local or remote traffic is moving.
Trains leaving before dawn shall be driven to destination.
According to HSL's data, most of the buses are going to be on a dead end.
ACP members are out of work on Friday morning at 3:00 p.m. on Saturday morning.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven, driven by the Chief Staff, the HSL informant, Pirko Repo, who considers them.
Repo says that HSL can't say exactly what bus transfers are going on Friday.
The employees' organisations are organising a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Agency on Friday at 11-13 p.m.
Aftonblad: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, says the news office AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled to panic.
According to the local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water pumps against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas, where the teacher thought it was a private watch for a bomb.
In Texas, 14 - year - old Ahmed Mohammed was arrested after the teacher considered his school as a private bomb.
Mohammed told Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to introduce himself to produce his electronic practice.
However, one of the teachers thought it was a bell that looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation finally ended with the boy being taken to a youth detention cell in the cuffs.
It was not said at any point that Mohammed claimed anything but that he had made the watch.
Still, there is still a possibility that the boy will be accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohammed, the cops said the watch looked like a movie bomb.
It's a police watch, but it was obviously made up of a circuit board and a digital display with leads.
The case happened last Monday, and Mohamedia was punished three days of forced school.
His father is furious about the case, and the American Islamic Council of the country wonders whether the case is another example of Islam in the United States.
The British director of Labour refused to sing a national song
In the song, God is asked to protect the queen, but Corby is the opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism put forward by the press of the right is accompanied by representatives of the Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This is an insult to the people, thinking that Kate Green's radio broadcaster at BBC's radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night's memorial ceremony respected the battle of British Air Force pilots against Germany's Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corby in its official opinion and stresses his respect for pilots by participating in the occasion.
We are all in a tremendous debt of gratitude for the heroism of royal airmen.
He (Corbyn) stood still with respect during the national song, stressed the opinion.
Corbyn's choice as a party leader has divided the lines of the Labour.
In particular, there are those among the referendums who fear that he will deport moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral armaments, the cessation of savings and the increase in public expenditure.
For the first time today, Corbyn is due to appear in the role of the party president in this House at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby has asked the public for suggestions on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron picked Corby's choice as party leader on Twitter at the weekend.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our financial security and our families' security, your Prime Minister's sign in his own account.
The cause of the family death in Minnesota is still unclear - the father of the family was waiting for the case.
The South Lake Mintonica police have been investigating the family death in Minnesota Greenwood for a week.
The family of five was found dead in their home on September 10th and a few days later, the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
After his first shot with a shotgun, his wife and three children, Brian Short, killed themselves in the garage.
Dead days
The family was found after having been worried about the absence of children at school.
On the basis of this announcement, the police went to the house to visit the inspection visit and found a huge house on the other side of the Short family as dead.
StarTribune says it's possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A million houses and a successful company
The investigation of the case of South Lake Mintonka police chief Michael Sidar is still ongoing.
The motive for blood tests is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses on a directed social media site in AllNurses.com.
In 2014 StarTribune interview Short told us that there were four million different visitors per week on the site.
I've been offered 50 offers of the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned them all.
But I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, in 2011, when the Short Family bought a crazy house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised in Zillow as a car collector's dream: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also an adequate garage for eight cars.
Legal proceedings pending
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was waiting for the case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various pre-trial courses, had been sued by him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, there had been no comments about the pre-emptive courses removed from the Short Site, and therefore they had lost their customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on short-term transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffees
In addition, three of the owners were awarded at the food event at the Finnish Horse Ownership of Hippous.
This is great. Loiri commented on his honorary chart.
The party, Fabrice Duo, won Derby on Saturday and earned €100,000.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused by the success of Fabrice Duo at the grand competition.
I still don't think it's happening.
According to Lorir, success horse coach Korpi will have full employment while working with the horse.
Pekka will determine where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'm gonna shut up, Loiri laughed.
The amazing gesture from the NHL star "The greatest talent of all time"
The Super Star of Montreal Canadiens, P. K. Subban, has donated $10 million (approximately €6.7 million) to the Montreal Children Hospital.
According to the medical report, the biggest athlete ever made a unique donation to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital in another fundraiser for the next seven years.
Subban and the Canadiens made an eight-year-old deal with $72 million a year ago.
So Subban's donation amount is significantly higher than his $9 million annual contribution.
For a reward for his donation, Subban gets his name from the hospital.
In the past, the Canadiens players have made significant contributions to local hospitals.
A year ago, the long-term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same child hospital, including the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a giant amount of money for the other city’s grand hospital to receive the necessary PET scanner for cancer investigations.
The Japanese coffee can be ordered for a wife's evening, serve food with just bikinis and an Essu on her head.
The theme coffees are a tough thing in Japan.
The market already has a goat coffee, a cane coffee, a vampire coffee, a cheap coffee, and now a wife coffee.
It's hitting alone, on the associations, and on the hungry.
The thing is Metro's news.
You can order yourself for a wife or husband from Ore no Yome, my Finnish wife.
It's a waitress who pretends to be the client's mate.
"Poleso" is selected from the list before arriving at the cafe, and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is opposed to just an Essus and a bikini on her head, and her husband is in a tight ride.
The website provides a wife’s application for all information on length and weight to what type of pillow they prefer to sleep on.
As soon as 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: Attacks against vehicle security started to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in the sector, reports Intel’s release.
The Board is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
Researchers from ASRB will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB's findings.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting company, estimates that some 150 million vehicles are connected to the network by 2020.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75 per cent of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share online data.
We can and we need to improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Intel Security Director Chris Young.
With ASRB’s help, Intel can establish the best safety practices and support the view that cyber security is an important component in the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB Board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovations in data processing.
Ford Focus RS pays about €52 000 in Finland!
Fordin Focus RS has been expected for years as the moon rising.
Finally, the car begins to be on the horizon in Finland.

The main brand Kia introduced two novels in Frankfurt's car exhibition - such as the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth generation Sportage, where Kia intends to catch a larger wing from the ever growing street market, will certainly be more important than two novelties in Finland.
The new European design director, Gregory Guillaume, is more circular than before.
There's been a cent in the middle of axel and outdoors, and the car's going to cut the air more effectively.
The engine range is essentially unchanged, but it has been increased by 177 horse power to develop 1.6-litre turbos.
More Kia Sportagest and its performance and consumption are reported as closer to sales revenue.
We still have to wait for it, because we have a new Sportage coming in spring 2016.
Even before the year changed, our new Kia Optimats made it to our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of the upper middle-class buyers with better driving features, lower noise levels and higher quality equipment.
The start is obtained with 1,7-litre turbodesels and 2,0-litre petrol engines.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when Optima GT, equipped with a 2,0-litre turbo engine, comes alongside them.
During the same period of time, the sales of Optima farmer will begin.
Chisu's back on the stage. He's got a lot of balls on his back.
Singer Chisu is involved in the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
There's an open, open neck hole in the electric pants suit.
The house is a beautiful performance of the star of the singer's belt.
The whole thing is crowned with a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three - year break, a singer who became a mother - in - law has been punished with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to be a year old.
The singer published his first single in the new album in August.
After a long break, I'm not really excited about getting back on the stage and getting up to the public.
I've missed all the music-related work, the singer tells me.
Chisu will release a new album in a couple of weeks, while his fourth album is called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired you to do new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will think.
Kim Kardashian's masculinity is a little out of control, and now you see the chest.
True-tv beautiful Kim Kardashian gives the subject one after another.
He presents his pregnancy and chest equipment in unscrupulously sexy clothes, last night one hour in America when he and his sister Kourtney Kardashian left the marriage of Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the breasts.
It reveals the colourful bras under the dress in the flash of lightning lights.
Last time Kardashian was wearing an amateur maternity dress when he visited his friend at dinner parties in New York just a few days ago.
The house was highlighted by black overcrowded boots.
The third special maternity uniform is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when it was a pregnancy day.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model of Manon Leloup wanted to take the impression that the model world would be a clean glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary Speaking Dolls (Speaking dolls) where Leloup and his colleagues talk about the model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered the six loud truth behind the scenes of Leloup.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if during the previous period you would have posted in top planners' homes, the new season will begin again in Casting.
And every season will be new, fresh faces that will compete for work with the convents.
The models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take place in a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young, and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be insatiable.
New York and Paris are wanted jobs, but they are the most stressful.
It's not just one sort of weight.
Agent New York might ask for a drop of pounds, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
In fashion, models and designers are all together and act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks are over, the difference's gonna stink.
Models want this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but the fact is that everyone thinks the work is just displaying clothes.
They want to be their own person, too.
It makes them feel like they're actors with some kind of role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
The models you made last night at Tory Burch's show.
In New York, fashion weeks are being celebrated, where designers will reveal their collection next year.
Roope Salminen, who has changed her style, plays the most unknown autlanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen performs Antti Lautala in a film based on the early years of the Auslanta Association.
Lautala was founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtasen, but resigned from the association in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this film I'm playing 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughing.
I've never wanted to meet Antti before the illustrations because I want to make her my own interpretation.
The Antti is clearly unknown to people from that group, so I think it's good to learn only from the video.
I don't want to make an impression of a human being.
A man who trusts Roope Salminen and the Dogs Association is not going to play the role.
Punk-mangers come from the man according to nature.
The stars, stars and stars in the punk phase of the program must have been seen by many people, as well as if they've ever seen our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but we always go full.
During the year 1993-2004 the bassist Tuukka Temose, directed by us, was released today.
The group, known to the band, is presented to the public by quite unknown young actors.
Rummali Sipe Santapukkia performs Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a tip of his future plague last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he would prepare for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already released a picture of his new story on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to do for the film.
Roope, previously seen in the figs and jaws, has shaved his face to silo, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think in recent days about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees seeking to go to Europe.
Or is it worth telling me at all?
There is no need to speak out loud, a member of the SPR crisis team, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected, and, for example, they are not allowed to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can remain in the mind and distress, he says.
However, if the child has encountered or heard from refugees in TV news, it is worth talking about.
It is good to visit the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fear of a child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parents think he is afraid of.
You should not be afraid for nothing, even if you are anxious and afraid.
A smaller child closely follows the conduct of his parents.
If parents themselves remain calm during the debate, the child also experiences being safe.
Larger children are likely to run into discussion with refugees at school, with friends or on the Internet.
It is good for parents to talk to them about it if they are to think about it.
The fact is, not all people in the world are well.
Together with the children, parents can reflect on how this is seen in our family.
But in the end, do we think the world is a safe or safe place?
Parents may also have different educational aspects - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child gets a model on how to deal with the challenges facing life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social Psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Study your children to help the weaker"
End your own powers?
Still, you can be a good parent to your child.
It is difficult to control the Pallosalamaa hit by the blood.
Perttu Pohjola got a sweat on the Apilan Pallosalama in the middle of the attack.
It swept only profits and seconds until, at the end of July, a collapse occurred in Tampere's raves.
Since the slave was abandoned by the bottom, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a time to protect his protective device from a veterinarian.
The explanation for how it went out was clear in the seal.
The horse had an infection in the throat.
The disease wasn't the easy way to get out of it, but it took two meds to figure it out.
Since Apilan Pallosalama had to be in light motion, Northjola says that he was positive about the last race of the horse.
It was the second SE station after Taruntuvuu.
Apilan Pallosalama was under severe pressure when it could have been driven normally for just a few weeks.
At the end of these points, the small bend was understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a good race made steel for the Ori.
The sentence of the horse must have moved on from it, and I hope that it would also have become even.
Apilan Pallosalama has been called humor horses.
When you haven't had any fun, you could have thrown it fat without your disease.
On the good day, however, the Ori has been cut off by such a sham that the opponents have been wonderful.
At high speed, turtles can't cope with Pallosalamaa, where even warm-blooded rides can't get off.
There's a baseball drink in Vermo.
However, the difference is how Apilan Pallosalama agrees.
It's kind of hard at the moment of departure, and it might be a little bit difficult to get out of here, and it's like, "Oh, my God, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I hope the slave would be more calm than Turku's leaving.
When Apilan Pallosalama is in order, we can also come out of the bow, and we are going to drive it through victory, coach permission.
That's why you can't get rid of your dirty iPhone software.
Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programmes that come with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future, but not all of them.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own software from iPhone phones in the future, reports Tim Cook Buzzfeed’s interview with CEO Tim Cook Buzzfeed.
Apple's iPhone contains a series of programs that are relatively rare to use: for example FaceTime calls, magazinekioski, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Vinkits come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as an forced update to iPhone phones, even though it is only necessary for Apple’s smart watch owners.
Cook says that removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which iPhone applications in Apple work closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple's looking into it, because the company doesn't want to waste any memory space on the iPhone phones of users.
inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, i.e. 0.1 per cent of the year-on-year, Eurostat told us today by the EU Statistical Authority.
The rise in prices led to a downward decline in energy.
From a few weeks ago, Eurostat reviewed a slightly downward estimate of 0.2%.
In July, inflation was 0.2%.
So-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's preliminary estimate for base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy was 7.2 per cent lower in the euro area last month than one year ago.
In the whole of the 28 countries, average inflation in the EU was in zero in August.
In July the rise was 0.1 per cent.
In August, consumers' prices rose most from the euro countries, i.e. by 1.4 per cent.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU's harmonised price index.
In the euro area, inflation continues to be far from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB) which is an increase of 2% in the medium term.
On average, the ECB predicts inflation of 0.1% for the euro area for this year.
Next year, the increase will be up to 1.1%, and the new inflation forecasts it announced at the beginning of September will be announced by the central bank.
The US Fed is going to try and tighten up monetary policy next.
The US's next fall will start at its fastest in less than one year, but more definitely within three years after the country's central bank Fed takes up its interest rates again for a long time.
And the bottom line in the financial market begins before the next fall.
Fed has suggested that he will start raising interest, possibly by this week and by the end of the year.
Thus, the next recession can be hit as fast as possible by the autumn and the financial market course before that.
Or at least this happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets function as they used to be, and if they react to Fed's money acquisitions as they have done before.
Such conclusions have led to the strategies of the German bank Deutsche Bank's London market investigation, Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive long-term market and economic cycle investigation.
The bank distributed the Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its international clients last week.
The strategies developed by the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will start to raise interest rates or what will happen in the economy and in the market afterwards.
Instead, they present, by means of the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, how the economy and the market have previously behaved at and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they will examine which key economic and financial market variables are now on the same or another model as at the time of previous interest rates - and whichever is the case.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more horrific position to withstand interest increases than once before in the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession may not be a year.
The leaders who decided to decide about Fed's monetary policy and its subsequent launch have long been in the middle of the last summer and, for the first time, suggested that the time would start to be ripe to raise interest rates.
The first highlight for more than nine years can come this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on this matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised his so-called Fed funds control rate in June 2006.
At that time, for a relatively regular period of two years, it ended with a series of small 0.25 percentage points, at a time when Fed raised its interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%.
The financial market symptom began in 2007 with the most risky housing financing difficulties in the United States, and one year later, the financial crisis broke down as a global nightmare for the day of judgment.
The great recession took place in 2009.
Last time the financial markets and the real economy started to go slower than the previous Fed interest rates have typically happened.
Correspondingly, the trials were harder and more difficult than once in the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have covered the rises and declines of the world's largest economies, as well as the turnings of the financial markets since 1950 and in place from the beginning of the 1800s.
From the 1950s onwards, they will make clear the interest rates and their economic and financial implications.
The initial interest rate has taken less than one year, most often less than three years and on average less than three and a half years since the start of the recession.
The increase in the financial market has ended within one year and two from the start of Fed's interest rates.
Fed's shifted up and downed his steering rate after the early 1950s by a dozen different cycles.
In some respects, each time has been different from others, and the review is relatively limited, so it is unlikely that there will be any conclusion on the impact of the following interest rates.
The strategies remind me that this time many things are different.
Not just better.
Interest too long
Because of the crucial causes of the financial crisis, we may not find out without doubt even through decades of research.
However, three aspects of the crisis's leadership and its destruction, I think, are somewhat undisputed:
1) Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other major central banks of the world, in the 21st century, considered their steering interest to be too long too low.
They patched up the technokupus, and they also raised the next one.
2) Over the decades, the number of debt accumulated in different parts of the financial and real economy increased even more from the monetary policy effect of the central banks.
The largest debt bubble in economic history was born up to that time.
3) In particular, crazy debt financing, which was the most liquidised in the financial economy, was the biggest exchange of shares in real estate, bonds and commodities in most parts of the financial market so far.
However, it is unlikely that the financial markets that had risen to higher levels in the face of the ever more complex debt shortages were in a rare and unstable situation, when Fed and the other central banks were last driving up interest rates.
As a result of the debt structure, the valuation coupons could not last as long as they had started to raise interest rates and the cost of debt financing had gone up.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis and resulted in a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategies do not guess what will happen next, but give the nuclear issue by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now held their monetary policy even more lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) The debt has not been bad for a long time as it has been ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than expressed.
Consequently, the debt burden on the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now, in various parts of the economy, debt is much more severe than before or before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity issued by central banks in a deeper and cheaper manner has largely remained on the financial market and the main types of securities and assets have been reduced to the top or ever prior to the financial crisis.
And not only are the strategies of the lattice of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not recovered from the financial crisis and from the tens of years to the worst to the model that has happened before.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but in a similar way the pressures and risks of the financial markets are far greater than before the financial crisis, when Fed is going to press ahead to tighten up his funds.
Perhaps the picture of Albert Edwards' future of the French bank Socite General's strategic strategy is not as strange as it may suddenly seem.
He's been training the bank's international investor clients for the following full translations of Fed:
First, Fed raise interest rates, then the financial coupons break out, and soon, it's time for Fed to cut off the financial cuts with even bigger QE cash cuts.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) manufacturing computers and outputs will reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed at HP's business service party, the company says.
HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprises and HP Inc., focused on consumer pc machines and outputs in November.
HP had the highest number of employees in 2011, with 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records the non-reflecting costs of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce 25000-30000 employees.
Reductions by the consumer will remain at 3300 in three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries, with 60% of its employees in low cost countries in 2018.
The company tells us that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers will be responsible for more than 10 percent of its operating result.
In the second year, its three main customers accounted for 65% of the operating profit.

Yle: Minister Berner has worked for the government of a tax haven company
According to Ylen, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the board of tax haven companies.
According to above, so-called tax planning was linked to the company's activities.
It is a Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo company appointed as a board member, Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board.
Berner himself says he left a notice of resignation in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough that I've left a notice of separation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on an agreed timetable, says Yle in an interview.
Membership after merger
The Luxembourg company manages the ownership of the Swedish Kährs.
Kährs is a flooring manufacturer, who evaporated with the Finnish parking manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner worked for the Karelia-Upoflor Government in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs, as well as in Luxemburg.
According to above, Kährs’ ownership in Luxembourg is passed through a multi-ported ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted the membership of the government at Kährs' second largest owner's request.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the Karelia Upoflor government owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was contacted to find a partner in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to ensure that the interests of the Finnish family company’s capital were achieved.
It is important that we ensure that the income of the capital of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this connection, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership of the company does not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up for tax havens is due to the fact that Triton, the largest owner of Kährs, had already prepared a Luxemburg holding company for ownership.
Espoo opens the reception centre run by the company
Espoo Otaniemi opens the first reception centre provided by the company for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take over the first hundred inhabitants since this evening.
The number of seats can be increased within one week by up to 300-400 persons.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue Centre.
The activities are maintained by Luuna Oy, which is primarily responsible for the production of health care and medical care services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Service and Luuna Oy agree together, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STK prepares an alternative work-life blackmail package
STK will start preparing an alternative package for the blackmail of government working life.
The organization also wishes to see other employees' centre organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being paid in Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing the cost of work will then be restored.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola pointed out at a break in the organisation’s administration meeting to journalists.
Palola estimates that the Central Association of Business Life (EC) is not ready for discussions.
The economists of STK have calculated that the change security provided by the Government's Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if it's a part of a terrible enthusiasm to have a conversation if it's one-sided relationship with a hundred people.
Palola: Reconciliation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has called for alternative proposals by Wednesday, since then the government will be required to present a communication on its own package to the Parliament and to begin the preparation of reforms.
Palola did not take the view that the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a link between the government and it has been always constructive about him.
According to Palola, the staff's central organization on the field of STKK, especially Sunday's surgery is a painful place.
The organization requires the government to back up the forceful legislation to implement part of the blackmail.
According to the St.T.K., Palola does not say that an alternative package would be prepared with SDP.
The employees meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the work-life blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the remuneration of the first days of sickness is cut, the overemployment benefits are reduced, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays reduced.
The STK stresses that the central organisations have called on employees to express their minds, and that the purpose has not been to set up a strike.
The Fjäder in the scheme says he's in love with you.
Mr Fjäder, President-in-Office of the Plan, congratulates the STK's statement on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STK is now on the same lines as Akka, since there are options for government presentations in Akas.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in an alternative package, because without SAK the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
Mr Fjäder, President-in-Office of the Programme, hopes that the SAK led by Lauri Lyly will prepare the proposal as an option for surgery.
Antti Palolaan STK earlier said that it would prepare new proposals on Wednesday.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the scheme announced that it had long prepared its own presentation, which is ready to negotiate a five-percent competitiveness gap with the government of the country as an alternative to cutbacks.
The programme has been ready to negotiate all the time, and we have long written an alternative model for government presentations.
We are prepared to look at the terms of the service relationship as part of the agreement.
In response, we want security of change and working time banks," says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Akán lines, as STK had done before Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
The draft Bureau will meet at 15 a.m. on Thursday to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the common coal, the winters" - play bingo when speaking to Sipilä tonight
Green Left of the University of Tampere
Viva bingokuponki, Green Left of the University of Tampere.
Presidencies have previously held special speeches during the rebellion and wars in Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on the Ylen channels on Wednesday at 21.05 p.m.
In order to seek the corresponding Prime Minister's previous speech, we must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he held a famous radio talk, which meant the beginning of the rebellion in Mäntsälä.
After that, the President and ministers held several radio calls during the winter and after war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held, instead of President Mauno Koivisto, a New Year's speech, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen stopped on television with the strike of train protectors.
Single phone, monarchist meins
The talk has raised criticisms and guesses of what I'm about to do.
On Twitter, President of the Left Association, Paavo Arhinmäki said that "The Sipilä could speak of the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, when the talk could also be discussed".
According to the Greens Ville Niinistö, "one phone has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
In Facebook, the Erkki Judgment of the SDP condemned that "monarchist melinks: the Prime Minister will tell the people what is best for it".
The president of the SDP, Antti Rinne, appealed to the Sipilä dialogue: "I have spent six months in elections.
It's not the only thing the Prime Minister has in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What is the fear of @juhasipila?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and will take about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it is commented on the direct broadcast by Mr Lauri Lyly, President of the SAK, and Mr Jyri Hähkämér, CEO of the EC.
I've been criticised for presenting Sipila's speech.
We would consider it, and we said that it is a public service task to promote the comprehensive public administration of Finland, a line from Ylen's Director, Ismo Silvo Yle.
It's like we at Tammelian's time.
The speech has also raised loose ends.
The dinner that came evening will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be covered and dressed as their best.
My mom puts on the nicest monster, and my dad's making a tie in her neck.
At nine o'clock, we'll be slowing down to television before we were back in Tammelian', by blogger Saku Timonen.
"Do Prime Minister Sipila also ask why, in his speech, there are millionaires in the Finnish government who hide their capitals, who draw up laws of mercy for their fellow taxpayers and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut off when the state is over?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left of the University of Tampere, Viva.
It's been published on Facebook by some kind of bingo.
Can we hear about the same boat, the common coal, the living in debt and the team man tonight?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21.05 p.m., it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal for the exclusion of al-Assad
Over three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer by which President Bashar al-Assad of Syria could have given up power, tells President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the United Nations Ambassador in Russia proposed a plan for al-Assad to disappear in style after some time.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian Ambassador, Vitali Tshurkin, in a bilateral debate, listed three points of the plan: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and the abandonment of al-Assad had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we are able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I did there and he said sit down, Alas, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari will remember Guardian's interview.
Diplomats don't comment
The Ahtisaari tells us that Tshurkin's message was transmitted to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate to the press, but Ahtisaari says there are no two words.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on the arguments made by Ahtisaari, but they said that, at that time, Al-Assad's troops had already committed several massacres and the main opposition groups refused all agreements that he would have been in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, views the words of Ahtisaari, as according to his experience, Russia was not at any time prepared to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
I was in the middle of saying that Tshurkin spoke with the Moscow council.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speech, I would have answered that I wanted to hear the same President, Vladimir Putin, so I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, in that case, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's spear to hold power with some of Al-Assad's supporters.
The refugee power to do our own work
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
Over 11 million people have had to escape their homes for war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The escape from Europe is what we have done.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying for the invoice that we yourself caused, says Ahtisaari to the newspaper.
Agency for Asylum Applicants with a knock-on to the Tower
The FMC, designed by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be set up in Turin.
The Centre would be set up in the tower building in the city center empty.
The Ministry of Interior has sought a place suitable for the need to improve management of refugee flows from the Swedish border.
Helsingin's messages announced on Tuesday that the council would have already decided to present a school building as a state solution to the Ministry.
According to Saul Hüppinen, Vice-President of the Tower City Council, that is not true.
When the whole council was not assembled and some of the people wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council to decide on this matter next Monday, he would specify it to the STT.
There were 36 delegates from 43 at the meeting.
13 delegates were opposed to the organisation centre.
On that basis, you could expect the decision to be positive, Mr. Good says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city received contact on Monday, and it was reacted quickly.
The Joint Society could be estimated to have 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has been asked to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is about a hundred feet from the border, so that would work in that sense, says Nousianinen.
Sipilä still hopes for an alternative from the labour market to blackmail
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) only a part of the government's efforts to calculate the cost of work would be carried out by the public holiday money.
However, the government is happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners are able to agree on such an option.
Sipilä told the journalists in Parliament that she had not been in contact with the social partners.
Nor did he know how seriously the organizations are looking for substitute methods for the tensions of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the whole package.
In Sipilä’s view, taking the money off would be a way of dealing with almost all employees in the same way as, for example, a Sunday surgery proposed by the government.
Labour market organisations could agree on the operation of holiday money because they have been recorded instead of law in collective agreements.
This is the view of the government next Wednesday on the House of Parliament on the tensions of working life in the Government's communication.
It is true that the proposals made by organisations should be known before.
This isn't the end line either.
The legislative work will then start to move, i.e. the train will be on the move and will be more difficult all the time.
It's a very long time.
It won't take long in such matters, if there is a will, Sipila formed.
The government's publication last week has, among other things, a change in the list of stolen and helatoristas into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the remuneration of the first days of sickness will be cut, the overemployment benefits will be split, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays reduced.
The reforms are being implemented as a forceful piece of legislation over trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
In view of the activities carried out by employees' central organisations, on Friday large-scale representations have been organised, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
The Dwarf Council approved the extension of the juice room warehouse
The Board of Governors approved unanimously but slightly the extension of the warehouse of Nordic Koivu Oy’s hall.
The criticism was that the project was bigger and more expensive than originally discussed.
It's also a busy schedule.
It was also slightly wondered that the need to order was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the extension of the stock at 400-450 sqm was approved as an investment programme, but the funds will be decided at the time of the interim report.
Another item on the agenda was the investment of €150,000 to €200 000, but the technical director Erkki Iconen said that the price is estimated to be €300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis that it would bring employment and tax revenues to the municipality.
The municipality does not have a risk as the company pays the investment as a rental, Vesa Väistö (see).
Even in the Karelian language, the place in Joensuu
The city government suppled its previous strong position on bringing farm - speaking street name signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important, and it is right to maintain the livestock tradition throughout the country.
Joensuu does not declare itself a capital city in the language of the herd, because there is no historical basis for it and the language of the herd is not an inherent part of the identity of the area.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastern savolainen fractures.
After a new decision, there will be no street name signs in the town centre.
However, on a case-by-case basis, the city of Joensuu is also ready to use the language of the herd, for example, in the information tables and in the marketing of tourism.
The same view of the city favours all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single-lingual municipality, it is also worth taking a generous approach to the use of the livestock language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in Northern Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still specific in the country, as is the image of Joensuu as a whole forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be used to benefit from a wide range of markets in the region.
The derailment of train connections reduces the vitality of the county
Circumventions of train connections hit the county with a strong hand on its vitals.
Transport links directly affect the economic life and competitiveness of the county.
And it seems to be possible to live and work here at all, the Mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also highlights air transport, which has also been on several occasions in the report.
From the point of view of the whole region, it is important that we do not manage to reduce the scope of government measures, as is now taking place.
The impact of the termination of these transport connections on employment, for example, should be seen in the Karjainen's emphasis.
The deterioration of transport links poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland as regards attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here are, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, the headmaster of the University of Eastern Finland Jukka Mönkkönen says.
He points out that poor transport connections also affect a researcher community that is very mobile and travels much because of research.
The recruitment director, Marko Junkkarinen, says that it is already difficult to market the university towards Western Finland because the links are weak in a cross-border direction.
At the moment, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
On the other hand, about 10-20 per cent is from New Zealand, which is partly explained by direct rail connection.
Joensuu became one of my lines for Siu's war
The view of the City Government of Joensuu on the regional Siu sote project is apparently unanimous, but there is one among my ring voices.
Ms Pentti centralsalo (cf., in the picture) presented the government at a meeting on Monday about abandonment of the whole project, but his presentation was unprofitable.
The Government approved the proposal for a decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give a final statement of the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train trip from Kotka to Kouvolaa ends next year
The transport of passenger trains from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, even less than one train shift.
There will be changes in passenger trains between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train crew is left out, but still five more days will get from Kouvola to Kotka and vice versa.
The reduction is due to State savings measures.
The purchase of rail transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely terminated.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They enter into force on 27.3.2016.

The situation was born in Turin on Ketotie at six o'clock on Tuesday night.
There's an old double-storey wooden house in the area that doesn't have any ladders on the roof.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb down the roof of the house along the mass of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
The result was that the others swept from the place and the passers alarmed the rescue facility to assist with the bets of the last roof safely returned to the surface of the earth.
FedEx's net sales turnover fluctuations, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx announced the weak outcome of the last quarter. The transport sector left its results down throughout the year due to a decrease in demand for freight services and increased costs for land transport.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that he would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
The company's stock fell by about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the opening of the actual trade on Wednesday.
The FedEx forecast is $10.40 to $10.90 for the financial year ending in May. The forecast shows a decrease of 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to FactSett's study, analysts predicted $10.84.
On average, the forecast has deteriorated despite an increase of 4,9 % in prices, which is due to enter into force on 4 January. Additional payments on land transport of heavy or large sized shipments will enter into force in November.
The company is still waiting for results from the previous year due to cost cuts, increased turnover and growth in online trade.
The president and CEO, Fred Smith, stated that the company has been performing in a very poorer economic situation, which has, in particular, tried production and global trade.
The plans for the recruitment of seasonal workers were announced on the day following the announcement by the competitor of the UPS of its plans to employ approximately the same seasonal workers as last year, i.e. between 90,000 and 95,000.
In the fourth quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx’s operating profit was USD 692 million, which means an increase of six per cent.
The result per share was $2.42, which means that 12 analysts in Zacks Investment Research were left behind in the forecast of $2.44.
Net sales rose by five per cent to $12.3 billion.
According to the six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, turnover was expected to be EUR 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has tried to reduce the number of international Class 1 shipments, which is why the company's Express unit has been on the ground.
The strong growth in the online trade has confirmed the outcome of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the net sales of land transport grew by 29 per cent, but the operating profit showed an increased cost of large-scale shipments and insurance.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic charges, while the return on freight business decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the opening of the real trade, FedEx's stock exchange rate had decreased by $3.55 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the share reached a decrease of 11 % from the average of the year and 17 % below the highest quotations recorded on 11 June.
This week, the heads of the Central Bank of the United States of America will meet at the most expected meeting for years, and the group will sit on a diameter of eight-metre Egyptian wooden table to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
There is a wall painting on the wall of the central bank's decorative, double-layered meeting room.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank and his colleagues, Janet L. Yelen, must put the state's financial interests ahead of all others.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: maximum employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, since the Grand Land, the central bank’s management has noted the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
On Thursday, the central bank is expected to report whether the U.S. economy is ready to start the withdrawal from the unexpected irritation offered by short interest rates close to zero at the end of 2008.
Although most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, the recent fall in the financial markets can already be prepared by the prudent central bank officials to reinvigorate the increase in volatility by raising the reference rate of federal taxes – even in the quarter of the percentage point.
The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important in their practical monitoring," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economicist of Stifle Nicolas & Co.
"I believe, however, that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty of the global market is to give sufficient reason to wait yet", Piegza continues.
Those who have thought about it do not agree with what the central bank is planning, which is already causing nervousness in itself.
About half of the economials in Bloomberg’s study were exhausted this week’s increase in interest rates.
However, in financial markets, the central bank is expected to have only 30% chance of raising, and according to the key indicator.
If the central bank lifts its voting rate, the stock exchange rates may be reduced unless the decision-makers lighten up the attack by promising another raise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index struck 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599.85.
"The background of the increase was the expectations that the central bank would keep the key interest rate stable this week," said Moody's Capital Markets Research Group's chief economist John Lonski.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest at this stage," he said.
"If this were to happen, the central bank should carefully consider how to keep the hands of those operating on the financial markets without any stress."
Second, the experts stated that by raising interest rates, it would be possible to calm the financial markets and remove uncertainty as to when the central bank would operate.
Only a month ago, the central bank seemed to be agitated by increasing interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step towards tightening financial conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Over the spring and early season, Yelle has said that she was looking forward to raising interest this year — despite the need for economic progress, according to the liberals.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent in the last month, which is now at its lowest for seven years and close to the level that the central bank calculates as full employment.
Wage income seems to be tightening
Although inflation continued to fall below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the central bank’s decision-makers stated that the key reason for this is the sharp temporary effect of oil prices.
"The economy can do even at higher interest rates, and it needs them, as long as they take into account the tight situation on the labour market," said Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However , the financial markets around the world were not stunned last month when China devalued its currencies.
Dow Jones' industrial average peaked up to 16 percentage points in May's record height and investors feared that the Chinese economic downturn would also affect global growth.
The markets have been squeezed this month, and Dow Jones has now fallen by almost 10% of May peak readings.
The fall of the market means that the ECB’s decision-makers will be further altered by considering the withdrawal of the steering interest rate.
"In spite of what happened in the financial markets and what news of the deterioration in the Chinese economy has taken place in recent weeks", UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate’s senior researcher and former central bank official Stephen D. Oliger said.
He now believes that the central bank will wait at least one month to be able to deal with the effects.
"There is great uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy; there is little reliable information on the situation since the recent development of the Chinese economy," Olier said.
The healing of the global economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so it should in principle not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential body in the world's monetary economy.
The impact of the central bank has been huge in recent years.
In 2013, just a hint from Ben S. Bernanken that the Central Bank could narrow down its scope led to upsettings all over the world.
In today's world, markets and economies are closely intertwined, and in addition to monitoring the world's developments, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts so that it has a good overall picture of the global economy.
"The decision-making process of the Keskusbank is more art than science", says Zachary Karabel, Director of the Global Strategy for Investmentnet Inc.
In this month, President Jefferson Lacker of the Regional Central Bank said that the Central Bank had previously overreacted financial markets that do not seem to be in contact with the fundamental pillars of the economy.
A member of the Federal Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee) has called for an increase in the steering interest, as an example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The economic crisis in Asia led to the decision of the Central Bank at three meetings to calculate the reference rate of 0.75 percentage points, although only limited to identifiable penalties for US economic growth", Lander said.
A year later, the central bank reversed the decision.
"The Bank should set monetary stability first in a major crisis, as in the economic collapse of 2008," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England Interest Committee.
The last thing he's ever done is not even coming up with that situation," he said.
"There is no reason to fear the rise of the women because of the shocking market," added Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability.

The Brazilian Rio Grande Children's Medical Association promotes good diets for breast-feeding people
The Brazilian Rio Grande Children's Medical Association SPRS has developed a blinding way of teaching breast-feeding women the importance of proper dieting, and they are presented with pictures of babies that are breast-feeding, with pictures of unhealthful food.
Human breast milk consists of protein, fat, vitamins and carbohydrates, so the baby receives all the food it needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Due to the extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 kilograms.
In addition to increasing calories, the new study shows that further changes to diet should be made.
The Texas Baylor College of Medical Professor Robert Waterland's recent study revealed that a pregnant woman's healthy diet can affect the baby's genes and protect the baby from tumour development.
Unfortunately, a healthy diet was found to have negative effects on the baby’s immune system.
The biggest viewers at Seven Sunris, even though Nine is trying to get the lead on Today's Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson would go to Canberra for the morning program of the post-elections of the Liberal Party, which did not, however, improve the numbers of the Today's viewers.
The Nine Channel's morning program was sent from the capital by Malcolm Turnbull's deported Tony Abbott.
The first morning programme of the competing channel created by David Koch and Samantha Armytage was sent from London. Special broadcasts from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun are also sent over a week.
The distance did not appear to have any relevance for Australian TV viewers, since Sunrise had an average of 397 000 viewers in five capital cities in the country, and Today's programme was 339 000 viewers.
Today’s viewer figures rose slightly from last Monday (317 000) to Tuesday (283 000) but remained reading last Thursday (343 000).
Today has caught a distance to Sunris in the last few months.
In August, Today had a average of 318 000 viewers, Sunday had 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has reached an average of 349 000 viewers and 314 000 viewers on Today.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
The wind changes affect Parliament more this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

The significant novelty of Seven had 800 Words series with the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The novel drama tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children, and the new series reached the peak of 1 219 000 viewers.
The critics have suspected whether Thomson would be enough to star the set alone without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibson.
Last night, according to the audience figures, the answer is clearly positive.
Sevenin The X Factor kept its strong position on 1,136,000 viewers. Series were brightly overthrown by The Block (838 000) and TBL Familys (726 000).
Seven’s The Chase Australia has captured the audience in a variety of ways.
On average, 446 000 viewers were followed by the first half hour of the series on the Andrew O'Keefen plot (17.00-17.30).
On the second half-hour (17.30–18.00), the number of viewers rose to 623,000, which was more than Eddie McGuiren Hot Seattle (613 000).
On Monday night, the Chase Australia had a average of 520 000 viewers, and the other half gathered great 720 000 viewers.
The number of Hot Set's viewers was 620 000.
The Chase Australia’s second night viewer figures showed Nine that Hot Seattle would pass by at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minten who couldn't challenge the McGuir series.

The final three believe that Sam Wood really is the bachelor of dreams — but who does the man choose?
Did the secret come out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have deliberately revealed the choice of the grandson of dreams.
The final choice of dream bachelor, Sam Wood, has been a well-preserved secret.
Three remaining women do not say a word of who has received the last rose from a young man.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk, Lana Jeavons-Fellows' moods before one of the three was dropped off.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women said that Wood was a perfect man, and women praised the man's sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness, and considered him as a suitable partner for themselves.
When women were asked who Wood would be the most appropriate partner if the last rose did not hit its own point, their answers could give an indication of who would take the boy’s heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay himself the most appropriate partner for Wood.
Everything has been easy between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood since the beginning.
"When I came into the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam fit well together. This feeling has been maintained throughout the program," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has feet on the ground, and he is a really fun company," Markoski added.
"I have seen them together, and I must admit that there is chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she's a good partner and Sam Wood.
Mackay told me he's been up on a hometown date last week that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is not just a race, and now I'm putting our relationship in full," Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should be elected if he didn't choose him, she answered with appreciation:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like the other girls as much, "Snezana and Lana are even."
A bachelor of dreams on the Ten Channel on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayley has several options for starting the NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Haynes in this modified United States. Several others were also interested in the man after the most impressive open training day of last year.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice appears to have hit the button.
Some trainers would have liked Hayne's bench, as the man visited the Australian rugby country team on the lines. Hayne made a fool to the return team to win on Tuesday from Minnesota, reading 20-3.
However, Tomsula showed her trust in Hayne and gave her a new chance to return her flight, and the coach held Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued her line in the dress box after the game.
He didn't run the incomers in front of the rest of the team. He encouraged them.
Tomsula also defended Hayne publicly at the press conference after the game.
Special editor of 49ers, Cam Inman reports that Hayne was also encouraged by the special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget that she had failed her capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne is snooping in the first quarter of the game against Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and his Australian fan forces had been waiting for another man from the NFL debyty.
After the failure, Hayne left the field hundreds of times and later told Hamish and Andy of the 2DayFM 104.1 channel that he could not have imagined the worst beginning of his NFL career.
"It hurts, and we have to move forward," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the mistake of debuting in the State of Origin series in 2007, when his input in his own territory opened the place for Queensland.
The whole experience was still incredible for a 27-year-old.
Hayne published a photo in Instagram, where he postes together with fans and Australian flags.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mihail Hodorkovski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at the airport in Siberia, under threat.
President Vladimir Putin was sentenced to Hodorkovski, a man-owned oil company, Jukos was deported and his work in favour of democracy was restricted.
Four dead policemen shot in rubber bulletin protestors in Nepal
Four people died in South Nepal, the official source told me on Wednesday, and the police shot a bunch of rubber people in an alleged protest against the new constitution of the country, and there were four-year-old boys among the victims.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in Rupandeh district, about three hundred kilometers from the capital of Katmandus.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, over 1,000 protestors were gathered outside the police station, some throwing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used tear gas and set fire to the air before the rubber bullet was shot.
He said twenty cops and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which can kill, but which are generally considered a less destructive alternative, suddenly so deadly.
It was the most recent conflicting weeks of continued protests in the southern plains of Nepal, where, according to the Madhesi tribe, new provinces based on the new Constitution would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in Western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe requires its own state.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are policemen, have died in violent cannons since 10 August,
When four major political parties signed an agreement on the distribution of land into the countryside, this is an important step towards a new Constitution, but it is very sensitive in Nepal, where the administration has been centralised for centuries.
The new Constitution has been working on since 2008, but the legislative process has accelerated since thousands of people died in the shocking earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted on the Constitution clauses this week, and according to the authorities, the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
Hurricane centre of NHC: 60 % probability for cyclone south of Cape Verde
From a wide low pressure area about 560 km from the southernmost parts of Cape Verde, a 60% probability of developing tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, reported the United States National Hurricane Center (Native Hurricane Center).
According to the Miami Air Sciences Institute, the centre of clear low pressure is also located in the middle of Cape Verde and the Little Antillies. It can also develop into tropical cyclone by 60% during the next two days.
Google intends to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc. (GOGL.O) announced that it would launch a campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian aid organisations that will help thousands of people who have escaped war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced a donation campaign in their blogs in a particularly personal way.
Instead of leading, Google's employee, Rita Masoud, started the campaign by telling us about his own experiences, and he was only seven years old when he fled from Kabul with his family.
"We traveled in the dark on a train and on a bus and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
As the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has hit many families in similar situations, there is an urgent need for help.
Donations are addressed to non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children ry and UN refugee organisation.
After donations have been collected at Gogle.com/refugeerief via $5 million, Google promises to donate a corresponding amount, which means that the total amount is 11 million.
The European refugee crisis is then the worst of the Second World War, and the situation is exacerbating, in particular, Syria's four-year civil war, which has caused more than four million people to flee their homes this year.
War must also be escaped from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from muscle surgery
According to the new study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from muscle surgery for at least five years.
It is too early to say, however, whether type 2 diabetics are mildly overweight after surgery, longer than those receiving surgery-free treatment.
"It takes time to get the death data", Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in the carnal surgery, discussed the new research in the JAMA Surgery magazine.
For muscle surgery, i.e. bariatric surgery, the stomach is reduced by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be an effective form of treatment in type 2 diabetes. However, most of the studies have concerned sick overweight subjects with a body weight index (BMI) of at least 35.
The weight index shall indicate the weight and length in which the normal value is 18.5 to 24.9.
When the weight index is more than 25, the person is overweight and the weight index of more than 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers at the Thai Min-Sheng Hospital used data collected from 2007 in a study comparing two methods of carnivorous surgery, gastric bypass surgery and hive surgery, type 2 diabetes treatment with mildly fat people.
After muscle surgery, the average body weight index fell from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The body weight index of patients treated without surgery was maintained at 29 hours.
Patients treated with surgery had a total improvement of 36% and a partial improvement of 28%.
In the treatment group, only 1% and only 2% of patients were treated with diabetes.
The study also showed that blood pressure, triglycerides and severe LDL cholesterol were better in the surgical group.
In addition, investigators followed patients with haemoglobin A1c, reflecting the development of blood glucose levels.
According to researchers, the recommended level of haemoglobin A1c is less than 7 %.
After surgery, haemoglobin A1c averaged from 9% to 6%.
In the treatment group, the value was maintained at around 8 %.
However, the study group, led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu, did not show a reduction in mortality in five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different surgery methods.
During the fifth year, weight loss was higher in the gastric bypass surgery group compared to the hive surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the decrease in body weight index was higher (7.4 and 5.1), and the decrease in haemoglobin A1c levels (3.1 % and 2.1 %).
However, according to Blackstone’s Swedish study, working at Phoenix University of Arizona College of Medicine, surgery treatment will bring life-long workers.
In a Swedish study, the risk of mortality in fat patients who had a stomach bypassed was reduced by 29% over 15 years compared to the conventional treatment group.
However, although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, Blackstone stated that individuals with a weight index below 35 would benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important finding of the study, as it says that surgery is safe in the lower weight index group, and it does not increase the risk of loss or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the weight index is between 27 and 30.
"We wait too long for people to begin to take the situation seriously," said the researcher.
"When genetic changes are accumulated in the human body, which expose fat and diabetes, it is truly difficult to reverse the situation."
"All cannot enter Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is unable to receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama has stated, and he believes that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibet's Buddhism has called for the end of violence in refugees' countries.
The Dalai Lama discussed the refugee crisis during his visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama spoke at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity must be placed ahead of individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that although the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is to be admired, it is not enough in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," the Dalai Lama said in her speech.
Although the Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their efforts in the event of a crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"The provision of thousands of refugees is a wonderful act, but at the same time there are long-term solutions and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education", the Dalai Lama stressed.
"We must finally consider how we can reduce the killing in these countries.
Power must be reduced.
Power has never solved problems," he added.
Furthermore, when talking about violence, the Dalai Lama commented on George Bush's actions during the September 11 terrorist attacks and claimed that, in response to the terrorist attack, the United States had established an uncontrollable chain of events.
"After 11 September, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would arise through violence.
I know his purpose was good, but he was confident about the means of force that had unpredictable consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Handicrafted swallowing cases in children quadrupled in four years
According to Georgia's Poison Center, poisoning centers around the United States account for their strong levels of alcohol in almost four-fold the number of children under 12 years of age from 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the leader of Georgia's poisoning centre, exposure to poisoning centres in children under 12 years of age increased from 3 266 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly accessible to children, and unfortunately some of the children are first aided," Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink by purpose, some to impress their friends and some of the social media.
There are teenagers in YouTube videos who drink disinfectant because of cheap humala.
Young people are told to mix alcohol into a disinfectant in order to get stronger drinking.
Smaller children can be attracted to the smell of the gloves.
"The kid doesn't think the substance's bad," Lopez said.
"A large part of attractive handmade products is just scattered.
There are handmade products of mansica, grapes and orange, which appeal to children."
The alcoholic strength by volume of disinfectants shall be between 45 % and 95 %.
For young children, a small amount can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcohol content of the clinic is very high," Stephen Thornton, medical director of the University Hospital of Kansas, told Fox 4 channels in Kansas City.
"No one would leave a whisky for children, but if the hand disinfectant products are often left to children, they quickly get a large amount of alcohol."
Six-year-old Nhaija Russell recently enjoyed four locusts of mansiccan productions at school, and the girl was delivered for first aid.
"The alcohol content of a girl was 179, which is twice the limit of adult humor," says the doctor who treated her at Chris Ritchey Atlanta, the Gwinnet Medical Center.
Nhaijah sopered and couldn't walk when he was brought to first aid.
The doctors followed her condition over the night in a separate child hospital for brain damage, for she had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol," Ritchey told.
"Your account was really scary," said Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott to CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and disinfectants in addition to the need to move your hand to non-captive children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are linked to deaths.
In 2013, two ontarians died after swallowing hands containing toxic substances that had not been reported.
The health authorities considered that the product contained a lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter was reported as active substance in the product description.
According to the police report, three fourth-class students in the northern part of the state of New York planned in January to kill a "bad" teacher by putting antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to the concepts and denied it to be brought into the classroom.
The police thought that the past plan was meaningless and urged the school to exercise discipline.
The rumor: does not disapprove in the Celtic lines
Griffith's a little out of control for the Celtic team, while Deila admits that the team is not all right, but believes that it's going to be all right.
Hearts close to the SFA against Neilson's punishment, and Warburton takes care of January transfers so that the team's unity is not affected.
Aberdeen's neck in Celtic five points
The first half of ADAM Rooney's punishment brought Aberdeen a little victory over Hamilton at the Pittodrie Stadium. The victory brought Aberdeen five points away from Celtic.
Griffiths is downplaying his speech.
The Griffiths have ignored the insanity in the Celtic lines. According to their words, Griffiths and his team are not subject to observation as they prepare to meet the Dutch serial leader.
"I don't have any pressure on us, and I think the players are waiting to meet.
The Dutch need an old Scottish team – de Boer
The former Rangers' middle field player and Dutch country teamer Ronald de Boer have stated that the interest of Dutch football fans in Celtic has been stolen because they are no longer allowed to follow the double-crossings of Celtic and Rangers.
De Boer, a team leader in Ajax, said: "There are no higher points in Celtic's games in the world.
Because Rangers is no longer involved."
"It's not just the Rangers' return we're talking about here.
We're talking about Old First.
The Dutch need a double fight between the teams.
The Old Firm games have huge tensions, and they are also interested in outside Scotland's borders."
I'll take care of the situation, Deila assures me.
Mr Deila admits that Celtic is having difficulty, but the Norwegian bullet assures us that the situation will change.
The lost association of Malmö fell from the Masters' league and lost ten players to Aberdeen, which now has five points of lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic has had difficult episodes before, and we'll get up again," Deila said.
"We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it causes many people to hate or feel sad.
We have to move on, too, but we have to move on.
We urgently need the support of Celtic supporters, as it will significantly strengthen players.
The common spirit is now very important."
Warburton Careful in January players' transfers
Although only a few weeks ago, the Rangers bomb Mark Warburto pointed out that he was in a position to play in January, he took caution in the transfer round and said he wanted to compromise the unity of the team.
"The players' transfers in January differ significantly from summer transfers", Brentford's ex- coach said.
"The players associated with the team in summer will be able to get used to the team before the beginning of the season, which has been successful in our membership in this period.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary players can do more harm to the team than benefit."
Michu, who thinks about living at the end of Celtic
Mr. Michu, an attacker of Swansea, has been associated with Celtic's hand-in-hand calls, which in turn has suggested that he should retire after the end of the Swans agreement.
A 29-year-old michu has been an agitated ankle for years, and he did not succeed in getting a move from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for the SFAs about Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team eventually lost 3-2. The defenseman's red card was cancelled later. It's already the third Collum red card in eight months, which will be cancelled.
Neilson, however, remains behind his words. "I did not question honesty, but I did not comment on the performance.
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The Griffiths were snooped when a man gave his losers some delicious songs about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in pubs in the Edinburgh Roseburn region before the Edinburgh local fight in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local fight in the house, and the atmosphere was intense," said the attacker. "I can assure you that I will not go back to Tynecastle except in the Celtic lines."
Tannadice Management Team believes in Dundee United Training Management – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures me that the Dundee United leadership can make the situation better.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We're gonna get the boys ready for the fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes welcomes Hamilton's victory with a dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen had to be desperate against Hamilton in front of his seventh consecutive overpower, and that at the top of his neck, Aberdee caught five points in Celtic, and that it was a compliment to Adam Rooney's punishment in the first half of the world.
"There is no cup or league winner team that would not have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment will increase in Scotland, in the British island
The number of unemployed people in the UK increased by 10 000 at the same time.
According to the Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent, while it was 5.5 per cent in the UK as a whole.
The number of people working in Scotland is 12 000 less than three months earlier.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent in the quarter, while the average employment rate in the UK is 73.5 per cent.
The Scottish Minister for Affairs David Mundoll commented on recent figures: "The long-term plan of management has established the basis for a strong economy."
Almost a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to maintain it as part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: and unemployment has decreased.
Why am I following the execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, unless there is a legal basis for the withdrawal, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, what I do not wish, I will be sitting in the execution room of the State Penitentiary of Oklahoma when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
In January, I received an invitation by the best friend of the man, and despite my shock, I replied yes.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why did I do it?
I agreed because I thought I could tell the truth story about the death penalty.
The angle of sight would be unique.
Journalists will be able to monitor executions in the United States, and as applications are more than available, participants will be selected on the makaber.
Oklahoma has reduced suppliers from 12 to five.
The selected executions will follow moderately.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends. I've created a man with a personal relationship because we've spoken on the phone several times over months, and one visit lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I cannot be present in both the witness and the reporter's capacity, so I must not be allowed to take the memory card and pen to make notes.
I just have to try to put the details on my mind.
I was accused of endangering neutrality on Twitter by an occult reporter.
"The idea of a family is this:
When you tell the story of the condemned in a pleasant way, you will get close to him."
I gave the reporter a different opinion.
The supplier woman admitted that she could have formulated her words more carefully, but still considers my actions to be wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what I'm writing, and even if he's trying to order, I wouldn't.
I've told him that he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international supplier who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity promotes a movement against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information on this subject, you can listen to my podcast broadcast.
I am not going to repeat the details in this connection.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Trees was murdered would help him to commit a crime.
However, I believe that it is very likely that Mr. Glossip has not committed a murder.
I definitely believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I'm following his execution.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
An unbiased description can be found in other suppliers' cases.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die for nothing.
He was dragged from the Canning River after the police hunt.
Officer Canning Vale remained dry when he dragged him up from Canningjoe.
An escape attempt by a Perthian man to get down into a deep, mutated water, and a police officer who was a few feet away got his grounded back on a dry land.
On Tuesday, Canning Vale police received a call from an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When he arrived, the police found a suspect trying to punish the police by heading to the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"A man standing in the water reported that he would not come out of the water and called the police to get him," the senior sergeant Shandell Castledine told.
Officer Lachlan Perhavecia’s baptism did not attract him, so he chose a safer tactics — a negotiation.
Once again, the attempt to make a person look after the amusing ways," Sergeant Castledine said.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is an impressive example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car in order to avoid a police blast and tried to swim across Swan River.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the tempus inspired the locals to design Ben Cousins.
According to Peter Moody, the contractors tried to spy on him, and he's threatening to stop competing.
Peter Moody's prosecution of Racing Victoria's contractors is being recorded last year, and he threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that the contractors and Racing Victoria's disobedience department have personally attacked him, and the rejection of Lady Tatai's recent treatment on the day of the race was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to work for racing. Moody has been in a difficult situation when we found the Kobolt in the Lidar sample, and the man couldn't explain the finding.
Moody has kept his tongue in custody for a year and a half and a half, and he did not want the charges to affect a bitter man.
"I wasn't going to raise it up. I thought about it for a long time, but sometimes frustration is going to go off with a one-time drop," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"I have to react and accept the consequences, and now I have to accept the state after I opened my mouth.
I'm gonna go home and sleep well.
I want to go upright, and I want the horse owners to believe I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I'm no longer a horse coach.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in the Racing.com interview, where he told me about the integrity department spying companies in his stable.
"Six months ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job at my stable for spying on my actions. I tell him when I asked for his name," Moody told Racing.com.
"They obviously believe I'm a cheater.
If so, they should present the evidence, for I have not been caught of anything unauthorized.
Robert Roulston, current president of the RVL, David Moodie and current CEO of the RVL, Bernard Saundry, were aware of the activities then and now.
Should I consider the situation to be a personal driver?
Should the RVL take real action and hold responsibility for the situation in the sector to non-trainers?
Do you think I'm a bad guy?
Do you really think I'm a bad guy?
Maybe that's what many people think.
Maybe I should still get my training license and push me away from my duties, and there's no doubt that I'm going to get many people to think that.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, it's sad.
It's really sad.
I pressure them to make their own decisions.
My family supports me, and I can retreat."
The long - lasting investigation of Lidar’s cobolt values and the recent rejection situation brought the coach’s frustration at last so that he threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the unbeatable master, Black Caviar, who described the day-to-day treatment rule as ridiculous after the horse's feet had been set against the rules of the clay roll.
"The service is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for it," Moody said.
"A person belonging to my family misreaded the clay on the horse's foot.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done last day, and that's what happened.
But it happened on the day of the race."
Moody can be expected to have a three-month ban on anti-ruled clay treatment, which the organisers have begun to deal with.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but here it has gone too far," Moody said.
Arrested escaped from Cobra's crash site
The police have arrested a guy who ran away from the crash site this weekend.
The biker was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and he was seriously injured by a car to hit him on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man who drove the car escaped the place and left behind to help the injured cyclists.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia reported to the Shepparton Police Department.
A man is likely to be charged with non-compliance with his or her obligations in the event of a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
The 40-year-old biker from Cobra is still in hospital, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy refers to the opponents' words on the screen
Coach Craig Bellamy, Melbourne Storm, considers the criticism of his team's anti-tank game as a purposeful action of the NRL's two.
According to Trent Robinson, coach Sydney Roosters, the judges gave Storm's bedside to be the harm of the Melbourne hosts to win a rough fight in Sydney on Friday night.
The coach Wayne Bennett covered the reference to Stormi Broncos in the Karsintafinal Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a model match and said that there was no special deal in Queensland.
Bellamy defended her team's cage game and said that they were just focused on their contacts when they used to fight.
Bellamy added that his trust in his own team added that two top teams of coach criticise his team. Bellamy considers this to be an indication that coachers are concerned about losing to Storm.
"This thing is always coming up. I remember Trent Robinson talking nothing about the shirt when his team won us 24-2", Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee you, we haven't changed anything in our defense system or our technology all year round, and for the last six weeks, we've only been putting our hands on the contact game and the bars that have turned us up.
Trent's been on duty for three years, and the waste could have been shocking to him, because he's got a great team that's not used to losing.
It's funny that the same thing comes up at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about what is interesting football, and he reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne's talking about interesting football.
He compared his own team from Saturday to our Friday game and thought their game was interesting," Bellamy said.
"Vuonna 2010 St Georgea received plenty of criticisms from her boring game. Wayne said that she wouldn't even be able to stop her judgment.
Now he's got a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, high-speed midwives.
That's the kind of football you want to play when the player's arsenal is like this.
He stressed this in 2010 and now he wants everyone to play his style, and all the teams don't have a central player like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I get more confidence from this when other trainers are so worried about my team that they will be safe.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that the game between Storm and Roosters made more elections than it was when the Broncos and Cowboys met.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the outcome? 16-12?
The outcome of our game was 20–18. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or is there a game break and a low level of interest in football?
I think goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them."
Storm has a free weekend because the team will be invited to visit either North Queensland Cowboys Cronulla Sharks on Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
A Serbian man for free against $ 200 000 bail in a drug case
A man who can expect life-long convictions from a 40-pound cocaine company smuggled into Queensland has been released against $20,000 guarantees.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by a police officer on a hundred kilos of cocaine cargo from Solay, which had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at Coomera harbour in August.
The police observed the meeting of Maksimovic and his partner on the boat for the morning and then surprised the twin from the Coomera Roadhouse cafe. A 40-pound drug case was found at the parking lot.
Although Maximovicia may expect a life-long period of possession of drugs for commercial purposes, according to a man’s lawyer there is no evidence that his client would have tried to get over the whole lot, but he could have been in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
According to Judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maximovic will try to escape the country.
"Maximovic clearly has connections with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often", said the judge in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about his place of residence."
Together, Maximovic’s mother and stepfather paid 200 000 guarantees against which the man was released.
"At the time when both persons have been given the testimonies, it is clear that $200 000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
"But it's not enough to stop a man from running," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he would give up both Australia’s and Serbia’s passports, report to the police every day and stay at home from night to morning.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to get pedophiles to send pictures.
The pedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone to get pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while she was sleeping and registered in an online message service where she had another user to send herself inappropriate images of children.
Later, after waking up, the girl noticed that the phone was missing, and she noticed that it was sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When explaining the contents of his phone, the girl found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
These five photos were notified to the police, and after they found computers at the address, the police found disturbing Internet searches using hacks to search for inappropriate child images.
Hogg claimed that he was trying to lead pedophiles on the Internet, and that he was playing the police with the aim of scaring pedophiles.
At the local court, D.E.E.I. Robertson said at the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He claimed to be dependent on the fear of the people.
He admitted that he had committed a search on a computer, but claimed that he would act so as to present a police officer and thus intimidate pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about discussions with an unknown person who had sent pictures to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more photos.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead pedophiles.
He told me that he was having disturbing thoughts when he was drinking and that he wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When you found the messages on the phone, the girl screamed at her mother and cried."
She saw inappropriate pictures on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
The girl told me the defendant used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road acknowledged the charges for possession of inappropriate child images last year. Hogg broke his immunity against bail this year on 25 January and failed to arrive at the hearing on 24 March this year.
The defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed in a sexual criminal record, as it may be considered that the offence was not included in any significant sexual characteristics.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the proclamation to October due to the social work background reports.
Hogg was granted an exemption from the guarantees in this case, but he was held in custody on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the sex offender register before the day of the sentence.
Mr Mugabe, Zimbabwe, will make the wrong speech in this House.
The oldest African Head of State, Mugabe, fell on the stairs that led to the speaking age earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of what happened quickly spread in social media.
In addition, Parliament's opening claims that the opposition's legislators have received anonymous death threats, warning them of binge to Mugabe during his speech, were also stunned by the arguments that were put forward by the opposition's legislators.
During the last month, the representatives of the peoples bouted and interrupted the speech of the President in the Parliament on the state situation, and the President held the same speech on Tuesday.
Mr Innocent Gonese, the Bishop of the MDC Party (Movement for Democratic Change) said that seven opposition politicians received text messages calling for them not to interfere with Mr Mugabe's speeches.
"At last, an unknown number has been sent, but the message title is "death", Gonese told journalists after the talk by Mugabe.
The message warns recipients that representatives outside Parliament are no longer in the area of immunity.
The party that led Morgan Tsvangir is concerned about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings measures for business.
The HP is divided into two stock companies later this year and distinguishes computer and printer business from faster growing business-related enterprise hardware and service activities.
According to HP’s information, the company records the non-reflecting costs of USD 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter.
"The restructures allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said HP CEO Meg Whitman, who leads the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more concentrated company in the current HP, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of business that will help companies to move into a new business style." Whitman said.
"As a company, our position is better than ever and we are better able to meet changing needs for our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual turnover is over USD 50 billion and the company focuses on providing unique integrated technology solutions to companies according to its mission.
Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who were raised at the University of Stanford, are now divided into two. The twin was founded in the garage of the electronics company Palo Alto, which is now considered the birthplace of Pilaakso.
The HP has made massive refurbishment when traditional desktop computers are shifting to mobile devices.
The second largest computer manufacturer in the world and HP, one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the latest move in a field where it is believed that concentration will bring success.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Arteta: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before encountering Dinamo Zagreb.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilsher that it is only September. If everything goes well with the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he cannot return to the field already in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to skip at least the following four British country team games.
The most unfortunate of the most recent problem is that Wilshere decided the last period strongly after the more cumbersome and seemed to have returned to his former steel under the new season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
"The story didn't heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It didn't have anything to do with his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically speaking, this may be the case, but as Wengerkin said, additional injuries can come when a player tries to return to the field in the middle of the season.
There is also an unobservable lack of norm.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different kinds of trouble since Wilshere debytoed six years ago.
He also played in Arsenal only 65 of 157 leagues during the last five seasons.
The wider picture of Arsenal is that since 2007-2008, six out of eight seasons have been one of the most affected teams.
Wenger accepts a possible witch band, but Arsenal believes that the improved injury statistics will continue to develop in a better direction during the last period.
"The ability to return after injury can be linked to a vulnerable period, which means that the body must be strengthened and the competition authorities applied for", Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll get through this.
I hope he will balance his body, and I believe in it, and as a result his career will continue as he deserves."
Arsenal starts his master's career on Wednesday nights against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will meet Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on the next Wednesday. Wenger will prepare small changes to the composition.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely beginners.
Wenger can also put Kiera Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott in the opening meeting.
"I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give those who need it," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for the F Group's successor, Maximir Zagreb has the most scary stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been undefeated for 41 games on the team.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was shaken by the earth’s strength to 3,2 Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his lesson since he had to bend to Monaco, and he continues to be motivated by a long-term desire to create a team towards Europe's championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"This title has not yet been hit by Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, I am also realistic with experience.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreaming."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truth about friendship between men
It is remarkable, especially when it comes to considering that the need for men to open up is greater than ever, and the statistics on the suicide of young men are at the highest of 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the most significant cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Britain. Self- murder is three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) is the problem by declaring 2015 men in the year. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In the recent study, 2,000 high school students were interviewed, and according to the study, those with depression symptoms are better off if there are enough healthy people around them.
Also, the likelihood of unsympathetic patients was half when there were people around them who did not have mental health problems.
But all of this is based on friendship.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content. Fast response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalisation of life, the need seems strong, fun and successful doubled even though isolation is a reality.
The external values, money, image and social status of surface success, all of which take attention from internal values and our natural desire for personal growth and friendship. Internal values have a deeper impact on our mental health.
A millionaire in video games recently said that money can't really buy happiness.
That's why Frendi's fineness was that the series turned the focus on his head.
None of the characters in the series were defined by profession but by personality.
The series showed humoristly Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football on their TV chairs. We also saw Ross frequently missing Rachel, and it was clear that men could identify with this even though they were not entirely aware.
One volunteer worker explained this to me: "When I hear people who are depressed and thinking about suicide, it has become clear to me how much the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us often cannot speak to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should do well is strong; a man is easily considered weak if he speaks of his problems."
"Frendit is one of the series of long-term survival mechanisms.
In the series, small moments of friendship between men were emphasized.
I can offer help from outside as a desperate moment, but long-term support is provided from a close proximity to friends and family."
For the honor of Comedy Central FriendsFest, the set of sets has been restored to life. So if you participate in this weekend, you should take your friends to Central Perki.
Or do something even better, smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship relationship can be.
Comedy Central will send the whole Frendit series – all 236 episodes – #FriendsFest for honor
Di Marian's hit helped PSG defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after a goal against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in the painting in her master's too debut and helped PSG hit the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and review.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on strike when Paris Saint-Germain started his work on the Masters' league by hitting Malmön Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made a goal when the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. She confirmed the position of the French champions immediately in hand. However, PSG did pull a number of goals before finally being able to increase their lead: Cavani painted when the game was played for 60 minutes.
There are also Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Section A, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG does not only pursue a follow-up point in the play, but it also wants to improve its positions for a quarter of the remaining three matches.
Although SPG caught the points, the match was not the perfect performance of Laurent Blanc's trusted team. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the goal position and the man had to change when he was his former home company, where the man started his great career in 1999.
"The master league is not easy to win at home or in visitors, so the 2-0 win and the good bets give us a good basis, even though we still have a deceiving period," Blanc said.
"This knows good.
It's a shame we couldn't get together or two more paintings."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after the injury. During the weekend, the team had to be satisfied with 2-2 matches against Bordeaux in the Ligue 1 series, but Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in her shadow at four minutes.
Last month, the Argentinian platform from Manchester United to PSG was appointed a PSG player who will raise the team to a new level in Europe. He proved that he was worthy of the appointment to challenge the ball from Marco Verratt's feed past Malmö's defense and then fired the exact goal behind Johan Wiland.
However, those waiting for PSG’s crush win were disappointed.
The Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched to the field nine international-level players since the start. The team played by five men's defenses and two attackers' tactics was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurjic fired a little past Kevin Trapp's goal in the back of the game in 34 minutes. The team didn't attack very actively.
On the other hand, PSG fell into vain eating and weak finishing, and not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five finishes only in the first half of the time. At the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick put a goal on the wigs of Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his nails in the pitch game, and Ibrahimovic's feed Di Maria shot the rolloff past Wiland in 52 minutes.
The second goal was born at the time of the count of Countess Cavan. A six-gameer shot a full shot when Ibrahimovic gave him a left wingman Maxwell's kick.
Malmö’s letter ended on the second goal, and only Wiland’s peak defense at the close of David Luisz’s shooting was held in discipline, and Ezequiel Lavez’s goal was abandoned at the very end of the forest.
Malmö created Åge Hareide after admitting that PSG was in its own category. "We played the game of the former Masters' league last December.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
The furs aren't enough.
A hat shot for a couple of couples.
"This was a top game for them."
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in share capital.

The White House strengthens Xi Jinping's Washington visit
The White House Communication on Tuesday confirms that Chinese President Xi Jinping travels to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives at his first official visit to Washington on 25 September, and this is a visit from President Barack Obama to Beijing last November.
Following the bilateral discussions between the Heads of State and Michelle Obama, the President of the United States and his spouse Michelle Obama are throwing dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan.

Matt Damon's downplay in filmmaking.
Matt Damon had a lively discussion with the African-American Effie Brown and noted that there was no need for diversity behind the camera.
During the HBO Project Greenlight session presented on Sunday night, Brown was interrupted by an actor who explained how important it was to take into account the different views of the project in the case of the dark-haired headman.
"The story is taken into account in the role of the film, not in the role of the program," Damon claimed.
Brown was stunned and injured by the claim. "Oh, that's all right," she said in Mars after Damon's comment.
Damon and Brown had met with other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
"Whoever is the director, I would like to encourage you to consider how Harmony's character is being presented," Brown said at first.
"The only dark-eyed character is a prostitute who's having sex with her white-haired pimp."
The producer of the Dear White People film supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccoto as directors of the film, and Damon responded harshly that the choice of the twin could lead to the result.
When the debate was on television, the social media blew up Damon's terrible comments.
The Twitter user MrPoon expressed his anger at the scene in direct words: "It is that Matt Damon speaks to the only darker person in order to explain what diversity is, that whiteness is so emphasizing that it hurts."
It was divided over 5,000 times, and it was 4 000 times.
Damon's comments are at a time when a balanced representation of human race in the media is one of the first speeches.
After the death of a teenage Michael Brown from the white police bullet in 2014. Black Lives Pattern received support through the country. The movement aims to stop the discriminatory treatment of legislators and authorities.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the launch of the year's album candidates in Grammy gala.
"Albume still matters," he said.
"It's like books and dark people's lives, albums still matter."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter published an opinion in response to the question of the World News Elisabeth Hasselbeck as to whether this group should be described as an angry group.
"Black Lives Matter is a group of love-based people", the head of the movement said.
Damon is one of the entertainment artists, producers and media musicians invited to the pope to discuss the picture of the Catholic Church in Western lands.
It is not known whether Damon responded with the invitation.

I don't think he's gonna miss it.
He's just happy with his performance.
He has received a great deal of praise from the fans.

After getting to the lead, Hughes gave Ian Kinsler one shot at second in the first shift.
The real cop J.D. Martinez's free magic brought Victor Martinez the first yield of the game.
