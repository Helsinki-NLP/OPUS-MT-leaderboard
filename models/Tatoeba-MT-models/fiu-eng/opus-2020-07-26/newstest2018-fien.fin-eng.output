Camille Auer wanted to fix her sex, was diagnosed as mentally ill, and now she's doing art on the subject, "Man should have the right to his own body."
The roof of the Project room gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts hangs dozens of patient reports.
Every one of them has a name for Cam, Auer.
Papers tell a multi-annual story about how external people have written up their interpretation of Auer and its identity.
He decided who he is.
"I wanted to tell you the person's face-to-face treatment history so that the violence in the process would be visible," Auer says.
At the process, he refers to the sex correction process.
It is often a period of years of study involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts by sending a "sex identity disorder" to diagnostic studies conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.
With Auer, the process started four years ago.
Before this, he had used the estrogen he ordered online and was in his own process of repair.
He experienced himself as a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through the correction process so that the sex can also be corrected legally.
Translaki, i.e. the law on the confirmation of the sex of trans-salile (563/2002) obliges trans-sex people to be forced to sterilize so that the right sex can be obtained, for example, at the Population Register Centre and passports.
At present, every gender-remedurant requires a psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of reproductive failure.
People have the right to decide on their own bodies.
"This situation is unacceptable and violates human rights," says Auer.
There has been a long talk about reforming the Trans Law in Finland.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight observations of law and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to comply with the right of self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared a change of law under the leadership of Mr Susanne Huovinen, Minister for Social Affairs and Health.
The elections came and the Basic Finns went up to the government.
Now, the change of law is stuck again.
It is an internal political dispute that does not even have to do with this law.
"Haltus does not want to put it on the table because there are differences within the government with regard to the change of law", says Frank Johansson, CEO of the Finnish Directorate of Amnesty.
The front part of the exhibition space is controlled by two large installations.
One is made up of the pack and instructions for use of Auer’s medicines.
For example, any visitor in the patient report installation can read the interpretation of the migration psychologist at the University Hospital in Tampere from Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a report on this basis, which should define the treatment of Auer’s justice and access to help.
The perception of the actual reality that is being investigated appears to be depraved.
The study’s perception of itself appears to be limited in a divided way and the unstable features of personality are highlighted.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these illustrations.
"It was shocking to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill," Auer says.
Even more shock was seen when Auer was not treated for gender correction.
According to the treating staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
Then on 11 February 2015 Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transparent waiting room for television.
Later on that television was born a work of art called Monument for the Exclusived, where Auer reflated his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any person identified as a woman in birth can grow their breasts, but you need a diagnosis to remove the breasts," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you try to be other than the number of sex you are born.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only quality.
The gender correction process is more severe for many mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Its passage meets dozens of people who need to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy for people who are in need of support and help to refuse treatment, claiming that their resources are not enough," Auer says.
Many people who have applied for the process have underlying mental symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible temptation experiences.
In this case, medical care can be prescribed that treatment cannot be started.
"Inhibition of care and assistance can feed man even worse than it was before the process started," Auer says.
The individual exhibition of Auer also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that's what people usually find it hard to melt".
The depression has been treated with drugs, and when Auer started using hormones, it became easier.
He had finally been able to express the feelings that existed in childhood and teen life.
Why the wide jaw did not seem appropriate to its own body and why the breast muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer is that there are people near him who see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"It is time to justify so much by talking, dressing, sound and movement," he says.
Today Auer is already seeing him, he exists as a woman.
However, at the beginning of the process, random comments close to the process could have hurt a lot.
It hurts most when close misunderstandings.
"They should know who I am, and they know who I am, but they won't, they won't, they won't, they'll be able to internalize it," he'll continue.
However, not all transhumans require physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or physical distress, where body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and the long research process, official confirmation of their own sex cannot be obtained.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," Auer says.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right of self-determination in relation to legal sex.
A full-time applicant submits a written application for a new identity, explaining that he or she is experiencing a second sex.
After six months of consideration, the applicant shall confirm his application in writing and the Ministry shall give the applicant a new identity card.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland and this requirement is also subject to Auer's exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for an artist; it is a political and artistic collection.
I want to believe that art is still a priority and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The civil society organisation has provided travel equipment to Missouri.
The National NAACP organisation for African-American civil rights has provided travel equipment for Missouri, which is responsible for discriminatory practices and racist attacks in the state.
"The travel information on NACP Missouri will enter into force on 28 August 2017 and calls on African-American tourists, visitors and local people to pay particular attention and take extreme care when travelling to a state where there have recently been numerous cases of questionable race-based events", the Organization’s report states.
The law recently entered into force in Missouri makes it difficult for the export of cases of discrimination, and the implementation of State law is disproportionately directed at minorities, according to the NEACP, which led to the provision of travel equipment.
People's civil rights are being violated.
They are stopped on the basis of the skin color and are abused or killed," said Rod Chapel, Chairman of the NAACP Missouri, who told Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of one of several cases in one short time."
The travel information on Missouri is the first warning to the United States of America.
The organization mentioned, for example, the racist comments against African students at Missouri University and the death of a 28 - year - old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in question under earlier conditions this year, and he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and Missouri's police arrested him even though he wasn't charged with crime.
The travel notice also referred to the Missouri Minister of Justice's report that the police are more likely to stop the black driver than the white one by 75%.
"The purpose of the travel information is to urge people to be alerted and alert their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
For example, people must prepare themselves by taking money to pay guarantees or by telling relatives that they intend to travel through the state.
According to the FBI, in 2015 one hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri, the sixth largest in the United States.
The travel equipment is also the answer to the new law of Missouri, which makes it difficult for companies to challenge the right to reside and discrimination in employment.
The ACLU, which has been guaranteed by the Constitution, has recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona since they had adopted immigration laws that oblige the police to arrest people for immigration violations.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and they concern other countries, but recently NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the supplementary pension of the Executive Director
The Minister of Economic Affairs of the State, Mika Lintilä (Central) has asked Finnair for a report on the supplementary pension fee received by Mr Pekka Varamo, director of the airline, says Yle.
According to the Minister, it is contrary to the will of the State.
The additional pension of EUR 130 000 received by Varaamo rose this week when Helsinki's Words news about the development of the remuneration of the leaders of the stock companies.
The Suomen Kuvalehti news about Varaamo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair stated that she would give up the supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has drawn the line that no further pensions will be used to reward.
The government owns over half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the decision on ownership management last year.
The sanctions were hard to talk right away.
A while ago, it seemed that the relations between the United States and Russia were moving from cold to warm.
During the G20 meeting of the industrialised countries in Hamburg, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin looked great on each other.
Since then, the atmosphere has become much colder.
The new economic sanctions that were adopted last week by the US Congress and signed by Trump last Wednesday were well responded in Russia.
The most serious answer has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, which states that the mandatory tent signed by Trump means "a full-scale trade war".
Even if the Russian reactions were to be paid only as cuts and supersedes of political retortism, the tightening between the United States and Russia is a fact after the short post-Trumb season.
In the United States, it was not easy to pass through the sanctions law on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
However, the Congress adopted the law with considerable agreement, but the adoption of the law to the President was far more difficult than it was said.
Trump criticises the law he has signed as "the law that he has signed".
President Trump may have been the reason, especially for Russia, even though the adoption of a law restricting its own powers must have been counterproductive.
As is well known, in the United States, investigations are being carried out both on Russia's possible interference with the presidential elections and on the Trump campaign's Russian connections.
The tightening between the United States and Russia is a fact after the short autumn of the year.
Once the White House's staff has changed into a hole and a variety of scandalous turns have been revealed to almost upgrade, it seems more and more clearly that foreign policy does not lead the president in the United States, despite the President.
Such a situation is not desirable in any way.
If Russia is a kimurant in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tension in the security situation in the European Union's nuclear area is tightening up relations in the Baltic Sea.
The EU has made clear the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Treaty.
Although the Union has so far remained at least on the part of Russia's policies, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State that trades much with Finland, economic sanctions have been a real problem.
The effects of the recent US Penal Code are still unclear.
In the EU, it has been feared that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, for example, the effects may be felt in Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline projects and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant.
acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of sanctions, for example, from the US economy, an important liquid natural gas ng.
Trade sanctions are a means of world politics to show blasphemy.
However, economic sanctions must be highly considered and precise.
Otherwise, they will be easily more damaging than useful.
Isn't anything sacred anymore?
Trump's White House now has its most important Freedom statue.
The lack of pizza is a sure sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as the rest of us: the Iraqis, together with the American soldiers, took the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos' square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologists of Trump's administration, knew well what was going on with CNN-channel Jim Acosta, who was under attack by Miller, who made the President's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't exactly criticise the statue himself.
If he had done that, he would have been attacked by a huge flock of cruise organisers and by a wonderful figure of liberty.
His attack was targeted at the significance of the statue, and in particular the addition of Emma Lazarus poem — 17 years after the statue was completed.
Thus Miller set up Acosta: "I don't want to go into it in more detail in history now, but the statue of freedom is a symbol of the freedom of the whole world of the Americans.
The poem was later added, and it is not part of the original Freedom Palace."
Miller wasn't wrong himself, but it's not just about history, as he himself said.
The words that touch Lazarus are essential, the only ones in which the state does not call only immigrants but "the poorest of all the poor": "Your tered, your poror, / Your huddled mass yearning to breake free,"
The poem is more timely now than ever.
Miller did not practice the criticism of literature, but he made it clear that "the most poor one" is not welcome to Trump's United States.
The dispute about the importance of the freedom statue is part of the broader political and cultural debate on the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus’ friends campaigned for the poem to be attached to the statue's feet.
The purpose of the statue was to express the links between the French and the American Republic with a classic symbol of freedom by the female body of the human body.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem the female character is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it's giving itself a new name, a deported mother.
The addition of the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American nationhood.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back to its original.
Rush Limbaugh – a designer who can now be considered as some kind of prophecy about Trump – claimed in 2010 that the statue of liberty is not invited to anyone, but is the early lead of the New Conservatives, who takes the thunder of the United States to cover the world: "Lady Liberty comes out.
He takes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The call doesn't show us the way to the United States."
Rarely yes, Limbaugh was partially right.
The importance of the statue of freedom depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and exhausted but desirable immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and experimental journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people looking for protection and a better life.
His Freedom statue comforts us by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's what Miller and Trump never want.
Their ringing doesn't look like the way, but is burning the flames of anger, their only source of power.
World Championships in sport 2017: Neil Black praises members of the UK Country Team in Scotland
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots got to the UK country team.
President Neil Black of the UK General Sports Union says that 16 Scottish members of the World Championship team are "markable confirmation".
A record of the number of Scottish athletes has been selected for the World Cup in London on Friday.
According to Black, something special is happening in Scotland, which the UK's general sport must learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it for as long as we understand what it is," Black says.
"I spoke with representatives of the Scotland Sports Institute, and they thought it was related to the Institute's activities.
The Scotland General Sports Union believes that it relates to the Union's activities,
and the UK General Sports Union believes that they are in a position to do so.
And the usual streetkeeper thinks he's got something to do with it.
But it's something absolutely awesome, which is what it's all about."
Many Scottish athletes in London really compete for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a five thousand metres run. Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the country team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"The athletes left the opportunity proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they were living and practicing.
Eidith's words had genuine emotion and passion for sports."
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist of the National Championships in the 400-metre fence race, and these are his fifth World Championships, and he thinks it's "infidel" that there are 16 credits in the country team.
The previous record was from seven years 1983 and 2015.
The mid-passer Laura Muir has been running five UK and two European records during the year.
He competes in London at 1 500 meters and 5 000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs in London 1 500 meters, and he should also be watched: he has an excellent season behind him, which includes winnings in the UK's World Cups and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Championship, when his only shot was Lee McConnell.
The Earth Team captain says he's "very proud" of the fact that there are so many Scots involved, some of which are actually competing for final positions and medals.
"At the end of the day, access to Cappen is a great honour, but even more specific, because the members of the team voted for the captain," Doyle says.
"I am, of course, very proud of all the Scots that got into the country team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are part of the awarded athletes who compete for the awardees.
My captain's speech?
I thought it went well.
I was focused on how lucky we were when we had a home party.
It is important to enjoy home public support and being at the Olympic Stadium again.
I get another chance to compete there, and I know that the atmosphere will be amazing."
Obstruction of critics on Facebook: Do not stand up for public office if you do not tolerate criticism
Our country's father knew what was bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticise him for any domestic policy that he could always have on his political principles.
I'm sure the criticism was agitated,
But he didn't slow down his critics.
"If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led as dumb and quiet as sheep for slaughter," Washington said in 1783.
That's how we get to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and prevented their performers.
The U.S. civil rights union appealed to Hogan's court earlier this week.
His staff consider the challenge unwarranted, and his attitude was also limited online.
"What difference does it make? This is only Facebook," many comments.
But the point is,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the amazing popular Republican governor of the state ruled by the Democrats.
He has received the second best reviews among the 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to the hot fish.
He has led the state firmly and strictly adhered to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main contact channel for his voters and published a picture of his baldness in chemotherapy.
That is why preventing users from coming to the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor's page is a public and official forum that his staff maintains in the tax reserve.
Hogan's publisher Amelia Chase defended the governor's actions in his interview with Washington Post, and he said that it was just about the moderation of comments.
However, the characterisation of commentors as trolls, smugglers, or haters is too easy a solution.
Washington Post interviewed Hogan's Facebook users.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to discuss with the leaders of their choice, not trolls but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors.
They told us that their comments were respectful, kind, and proper.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to the Catholic faith of Hogan.
The lawyer, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland's Bowie, was not hostile, but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I am politely disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand for hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in his comments on Washington Post's news.
Nor can I accept the fact that when more people comment on the same thing, they are immediately considered to be an organized group, and as a large group they are concerned about."
The governor's staff called the comments "Centrally Attack".
During the Facebook era, communication is easy to manage by preventing a critic or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers that published critical headlines, or to arrest and slow down the protesters.
But actually, it's the same thing, and now it's only digital.
Hogan is not the first public official indictment accused of clogging Facebook and other social media channels.
The Twitter users that President Trump's blocked have been suing him.
The first major decision on this issue was taken last week in Virginia.
According to Judge James C. Cacheris, the Government of Loudoun County violated the first addition of the U.S. Constitution by preventing the voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Association went to talk to Kentucky's Republican Governor Matt Bevin about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
At Washington’s time, preferential postal charges had a similar effect to those on the Internet today.
The number of newspapers was quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and the anonymous writers were mutilating Washington.
That's when there were trolls.
The names Jaricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters calling Washington’s decisions.
There were petitions to the President's office to criticise Jay's agreement on cooperation, trade and maritime affairs between the United States and the United Kingdom, and this is reflected in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington.
But he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are fundamental stones for our people.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
Summer food for birds should be stopped immediately.
Samples have become about half a dozen locations, and also online reports of couples, three.
Most of them have become from South and Varsinais-Suoma, but then also individuals from Haapaveda and Seinäjoki, a special investigator from Marja Isomursu Evira.
The Greens have died of paranoia called trichomonosis.
It is caused by a scientific called Trichomonas gallinae in the early animal.
It has previously been known to hit on the kypsies, and especially to the bulge.
In the 21st century, however, the disease was also observed in the papiples.
The year 2009 was a very good one.
Then the trimonose caused a great collapse in the greenland of Finland, after which the strains of the species have been recovered.
There have been sick greensmiths now, but not yet on a large scale, at the University of Helsinki's Institute of Natural Sciences (Luomus) Museum Manager Juha Honkala says.
It is feared that the previous epidemic of green-peelings will come again, unless something is done.
What must now be done is very simple thing that can be done by everyone: to stop the bird’s summer meal immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from homefield progress at the Reneesance Club.
The former European First Player Ronan Rafferty hopes that he will benefit from his home-field development for the next three days, when the Renassance Club in Eastern Latin is held at 25th Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irish Rafferty last year led a tournament in the neighbor's Archerfield Links field before the last round, but eventually disappeared for Paul Eales. Rafferty prefers a new place and acts as a tournament ambassador for the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and as a result of this event, it gets to its full glory," Rafferty says.
"The shelters will see the field at their best. It's in great condition.
Jerry's been doing a great job with this place.
He's a game-rich ambassador, and he's proud of his timings here.
The tournament is a great performance event for this field."
The English Eves defends the championship for the first time, even though it has won its 32-year career, both the tour of Europe and the challenge tour of Europe.
"This really feels like a special opportunity," says the player in Southport.
"I was unable to defend my Extremadura Open victory because the tournament was not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to mind: the tournament victory was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time for us to always remember."
Gary Orr will return to his own ground, after he went on tour earlier this year for 50 years.
This is his first performance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"At home is always more relevant than usual," says Orr, in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again, and I've played pretty hard.
"I'm happy with my troll so far."
The triangle will be followed by Ian Woosnam, the former Masters winner, and the major winners of the seniors, Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament is attended by six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance as well as Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

In the sähähä, there were possible problems with the inner air of the carar.
In the spark of the Pori Brigade’s message company’s cashmere building has not been found until now, there have been no problems with indoor air, and it was reported on Thursday.
Further internal aviation studies will continue.
The investigations began when a man who interrupted his military service for health reasons believed that he was in a state of ill health because of the bad inner air of the carcase.
According to Colonel Mika Holma, the Prime Minister of the Pori Brigade, there have been no problems in the health situation of other guards.
It turned out that this was a single case, and other servants in that unit had no health problems.
Each notification is taken seriously and we wanted to examine this issue thoroughly.
At present, it is not known that we have any internal air problem, says Holma.
The Prikatti press says that as a result of the arrival of July, there has been a need to transfer goods to the Chambers, which may have led to an instant increase in dust.
Because of this, the air may have seemed intruded, Holma says.
Poverty and death in the goldland of Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use the tenderness of her cooking.
Even a soldier doesn't use him very rarely.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital city of Pania, located in the Indonesian resting province of Papua. When she makes dinner, she usually puts Batatatin – locally "nota" – straight to the fire.
In half an hour, the burnt Batate on the carree will be eaten with covetously naked, unwashed hands.
There's no furniture in Dege's home, and he's sitting in a muddled area, where he usually treats his daily Askees, such as laundry from the nearby swamp in the water.
Visiting office delivers a bucket in the missing room.
Degei is the youngest of four wives and has not been assigned to handle the fields.
A lot of marriages are common around here.
Later work can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink plenty.
"No one dares to walk in the village after five nights," Degei says.
This is a rare citation on the highlands of Pappua, in the former Dutch colonial country, which was attached to Indonesia in 1969.
The local independence movement that opposed Dutch power quickly turned its anger to the Jakarta Government, which is holding the region tightly under control, and prevents foreign suppliers and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed to Papua and Western Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
The Enarotali is a remote one and a bump. The trip there starts on a one-and-a-half hour flight from the province's capital to Jayapur to Nabire and continues on a five-hour drive from the stomach to the rental car.
There's no public traffic here.
Approximately 19 000 inhabitants in the city have wooden houses surrounded by the Bambuds, whose aalpothets of rust have been dyed into bellows.
Only a few Indonesians have visited here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago tribes worshiped the god of Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have clothes like this," Degei says. He means colourful, hand-cuffed, dark bit and bright-colored puzzle.
"before we had only leaves covered in our bodies."
Papa is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28 per cent of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy being the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian goldland.
Pania is the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, located in the Freeport McMoran company, which is located in Phoenix in the United States, only about a hundred miles [100 km] from Pania.
In 2015, the mine brought Freeport $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion of wood reserves.
These riches, however, bring misery to the clergy, for they mean the repressive presence of a strong army in Indonesia.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military staff and local military units almost $20 million in 1998-2004.
The requirements of the beans for greater self - control threaten this source of income, and they are silenced with mercy.
According to human rights activists, after 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 clergymen and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass deaths at the highlands of the Papia tribes in the 1970s were in proportion to genocide.
Last year the Indonesian police arrested more than 3 900 people in peaceful demonstrations in the area.
In the report of the British Archdiocese We Will Lose Everything of 2016, there are reports of cruelty in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture, rapes and electric shocks are particularly popular – and unscrupulous attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of people, because there are cases weekly," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher from Human Rights Watch.
Ruuvia has been blackmailed when Pappua’s natural resources attract migrants from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of Provinces, 83 percent are Christian, but the population structure is changing as the people of Indonesia are moving from the islands of Jaava, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes to change the area in the hope of a better survival.
The Japanese waung-food cans sell roasted chicken and gado-gado-grado blend in peanut sauce.
It's hard for the locals to compete.
"The changers have started selling chicken and vegetables at the market worse than the locals," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old, from Pania, and moved to the province's capital after work.
Local women lost their clients.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widododo, said Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to address the injustice and human rights violations in Papua.
Papa is composed of 29 regions, and this former wooden stick won the vote in 27 regions, including in Pania, on its way to Jakarta Presidential Castle.
But only a little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our heart was broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and we expected him to meet our wish and restore justice," says You.
Pania had some kind of wave base only for two months after Jokowin's days of office.
eleven children were singing Christmas songs at the fire at Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on motorcycles.
The scared children told the soldiers that they should use driving lights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers caught the children and assaulted them with a rifle.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, became the result of a coma abuse.
A few hours later, the building of the National Election Commission, which was located near the venue, was set on fire, and the next day it began to take place.
About a thousand men and women of the paparazzi — young men and women and children — gathered to the football field before the local police station and the military headquarters to demand justice.
They were accompanied by hunts for holidays, and they began to perform a traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, where they dance around and track the bird song.
Some of the protestors began to stone the buildings of the police and the army.
When the atmosphere was heated, the soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: "If the crowds do more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document that has not been published by the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, Head of the Kego Koto area, deserted the situation from its extremities and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot at the left side," he told the TIMME magazine with his brightly painted wooden house fibers.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the lines of soldiers.
A series of shots were fired in the bulge.
Alfius Youwia was shot three times, his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure that it was really him," told Yohanes TIMME that he was sad, and as many Indonesians, he used only one name.
"I saw that he was dead, I kissed him."
Pappuan police inspector Yotje Mende told the reporters that only the police were protecting the police station because it was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Pudjo Suistiyo, journalist of the Papua Police Department in 2015.
"That's when it comes to life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many were injured.
The next day, information about death was carried by Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, where he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that the violence would be addressed by Papa.
"I want the case investigated immediately so that nothing like this ever happens again."
In October 2016, Minister for Security Wiranto said that he would launch investigations on human rights violations outside the legal system.
But he started to cancel his speech right away.
"The part of the damage took place a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate infringements, but that requires certain processes," he said.
At the TIMME magazine interview in Jakarta on 5.6.2017 Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he was not going to start the studies with Papa.
"All will be settled in court," he told me.
In 1999 the UN accused Wiranto of "criminal crimes against humanity". The crimes are related to more than a thousand deaths in the bloodless independence vote in East Timor, and Wiranto told the TIME magazine that 11 cases have already been resolved about the human rights violations in Papua, including the events in Pania.
The families of Pania’s victims have a synonymous attitude to claims.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired of this."
He tells us he's still living in fear, even though it's been years.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I fear the army will arrest me, and I fear I will be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panites are afraid to discuss the event.
He says that the soldiers had abused him when he had helped bury four victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after the victims are buried," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in the neighboring area of Pania in Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured by a conflict between the village residents and the head of the building company, which started when the manager refused to take his mind of the man who lost his mind to the hospital.
The man who needed medical treatment was 24 years old Ravianus Douw, who had been in the water while fishing in a nearby river, and he died on his way to the hospital.
The hated villagers showed their opinion on the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned policemen who responded with warning shots.
However, according to the local authorities, a police force in Indonesia, which moved, opened fire toward a crowd, was killed by a villageman.
"We're terrified, we're afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badi, who lives near the hospital and saw wounded being brought to the hospital.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for shots to be fired from the area by the police and the mobile police force.
Pania has always been the problem of the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development will feed dissatisfaction in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes who live in the wheatlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Gentiles through random attacks and kidnappings of the Indonesian army.
Some of OPM leaders are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded by arresting and illegally arresting thousands of people in Panama in the name of "national sovereignty".
Some of the arrests will never come back.
Pania is known as "serious, forgotten place" among the priests.
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There is little rice for sale in the Enarotal, and it is also too expensive for the locals,
Like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly Batats and some fruit and leaves.
Farming is women's work, and one woman's responsibility can have four or five bats.
Most of the rain is for the family, and the rest are sold on the market.
Only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
As a result of time, differences in local and migratory incomes have increased and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes at Nabire Airport.
There are little jobs, and they usually go to local better-educated and wealthy migrants.
Only a few beans have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, president of the tribe council in Pania.
I'm going to get a little attention from the world.
Furthermore, the restrictions on international news are still tight.
Earlier this year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papa even though they had been granted a rare description permit. The official reason was inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kinen, the Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his electoral promises; he has not increased transparency and has not promoted progress by removing the restrictions on news.
"A new risk exists for journalists from the eastern provinces of Indonesia and from Western Papua: visa refusal and black list entry," Kine said in her opinion.
The lack of freedom of action in the press means that only the neighbours of Pappua are under pressure by the Indonesian Government.
In March, six States of the Pacific – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – invited the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the numerous and widespread violations of Papuan, including the Pania shooting.
These countries have traditionally supported the Papua liberalisation movement.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a journalist from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, denied charges and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so covering evidence of human rights violations would be difficult".
The locals want the governments of the foreign authorities to be lacking in the matter.
When the official Dutch delegation, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura 4.5.2017, locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says the anonymous source of the meeting.
In Indonesia there are presidential elections in 2019, but the clergy say that it is likely that Mr Jokowi will no longer vote.
"Yekowi means good, but there are people around him who are confused with Pania's shooting," says Gobai.
He wants Jokowin to know the situation of the Panais: they live under the influence of a greedy and unpredictable army in the absence of poverty, virtually without health services and training opportunities.
According to Goba, the Panayans, like the rest of the clergy, hold the voices that he gave to Jokow as “loose,” which must be paid back.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
In spite of threats and intimidation, the victims of the Pania shooting have once again shown a symbolic resistance: they buried one of the victims of the police station and an army post in the opposite country.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," says Yacobus in his head.
"What else could we do?"
Derek Chisora barks about canceling Robert Helenius's replay: "In fact, his own fans don't want to see"
Robert Helenius and Derek Chisoran were supposed to be in Hartwall arena on 27 May.
However, the game was cancelled for commercial reasons.
Chisora's recent interview with the IFL TV makes the reason for re-floping the re-floping match completely on Helen's shoulders.
My fight in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's miserable, Chisora's bored.
For the first time, Helenius and Chisora met in the full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial dot.
The ticket sales of the replay went silent, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match was moved to autumn.
There's nothing new about the game.
However, the withdrawal is no longer a harm to Chisora.
In fact, the fight would probably have to be withdrawn after Chisora's illness in any case.
Thursday, three days before the time of the match, I woke up in pain.
My puller was about to explode.
At the hospital, they said I had to be cut, Chisora tells me.
Britt says he's in about 45 percent condition right now.
He's not interested in a re-election with Helenius, but he's got Dillian Whyte on the target.
Chisora suffered a loss in December.
You've come to your power to repeat the Torch cloud-cracker in Dubai.
The flames took over the world’s highest residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee from the 79th high building.
This was already another fire within two years in a building whose name happens to be a Torch, hurdle.
The building was cleared up, and no one knew was injured, and for the sake of the fire there was no idea immediately after the event.
"We were asleep and woke up with the sound of the fire alarm and people's screams.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes," George's resident told Reuters.
According to the Dubai rescue authorities, fire-fighting forces were put out at 4 p.m. in the morning for local time and remained cooling the building.
The government announced that he would arrange accommodation for those who left his home.
The case may again raise questions about the security of materials used on high buildings’ outer surfaces around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Torch Building Board carried out a study that found that the most damage suffered by the roofing and isolation records.
In Britain, the police believe that London’s Grenbell Tower isolation and curtains could contribute to the rapid progress of flames in a fire where 80 people died in June.

In the United States, more than 20% of air travel passengers take prohibited objects, reveal a survey
The survey of passengers reveals that more than 20 % of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unwittingly carried prohibited items past the inspection points of the U.S. Transport Safety Agency (TSA). At least 6 % of passengers had knives or other articles with steel which they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent reported that they had only subsequently learned that they had carried weapons, ammunition, or explosives in the crash.
More than a thousand passengers responded to the questionnaire, and it was carried out by Stratos Jet Charterers. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to undermine the rules.
In the TSA, 19.7% of passengers who had deliberately broken the rules were representatives of the Y group and less than 15% were members of the X group.
The most common rules were breached by taking food and liquids to the plane.
In addition, 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men reported that they had taken banned drugs knowingly onto the plane.
The survey involved passengers from all over the United States. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many of them had accidentally carried out security checks and how many had done so knowingly.
It is not surprising that most passengers are also most likely to pass through security checks – knowingly or knowingly.
But as the surveyed company notes, TSA's instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often don't know what fluids you can take on a plane and how much.
It is not a surprise, then, that most of the TSA's back-up are liquids.
For some time there was also a feeling that no book should be taken on the plane.
You can take the liquids to domestic flights, but not international flights.
Scott Pruitt, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, passed his decision to delay the decisions taken during Obama's period to reduce emissions
The day following the challenge of 15 states to the law of Scott Pruit, Head of EPA, Praitt, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the United States, has withdrawn its previous decision to delay the implementation of smoke-reducing decisions taken during the Obama administration period.
According to the Praitt, the change shows that the agency he led takes better account of the needs of environmental decision-makers in the States.
Mr Pruitt did not mention the action brought against his earlier decision at the federal court of appeal.
As of 1.10.2015, States Parties should start to comply with the requirements for earth ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would move the implementation of decisions forward by year so that his agency would have more time to get to know the plan, because the Agency "don't want to intervene in local decision-making or harm economic growth".
Pruitt was the public prosecutor of Oklahoma State before President Donald Trump appointed him Head of EPA, known as the opposition to more stringent environmental regulations.
After entering Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical and fossil fuels industries.
The sudden change in mentality in the mid-week is the latest setback to the Prutit plan to mitigate the provisions.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington adopted the decision that the Head of EPA exceeded his mandate in trying to delay the implementation of the Obama decision on oil and gas companies, which obliged companies to monitor and reduce methane flows.
In the opinion of Wednesday evening, Pruitt claimed that his full translation of ozone rules only strengthens the EPA's cooperation with the States in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements in line with the timetable.
"In previous administrations, EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines, and then expected the activist groups and others to challenge the court to reach an agreement on timetables", Pruitt said. In her previous action, she appealed to the environmental agency more than ten times.
"We do not believe in the regulation that takes place through the trial and take time seriously.
We also take a serious interest in the regulation on our activities and in its mandate to us."
However, in the EPA opinion, it was noted that Pruitt could continue to be able to use 'prove the implementation of decisions and other legal powers' in order to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information".
In Congress, the Republicans are making wider changes to the ozone regulations.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The Association of State Parties, which has been sued this week by EPA, led by the General Prosecutor of New York, Eric Schneiderman, said that the group intends to continue the pressure.
"EPA's change of mind as a result of our complaints is a major victory for 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to direct effects of the smoke smoke in their communities", Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
The ozone of the ground is produced by, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil processing plants and chemical plants reacting to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The smoke smoke resulting from this can cause serious breathing difficulties for vulnerable groups, and this is also due to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health promoters and environmental protectors were delighted by the surprising change in Prutit’s direction.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required to make a healthy sense of our breath-related guy," says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We still have to fight against Trump's administration, because it is the ideal aim of being on the terms of the polluters and other groups of their own interests."
The supercar manufacturer is coming to the street, "to meet the Ferrari style"
It also plans to bet on hybrid sports cars while trying to hold onto its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will take place in the Ferrar style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said the plans at the information meeting on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, Automotive News news.
All outbreaks of East Savo with the same virus type
There is the same virus type as in previous cases in East Savo, reports THL.
On Thursday, the Virology of the Institute for Health and Welfare has ensured that the fifth ash infection in East Savo is the same virus strain with previous infections.
THL has made sure that on Friday, 28 July, a person on the beach is infected with the same virus type as the previous case of East Savo.
On the basis of this information, all infections in East Savo relate to the first ashtray found in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means we haven't seen any other types of ash virus.
However, it is possible that new infections can be seen from the fifth affected until the end of August, and therefore the epidemic is not over, says Mikhaleena Erkkilä, a doctor responsible for primary health diseases in Soster.
No new ashtrays or doubts have been identified since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the timeliness of his own vaccination, Erkkilä reminds us.
More on: In Pirkanmaa, three new ashtray infections were confirmed - "Legal infections or epidemics are very unlikely"
Finland prepares for a promising ban
It wasn't even considered legalized.
In the background, the process produces methanol, which is toxic.
The manufacture of the shield at home is legal next year, but the regularisation of the pointwork is not even considered.
The race will be prepared by use, the point will be distilled again.
The background of the Tislaus regulation is that the process, along with the wine, produces methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to regulate the performance of points for every man's right, and Ismo, Minister of Government, commenting on the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the alcohol law, it was not considered to be legalised.
It was not brought to a political table either.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, says Commissioner Outi Mäkelä (kok.).
He is in the negotiating group of parliamentary groups in the Government Party, who took a position on the reform of the alcohol law.
The permit to distill a spot at home cannot continue to be granted even from the application.
Commercial manufacturing is also maintained as a permit.
The introduction tells us that there will be a simple rule for the domestic manufacture of alcoholic beverages: alcohol may be produced at home by visits.
This means that, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can make a legal scream at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the rules.
The new law removes the requirements of taste and flavourings and allows for the preparation of the ban, Mäkelä specify.
The preparation must still be so that the raw materials or flavourings produced in connection with their use are clearly detectable.
Under the new law, drinks can be made as much as they want, and self - discipline alcohol can be given as a gift.
You can't still put it on sale.
Making a ban is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Import believes.
A much higher change occurred in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The alcohol law comes to Parliament as soon as the time starts.
The session was held on 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament had already taken a stand, Mäkelä is delighted.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to the hospital by armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pain, was rushed to the South African hospital for heart attacks.
Pistorius's already got out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is suffering from his prison sentence in Atteridgeville prison.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison reporter confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for research.
The informant of the Pistorius family told me that the former top athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court condemned a six-fold gold medalist of Paralympics in prison for six years the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Littered telephone conversations reveal Trump's pressure on Mexico to build a border wall
The literines of phone discussions between the U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have leaked to Washington Post.
On 27 January 2017, Trump asked the Mexican President, Enrique Peña Nieto, to stop his public talk that he was not going to pay the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States called Nieto for this to be publicly stunned by the wall project. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also published the recording of Trump's first call to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on their way to Australia is 'serious', 'serious' and 'serious'. According to Trump, during the Obama period, the negotiated agreement would make him look like an idiot' because he had proposed a ban on the residence of refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the call by saying to Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call all day."
Georgia's massacre: Activists repatriated in the hope of the right to a racist lead
The Ford Mercury car crosses the population in Monroe's small town in Georgia's rural area and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, four armed men blocking the road before the car gets on the bridge.
The leader of a team, a middle-aged man dressed in a strip suit, takes a deep breath through his cigarard and pulls through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" a man's agitated.
Get out of the car!
The rumors break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
This shocking event, fortunately, is just a repression that was presented on 22 July 2017.
However, the shocks of shock are real when the hanger eye is thrown into the neck of the "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to Moore's Ford's bridge to repatriate the events in 1946. At that time Ku Klux Klan made two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's been charged with murder.
"It is confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – although murderers live among us and many must know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who will help with the restructuring arrangements.
"It's a disgrace to history, but above all it's a burden that weighs our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian congressman.
To him, repression is an alarming invitation to action, and it also reminds Monroe’s residents that the wrong has never been corrected.
"We want those who are guilty to go to court, and we want things to be finally finished, and we want to recover from grief and make a reconciliation, but above all we want justice," says Brooks.
"We can't recover and make peace until we get justice."
The coroner will cover the body of the victim who died in Georgia's massacre on 27 July46.
According to the FBI documents received by NBC news, more than 50 men from Monroe and its surrounding districts were suspected of being deadlocked.
But no one was accused of murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say that the motives of lead have always been local: politics and sex.
In 1946, black people in the state of Georgia had the highest right to vote for the first time in the presidential elections, the Supreme Court adopted its decision in April, and the elections were held in summer.
According to the FBI, during the election, there was an incident in which a black tenant Roger Malcom stabbed the white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently touched Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
Brooks said that the city was told that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting this child.
According to the FBI, an effective white landowner, Loy Harrison, paid the $600 guarantee of Malcom against which he was released from prison on 25 July46.
On their way home with Malcom and Dorothy were their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their cars before the Moore's Ford bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and arranged murders," the FBI report says.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities, and the authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks puts it more closely.
"It was a vote kill," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to the black people that they would do the same if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been conducting the re-shipment of Georgia's massacre for almost a decade.
The presentation is extremely realistic and incarcerated, and it is a description of a shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States today.
It's hard to watch the show, but it's even harder not to look at what Greene says it's meant to be.
"We don't want to talk about lead, because we have to face up to our own dark side," says the director.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you can't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
This year’s presentation began in June. On the first day about 30 actors — tens of blacks and twenty whites — gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the presentation.
Wade Marbaugh acts as Greene's assistant director.
He has presented a local leader of Ku Klux Klan in the transhipment process for years, but the role is always just as difficult and unbiased.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"It is important, however, that this aspect of history also be kept out so that it never again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona train Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show starts at a scene where Malcom yells and plucks Hester, and he's upset that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
"You didn't hear me?
Rascona or Hester will answer.
Then we'll hit him.
And then all (at least all black actors) go to laugh.
Greene laughs harder.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene's snorting.
"I just don't think that's when the whites used the word n--u."
"Yes," the other black actor confirms.
"It's a slang, you need to use a longer version."
The subject of the presentation is unpleasant, but the power of the room to a friend's life.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, and they want to respect the memory of those who have died.
The scene begins at the beginning.
And now the words of Rascona are under control.
Nobody laughs.
Reimbursement ends quickly and violently.
Drugs, shots – and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral is standing next to the bodies and singing a Billie Holiday Strange Fruit.
His voice is broken for every second word.
A few ten metres away, five hundred viewers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost half of the audience is black and half white.
There's a couple in the team who's come to see the show in Ithaca from the state of New York, but most of it's local.
They've been using Brooks' guidance to help the victims in the graves of Georgia's pressure on moisture.
The murders have changed from the story to the truth, the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song show, Greene invites the crowd to check the bodies.
Children struggle to watch artificial blood and mobile bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mulchs like to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene would like to thank the public.
Actors who present them took off their sign and wiped out tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaughi, the man who presented the local Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then breaks into tears after the hard show.
"Don't worry," the woman in the show makes me feel better.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and actors will meet for a joint dinner.
A white couple from Altanta will be very busy discussing the performance with the black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski is difficult to find words when he describes the feelings of the performance.
"It's hard to listen to terrible words and watch terrible deeds that say and do people who look the same as you – precisely because they look the same as you," he says.
"I was made aware that there were still shorts," he added. "They just called arrests."
On the other side of the room Brooks recalls the development of civil rights on the same table for the audiences.
He tells me he's already started planning next year's show.
"Resurrection is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also a educational experience", Brooks says.
"The message is that this can happen again if we do not take it to learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it."
Stimulating plants in shops is breaking up: To this extent, removing "overall parts" really saves
Is it allowed to remove the florist leaves already in the store before weighing?
And what about taking out the big hat of the duck? That weighs how much?
The answers are strongly divided: for one, it is an indication of the nucleus being passed, while others do not want to pay for the parts of the vegetables that are not used, yet they go to the trash at home.
They'll identify it in the stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes available in the K-Citymarket Department of Helsinki's Ruoholahden, because many of us, for example, rip off the leafy parts of the flower.
From the box, the magazines are being sold to biowaste.
According to the news published by the economic statements, we are snooping with a vegetable trick to admire merchants.
But how much to remove excess parts of vegetables before weighing really saves money?
How significant is the way of snooping really?
We women test how the price changes when they take off leaves or carry leaves from pineapple, latva-artis, sweets, broccoli and flowering.
The price of the florist costing EUR 2,10 was EUR 1,80 when all the leaves were peeled off.
Ananas: the price of the total pineapple costing EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its stock was turned off.
Latva-artisokka: EUR 2,60 came to EUR 2,40 when the short-term position was cut off.
Herpes: Two sweets cost a total of 75 cents.
The price was 60 cents.
Parsaka: The average broccoli cost 1 euro and without a carry of 80 cents.
End result: If leaves and heels go off, saves a few tens of cents at the best of one anger.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20 per cent.
Thus, the total amount of these purchases would have been EUR 1.20!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - the Brass Star signed a five-year contract with PSG.
The Brazilian laureate Neymar has concluded a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, reports the news office AFP.
Previously, on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid the FC Barcelona, playing at the league of Spain, for an amount of EUR 222 million.
The maximum amount of transfer of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
The previous record was held in Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million from the French Paul Pogba.
Spain was too slow to move earlier on Thursday, when it rejected Neymar's first payment undertaking.
According to the rules of the league, the purchase company cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player itself must buy out his contract, which happens by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and its representatives, who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to be arriving in Paris on Friday.
He may be introduced to a new Home General at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa looks into the details
In addition, Barcelona reported that it provided information on the payment to Uefa of the European football union in order to enable the Union to determine any disciplinary action that might result from the case.
Among other things, the President of the Spanish league, Javier Tebas, has suspected PSG of breaking the rules of Uefa's economic fair game.
Uefa may be punished for the loss of more than EUR 30 million over a three-year period.
According to Uefa, Neymar's transfer does not automatically break its economic course.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG affects the company’s economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell a number of players in substantial amounts, Uepha was reported.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qataran company Qatar Sports Investment.
The Society is chaired by a former tennis pro, Qataran Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Ten shirts for Neymar
Austin, 21, got a lot more burn-down from the lightning strike... the flash was recorded in the airport's security camera.
Austin Dunn was doing normal work measures for an aeroplane in the International Airport of South-Florida with a couple of workmates, when suddenly the rain from the sky hit a lightning on the plane.
The strength of the lightning threw the plane's wing on the land near Dunn.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and said his brother got an electric shock and he's in the hospital.
I was just asking if he was alive, says Austin's sister Autumn.
Austin spent two weeks in a hospital.
He also had muscle damage and stroke in the brain.
The experience was hard for the whole family.
You can't wait that way.
It's traumatizing for everyone, says Autumn.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was at the time of the incident and the transport movement itself decided whether to follow it.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and stimulates business dividends by cutting down
The British training group Pearson announced on Friday that he would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when starting a new restructuring programme in response to pressures on his business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job reductions are mainly made at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019. The company has already reduced 4 000 jobs in connection with previous restructuring arrangements.
Pearson announced that he would again cut costs by 300 million pounds in May as part of his third savings programme, aimed at restoring the weakened business as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month Pearson decided to sell its share of the Penguin Random House to his partner, Bertelsmann, and the company announced that it would keep its outlook for the past year unchanged, and that its turnover increased by one per cent in the first half of the year and stood at $2.05 billion.
Attack in Kabul: NATO soldier died in a suicide attack
A suicide bomber hit a military escort in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul. According to the authorities, he was killed by NATO soldiers and several others wounded.
According to NATO's statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Kabul Qarabah region.
The explosion is the latest violent blow in Afghanistan this month. On Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion in Herat in the mosque.
On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber in the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, an explosion on Thursday night occurred when a joint patrol between NATO and the Afghan army was targeted by a "person carrying a self-made explosive device".
The opinion noted that all injured persons were stable and were treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the letters, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabah are important concerns for the people of NATO near Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, at least one 662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan, of which 20 per cent were killed in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people were killed in suicide attacks in Kabul in an area where they mainly live in Shiiamuslim.
Taliban reported he was behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people died in a bomb attack in central Kabul, which was the most devastating attack on the country's militant group after the United States' leading troops were deported from the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send more troops to the country to assist the local army and police.
According to the writers, recent weeks' suicide attacks in Kabul have also significantly undermined people's trust in the government, its policy and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA will round its decision to postpone the implementation of smoke smoke rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, was rounding up its decision to delay the implementation of smoke-reducing decisions during Obama’s term of office on the day after 15 States had suspensively susived the Agency.
EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called "Oxone Controls" in late Wednesday, and according to the Agency, the decision demonstrates its commitment to cooperation with the States Parties.
"Our faith in the dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the states," Scott Pruitt said in the Agency's opinion.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone determinations by one year in October 2018. According to the definitions, the smoke rate is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the Agency appealed to the Court of 15 countries, mainly those controlled by the Democrats, including the District of Columbia, and according to them it was illegal to postpone implementation.
According to Trump, measures are part of a broader programme for economic growth.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmental protectors who are concerned about the health effects of increasing emissions.
According to the EPA websites, ozone-containing air breathing is "may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leaders had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
Suspects say the bomb was to be taken to the plane on July 15th, but the company was interrupted before the security inspection.
The police won't be more specific about why the company was interrupted.
Another terrorist plan for suspects was to build a toxic-colored gas-separate device and to bring the device into a public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
The Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were caught in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews continue.
Executive Director: Renewable fuels did well
The result of the oil-distributor Neste before the taxes fell, but hit the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to Managing Director Matti Lievosen, the company made a good result in oil products, sales volumes of renewable products rose to record level and the development of the operating profit of the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit improved US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievo, this year, the operating profit for renewable products remained at a good level thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects, and we will complete the strategic investments we have already announced in 2017, Lievonen said in the communication.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatšenko discuss a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomatšenko and Mikey Garcia, who should have a collision course of less than 66,7 km of the most interesting boxing match in the immediate future, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at ESPN Sports Channel offices in Los Angeles until WBC’s undefeated light series champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomatšenko, the master of the upper season WBO.
On Saturday, Garcia won the former four-class world champion, Adrian Broner, by unanimous decision. After that, Garcia and Lomatšenko have been among the five best of the different category boxers on a comparative list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How's it going, master?
Good luck in the fight!"
Lomatšenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on the ESPN channel on Saturday.
When the twin posted for photographers, Lomatšenko's manager, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the match between men would be "a perfect match for size".
"I'm a former hunk of feathers," Garcia reminded me.
"I carried a series higher than [63.5 kg] for the Broner, but I am not so big.
I'm a small 63.5 kilos.
I want to go back to the light series.
He'll have to pick up the light series [60,2 kilos], and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Make their wishes come true."
Lomatchenko agreed.
"Professionalism needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the match should be held on the pay channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomatšenko, according to which Lomatšenko debytoi was later in the light series this year and will be next summer against Garcia (37-0, 30 tyranny wins). Garcia would also be interested to meet Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will take the light series in Forum on 23 September.
"The game could be on the pay channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that they were ready to fight on a channel offering the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
Nobody else wakes up as much attention as anyone else.
I'll be fine with it as soon as we reach an agreement."
Garcia said she appreciated Lomatšenko as a "unrespectable fighter", and maybe she's going to go see a Saturday fight.
Lomatshenko interrupted Garcia's brow and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "in real slow, sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout."
Garcia said he was focused first on displaying force and then boxing.
The men said they felt that they wanted to play between them more and more.
"This is the game we're waiting for.
No other match wakes as much attention and interest.
I am definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomatchenko said he was waiting for him to fight the best. "Mike is a legend.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Medium wage 5 300 euros, training what happens - the situation of investment advice was "crazy and free"
The quality of investment advice has been much discussed recently.
Last time Helsinki Words told Ritva, 68 of whom the bank-restrict investment advisor spoke a full-scale pump when selling investment products.
Investment advisors and various rules on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
These are based on the new Financial Market Directive, which will be applied from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law has not defined competence requirements.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that investment firms carry out their own APV1 or APV2 studies.
The financial sector has been awarded the organisation of degrees for an APV investment survey Ltd, which is a member of both the Financial Supervisory Board (Fva), the experts of universities and industry.
The studies are 12-15 credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, or by Aalto University Executive Education Oy providing management development services.
Its website says that, in general, both exams are "a wide range of requirements".
The study material includes 10-15 books and a number of other books and books.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Studies Ltd, says that the pass rate of the exams is roughly 70.
Most of the employees of major banks have completed either APV1 or APV2 studies because their performance is compulsory according to the company's own rules.
Then there are smaller bank bonds without mentioning the names of whose staff seems to have been affected by the completion of a carded degree, says Savikko.
According to him, these bank movements are "movement".
According to Saviko, APV1 has completed 13 000-14 000 people since 2000 and some 3 000 persons recommended to invest advice.
Some bank bonds consider that the performance of a degree is an advantage.
Several other sectors have significantly stricter skills requirements.
Sackikko says that the financial recommendation requires APV qualifications to be completed, since it is at the time that expertise in the investment sector will be ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors make thousands of euros per month, including benefits and commissions.
The average working time of monthly wages is around EUR 5 300.
On average, men working in capacity earn a high amount of EUR 5 900 per month and women make more than EUR 4 500, respectively.
On average, the tens of people making the most money earn around €8 100.
The tens of men who make the most money earn more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, one tenth of women who are most rich makes EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be given by an authorised company.
To date, the level of work and work has been established for self-regulation.
According to Fiva’s audit, individual cases in which the professional qualifications and qualifications of an investor were insufficient on the basis of the advice’s activities were received.
The seller of investment products can also act in principle even if professional skills and qualifications are at a low level.
On the basis of this, the situation has been wild and free.
A number of other sectors have much stricter skills requirements, says Savikko.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will be accompanied by the new Financial Market Directive (MiFID II).
It requires each company to be responsible for ensuring that investment staff are sufficiently skilled.
Financial supervision, on the other hand, has the power to determine what needs to be known.
Mr Hovi, market supervisor of Fiva, says that one of the clear changes to the current legislation is the requirements for the competence and experience of investment advisors and investors.
According to Hovi, new requirements apply to both investment firms’ own staff and related lawyers who sell products on behalf of a company.
The Court says that according to the Government's proposal by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will be empowered to appoint a candidate for knowledge and experience.
What they are exactly is decided by these visions during the coming autumn.
The company shall also continue to provide the necessary training and, where appropriate, monitoring and continuing training.
All this must be documented, and the company has an obligation to prove that this has also been done.
The Court explains that in practice, for example, the company has to map the personnel’s activities at individual level.
This will certainly have different levels of requirement depending on whether it is investment advice or whether it is sales of products.
According to Hovin, there is also a new requirement to work with someone who is more experienced if knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
In other words, if the company hires a new employee who does not meet well-defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain time.
The change, according to Hovin, is that the rules are tightening and more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.

Imatra Blue Coastal Schools will not stop the rain or the sun’s pope - Iines Allekonen’s knees with the help of the pool.
Until everything went well, Taina Ikkonen followed me.
Imatra Beach Schools run this and next week in Liette and Lempuka.
Even though it rains between the rains and then it shines again, young swimmers are not a mess, the swimmers praise Taina Ikkonen.
In this week’s swimming school, 13 children are surveyed, next week tens of people.
The number of children in the coming week was influenced by the fact that the school and eskar were already starting.
Imatra Beach School is organized in cooperation with Liitua and the city of Imatra.
Thursday, on the beach of Liette's swimming pool, there was a nice atmosphere.
The sun shined and the young swim schoolers trained to stay on the ground with swimming pools, someone without.
The smaller brothers also enjoyed water.
In the meantime, 5 of all, the first thought of going deeper into the water.
However, Taina Ikkonen encouraged her to kneel toward the shore.
You're doing great!
And until he told me he's been in a lot of swimming this summer.
He's good at the beach.
Just like all of us, along with the swimming pyjamas, he was practicing swimming in the darkest way with Vili Huthtinen, 5.
You too will be pleased with the achievements of today, the swimsuit praised.
Jami Kallio, four more times he wanted water wars.
His daughter, Anna Villberg, followed by 6 swims from the beach by Ilona Villberg, considers beach swimming school as a good start to learn swimming.
Even though the weather's been going to hurt, Anna's been in love with me every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The swim school people were packing up for the docks.
With a frog found on the beach, it's enough for the boys.
Milja Luukkunen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread to the docks towels, swept fruit, and plucked the day.
In the water, the teaching continued, but the docks were not in a hurry.
That's the kind of thing that doesn't belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilets, "This is a story that connects us."
You can see it all the way.
Blue product made of cleaning products, you launched a series of unknown military products a few days ago.
So, you know, we're going to have to do dishes and laundry clothes and a "wc-grey on the edges of the brush".
An unknown soldier refers to the film and the marketing of the movie that he's getting this autumn.
However, there is something special in the combination, and the products have been cut off in social media: When will the unknown health bond come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does the Vice President of Sinituotus say about Aino Mää?
We're a movie partner.
We are supporting this film, as are many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, says Määtä.
According to him, the products become a special feature for the movement, and thus the film gets visibility.
Isn't there something funny about this - often when you think that the products and the related stories have something in common?
Yes, there is a similar connection story here that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, Määtä says.
According to him, the company is supported by the same Finnish basic values that support those who have seen an old unknown soldier.
And cleaning is not a stranger to military culture. Määtä points out.
Other partners in an unknown military film include Valio, Hartwall, Salido, VR and Sato.
For example, Hartwall vichyt, which is found in Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela, has been placed on the market so far.
Unknown products have already been submitted to perpetuate Finland Photolehti's blogist Kalle Kinnunen
There's also coffee and watches available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the film's first night, so there is still a promise.
The unknown partners have not yet revealed their war products, for example, the Valio, the Farmer, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunnen writing.
New results of Swedish age tests on asylum seekers were published
The latest results of medical tests for asylum seekers have been published. The results of the tests carried out under the new evaluation method reveal that more than 80% of tested applicants were defined as being over 18 years old, but not all consider testing reliable.
This year, the Swedish National Law Office launched the test.
The tests can be assessed in more detail the age of the asylum seeker. A new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failure to determine the true age of those who claimed to be underage.
To date, the Finnish Immigration Service has conducted 6 880 tests, and the Office has now published the results of 2,481 tests. The tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
The 80% tested, i.e. the 2002 asylum seeker, was defined as having more than 18 years of age, and in addition, 25 cases, were determined by the Legal Medicine Agency that the subject was "may be 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "may be less than 18 years old".
The tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to suspect the age of the applicant.
Johan Göransson, the Legal Medicine Agency, tells us that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly uniform. Big differences in previous months' statistics are not noticeable," he told The Local magazine.
Although much of the applicants were identified as having more than 18 years of age, it does not necessarily mean that the applicants would have lied to their age.
In May, the Agency published the 581 results of the test and announced that 442 cases were "in the case of evidence that the investigator was 18 years old or older".
When the Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it appeared that in 243 the applicant had openly reported that he would be 18 years old this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-ray images of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of knee-belts, and then the pictures of dentists and radiologists are analyzed, and the method has also been criticised.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolin Institute, whose work involves assessing human biological maturity.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I think the method used is not the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't definitely determine the age, we shouldn't pretend we can do it," he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, the Justice Department, defended the accuracy of the tests: "It is common to say that the risk of determining the child as an adult is small.
The risk is greatest in a situation where the test will soon be completed for 18 years, and then the risk will be about 10%."
Ilone collapsed 30 locations in Scotland
In the third round, five over par results were spent on Mikko Ilosen 30 pyjamas in the European tour of golf in Scotland.
Ilonen left on Saturday instead of 11 but was found at the end of the tour to be 41.
Iloselle was brought up in a difficult basement with three bugs following one double-bogg.
The rest of us had trouble, too.
Ian Poulter, an Englishman, rose up to divide the top place one under the par round, saying that there was enough work to do in the umbrellas.
Keli was raw, but I hung with him and finally the day was good, Poulter's ashes.
He's sharing the lead with his countryman Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Doddt.
The governor of Western Virginia to change the party
On Thursday night, the Democratic Governor of Western Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that Trump's campaign event would change the party.
"Democracys simply rejected me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you, after many prayers and in-depth reflections... today I will tell the Western Virginias that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The audience broke out to the culprits.
"To be a member of the Republican Party registered tomorrow," justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that a major announcement would be made at the Western Virginia campaign event.
Trump won in West Virginia at 42 points because Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited his father from a mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
His property is worth about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday night, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued an opinion saying that "the party exchange of Governor Justice is another attack on a democratic party that would rather build obstacles than better America".
"Democracy has only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback to a party that has no leadership and is unable to find a positive, humanly united message," Ronna McDaniel said in his opinion on CBS news.
The lightnings sown from the Thursday, coming even on the very day of the summer.
In the rest of the week, we can also find more holes in South Finland.
Over the past week, we have been awakened especially in the Middle and Northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomen.
The night between Wednesday and Thursday, the lightning strike set several fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may become a very busy summer until now.
The deaf have finally found Finland.
Over the past week, lightning has been in the middle and north parts of the country, and in the region of Varsinais-Suomen.
On the table, the lightning hit the line house's power center, causing a small fire.
The rescue facility received a notification of the fire about 15 until midnight on Wednesday.
The power center was located in the sauna room at the end of the row house.
The rescue plant was canned into a ceiling and wall to find fire extinguishers and then swept the fire out brightly.
In total, eleven homes were left without electricity, but personal damage was avoided.
At the pool, the lightning lit the outside building on the signs in Harjumaa before midnight.
When the rescue facility arrived, the building was already in full fire, and the rescue facility could not stop it from spreading.
The outer building of about fifty square meters burned to the ground.
In the mouth of Kuopio in Rääkkäylä again lightning hit the home house.
The inhabitants of the house were outside the building and witnessed a glamourous lightning.
The rescue facility was on site to check the case, but this time the lightning didn't get the fire in time - only a few of the moltens rushed.
In traffic, the thunder caused problems on the train track between Seinäjoki and Vasa, when the lightning was damaged by the traffic control system.
Information on the fault was received between 8 and 9 Thursday morning, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem could only be corrected shortly before 5:00 p.m.
Since then, rail transport has also been able to continue normally with the thunderous rail section.
The lightnings have sown destruction across Finland.
However, the weather has been relatively small this summer.
These summer thunder stories have been completely infuriable! assesses the suny meteorologist Jari Tuivinen, who is a member of the Air Science Department.
In the midweek and Thursday, the thunderstorms have been mainly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the little secret salad of the summer, it seems powerful even for many.
This could feel really hard, but that's what it's been like compared to this summer's old man," Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, the painting was 1 700 times corrupt, and on Thursday, there has been potential for even the toughest day of the summer: by about 16 p.m., there were 1,790 rural areas in the poster.
If lightnings continue to continue on the early side, then more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, Thomas predicts.
The previous record of the thunder year was held in 2015, when the number of flashes of the year was about 30,000 copies.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning level had risen to 18 386 lightning.
There is, therefore, still something to be attached so that this year does not break the "prereaction" from two years ago.
However, the Ukoskir can be expected to continue.
According to the wind, Finland will also remain warm and wet during the end of the week, which is an acceptable natural environment for the thunderous ones.
The main focus of the old ones will be on Saturday from the northernmost parts of the country to the south, where about 2,000 days of lightning can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
The central part of the country is a more uniform Saderinda.
That's how Touvinen says it's a little bit of a thunder.
Coe congratulates Russia's 'open' apology for dopingscanal'
The World Sports Party Sebastian Coe praised the apology that Russia made on Thursday, due to the doping scandal, but added that it was not yet time to stop Russia's ban on participation.
Ms Shlhhtit, Director General of the Russian Sports, said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday that the ban received by Russia is appropriate and that he intends to fight decisively against doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were taken in competitions for a gold medal or silver medal".
Despite his comments, the IAF Congress voted in favour of continuing the ban. Russia was excluded from the public sports competition in November 2015 after the World Anti-Dumping Office WADA report provided evidence of state support for doping in Russia.
"I think his reply was very direct today. It was a very open presentation," said Coe, IAAF President.
"All the Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation admitted that it had been through difficult times and announced that it would do everything in its power to reorganise its activities."
Mr Coe said that he was "satisfied" also to the fact that Russia accepted the conditions for the termination of the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress, but Congress supports the group's recommendation that this is not the time to end Russia's ban," Coe said.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete on the status of the neutral athlete at the World Cup in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAF.
Rune Andersen, Director of the IAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
"The test is still insufficient and the trainees who received the operating ban continue to operate freely", he informed the editors on Friday after the presentation he had made to the IAF Council in London.
The production company disappointed Tom of Finland's weak success
The Tom of Finland film did not turn out to be as successful as the authors wanted, says Yle.
If you honestly say it, I'm disappointed, to admit that the film produced by Helsinki Film's CEO Annika Sucksdorf Yle at the interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems to be.
The film received its first night in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached a fair 100 000 viewers, which is a small amount compared to the film budget, about EUR 5 million.
This has not become a lottery victory, but now it is important that investors get their own back.
If the movie had been better in the country, they would've already had their money.
Now we have to wait for little bites of foreign distribution, Sucksdorfff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoske.
How football economic rules affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The provisions restricting the use of European football clubs do not prevent the transfer of Neymar from Spain to France, Paris Saint-Germain, which is the most expensive transmission of football from all time.
Its possible penalties for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which can prevent teams from participating in the respected Masters' league.
In 2011, UEFA introduced the financial rules for a fair game, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona for the termination of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar's annual salary in the new year is in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty paying Neymar's transfer amount and attaching him to its maps, as it follows that the Qatar oil-rich ruler family is financed.
Tracks can use large sums of money to purchase players, but they need to be balanced by real income sources so that football-related business is not loss-making.
The economic rules for fair play were drawn up as President of UEFA on the initiative of French Michel Platin, which was elected in 2007.
As a former football player Platini felt that the pursuit of success in debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners supported.
In 2011, the focus of fair play's economic rules shifted from seurai to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich for the first time in Chelsea in 2003 was significantly difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, used huge sums of players' purchases and created a global brand.
The current three-year period of assessment of fair play's economic rules will last until 2018. During that period, the following will be allowed to lose up to EUR 30 million.
Although Platini had to leave the UEFA president's duties scandalously in 2015, his successor Alexander Cefer also wants to control the unsupervised use of the clubs.
"The rules of fair game are still in place, and we will apply them in the future", Andrea Traverso, responsible for the fair game's economic rules in UEFA, told Associated Press News Office last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with one-off compensation, it may be adjusted in the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has concluded a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded at an annual cost of EUR 44,4 million for the next five years.
On the basis of the economic rules of fair play, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014. The largest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Abu Dhab to Manchester City financed.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the company was also ordered to limit 21 players of its Masters' league to 21 players for the period 2014-2015 instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors the clubs that may attempt to circumvent its economic rules by increasing their income through companies linked to the association.
If, for example, the Qatarn company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal market level, UEFA does not calculate the aid as a real income.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatar Tourism Authority for PSG had been oversized.
It has also been shown that some of Neymar's benefits in PSG could be financed by payments available from the FMC's 2022 football event organisation.
However, the PSG and the Board of Directors have denied Neymar to take action from the MMs Ambassador. UEFA would be very easy to reveal such an arrangement.
In view of the earlier PSG sanctions, UEFA will follow more closely the rules.
On Thursday, UEFA has not negotiated with PSG the transfer of Neymar.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press News Office on condition that their identity is not revealed because they do not have the power to discuss the situation with PSG.
According to the latest published accounts, PSG’s net sales for the period 2015-2016 amounted to EUR 542.4 million and operating profit to more than EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to attract new sponsors and increase the sales of follow-up products and gaming shirts.
The company estimates that its net sales will increase by at least 30% under the Neymar Agreement.
From the point of view of the world's best player's departure, Spain too tried to make it difficult for Neymar to move and it was said to break the economic rules of a fair game.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the company and the state," said Javier Tebas, the President of the Spanish league, who referred to the Spanish newspaper AS.
Arsenal’s manager, Arsene Wenger, also has reservations about the state’s financing of football club activities. Arsenal owns an American sports pot.
"The guarantee is the result of ownership, which has changed the football operating environment in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"It's all possible after the state owns the football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the economic rules of a fair game, and there are so many interests in relation to the fact that a famous player represents the state."
Now it is urgent: Finnish MM athletes are stuck in Helsinki
The height jumper Arttu Pajulahden and the tripartite Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, although he should train public sports in the World Cup in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
The shield race is tomorrow in the furry of a long jump and Mäkela on Saturday in the box of threes.
However, the twin coach, the Armenian Ghazaryan, did not receive a visa to Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this in the UK Embassy without results.
The coach has the call of the World Cup organisers as a documentary, but it has not been able to obtain a visa either.
I wonder if this is the first Brexiti symptoms, or what, Coach Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always successfully dealt with visa issues in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Union SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone's looking at the step marks on the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said his coach had a possible absence.
MM Medal for FinlandLonto requires a miracle
The World Cup competitions for sport start in London today on Friday and last a fair week after the end of Sunday 13 August.
General sports, masto skiing and hockey are the species in which Finnish penis athletes are able to take a passionate attitude from year to year, whether it is a success or not.
The hearts of the bench athletes are measured in medals.
Of course, there are other indicators.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from the value race to another, where experience is gained by getting the athlete's performance to the level that adults' MM medal is genuinely possible.
Now, there are no such young athletes in Finland's small MM team, nor are there any teams.
The MM medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Happily, sport’s interest and surprise are that miracles can happen.
It drags the kids to the TV circuit and the glue to follow the races, even though London's medals are solved from time to time only in the evening.
Of the previous World Cup 2015 in sport, Finland received one bonus medal.
That's what the rock thrower Trio Kõmämäki brought.
Even now, even though he and the others have been told the results of the past few times, and the fact that the Long East is to be cut off at last summer's worth competitions.
In these races, however, the Long Mount will remain in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
The other Finnish athletes of the race have access to the final competition or to make their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt of Finnish sport over the coming years will give a good success in the international prizes of young people even this summer.
The processing of young people's talents and the financial support for their work is more important than maintaining a small group of representation athletes' elites.
The success will not come in the moment, but will require the sweatful work of years from athletes and patience, both from training and from bench athletes.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope London's race remains in history as the races of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not for example because of the fear of terrorism or the shocks of the poor.
Enet Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But it's not too bad"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has been stationed in the second big air race in Colorado.
Copper Mountain's second class is the best big air in the world Cup.
The women's race won by Jamie Anderson in the United States.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in competition.
He tried his last jump on the caballieril 1080 for the first time in the race, and it was very close to success.
It feels good and a good file is now, but it's a shame that the last jump didn't go exactly.
I'm going to try it in the race from now on, too, Tuum Rukajärvi.
In the snowboarding big air, the competitor jumps from the jumper made for the species.
Viking Line’s new fastship was hit by a rain in Helsinki
The backup company Viking's new high-speed FSTR is very late on schedule.
The long ship had to leave Helsinki at 6:00 p.m.
There were eight countries on board loading.
The ship was late for Helsinki.
At least a half hour and a half, I've been waiting for you to get on the boat.
Now the car train moves a little, the Estonian waiting for access to the port of Helsinki, Johannes Rebane told us at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought that the new ship had become a technical mistake.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought in water bottles waiting for their cars.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Grönlund tells IS that there was a technical mistake.
It was repaired at the Helsinki port.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed from the return trip to Tallinn for a few hours.
The ship had to leave Tallinn at 20.15.
42-metre special carriage interferes with traffic on the sixth Thursday night
There are 42 metres of special transport from Mooko to Mustola harbour during Thursday night.
The departure from the ninth should be reached by 11:00 p.m.
The police are driving traffic on the sixth floor, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
From the top of the mountain, the transport is on the road to the 13th Street of Mustola.
Small District Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Decive
At the same time, the story of both the 80s and the 90s of spells (times David Wain and Michael Showalter made a brilliant series for MTV) and their own time – 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and other stars of the series moved to bigger things.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the continuous memory we are stuck in during the Facebook season.
As a commercial product, it seems to have already lived.
The First Day of Camp was surprisingly good and not only because of its humor (which was reported as the background story of H. Jon Benjamin’s voice).
The point is that the mid-age actors act as a whole-age-approaching-up-to-life-to-morse, making it a part of the joke that makes it impossible to reach the past.
Ten Years Later, where adults act as adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodys for example 90s of stellar movies, such as a horror movie Hand that swings in the ring.
At one point, one of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates and "other stuff from 1991".
Many stories are the same as before.
Goodhearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has still not been over Katie (Margurie Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And in one of the crazy plots, Ronald Reagan (a.k.a. Michael Showalter) is a criminal partner of George H. W. Bush (which plays well Michael Ian Black).
As always in these series, the best are side paths.
Especially fun is to see the ever-beginning Paul Rudd, who's got a beard under the lower lip, which is Matt Dillon's "soul patch" movie from Singles. Andy Rudd's act of Andy, camp shoes, starts to be an old guy.
The moments of random madness may lead to this series as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until its obvious decision is made: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its last scene, a group of friends will go to the Wet Hot American Summer movie first night.
The Amazon's Combade Dective series again appeals to another kind of nostalgic: The American series's cold war spirit, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the GLOW series's pastry, where the East meets the west.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and it has been directed by Rhys Thomas. It has been made a Romanian police drama in the 1980s, where the bourbonist cop fights for truth, atheism and Marksism.
In the capitals, the tough face of Gregorina and the idealist Iosefina is seen as Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their words have been broken down in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But that's not a lot else, is it?
There are some good visual jokes in the series (the police spend time watching chess on television the same way the Americans watch football).
There are a bunch of famous sound actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahhersala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, the Combade Dective is too attached to the tracking of the socialist drama – for example, there is a covert killer behind Reagan's mask, which is why the series often start to feel really clumsy of propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the sense of humor in the series is not fast enough, and not high enough.
As a dedicated series might work better as an agitprop satier, even if Gregor and Iosef are repeatedly attending the US Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby.
The message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make all consumer goods and fast food.
A series of imaginary Romanian creators were not wrong: our covetous tour of our short history and their history.
The Kouvolalainen Toni Tauru rises in the ring in Macao - against the former UFC player
Toni Taurus wants to keep the fight up.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone in Macao, as the Brasil Leandro Issa was still in the UFC organization last year.
Brazilians also have a Jewish black belt and a world championship.
Once I take myself against the parents.
That's a funny thing, 32-year-old Taurus tells us.
The Kouvolaman had to get up in Indonesia last Saturday.
The fight was cancelled due to logistics problems, but three struggles were received on a quick timetable for China's self-government region in Macao.
It's never happened before.
This was the first time I had a fight canceled.
It was annoying because it took a lot of time to prepare and practice.
However, the complainant is pleased that a new date for the struggle was received.
A week's waiting doesn't have much to do with preparing.
The transfer does not affect the condition, as it does not improve once a week.
It could get worse if you're practicing too much now.
A few of the opponents in their previous struggles have been faced with the strengths of persuasion.
This time, the situation is different.
It's a couvolan described as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I'll bet he's gonna come on top of the first round hard and try to take him to the mat.
He's won a Jew's world championship, so he knows how to go.
The previous Kouvolaan match did not go as planned.
Kevin Belingon, a Philippines, hit Taurus badly in the eye, and the victory remained for the Philippines.
I've never done so much, especially: he's never got a hit.
When I went down, he hit my eye.
It's been a really long time.
New motivation
Some volunteers take once a year, some rise more often.
For example, the future opponent, Issa, was the last time in September.
The Taurus had three fights last year.
Now there's another struggle in front of this year.
Sometimes the pace has become pregnant.
I've trained and been in good shape all the time in recent years.
But I've only been here for a fight.
When the 32-year-old heard about a future encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoo training, and I got the pleasure back.
We got really good workouts with one of the guys from Sweden.
There was a great deal of help from the training, because on Saturday, the Kouvolan will have to prepare for physical struggles.
I've had the same size of training against opponents and training a vertical match.
Stand by is the main tactics of 32-year-olds.
We have to make sense.
If there's a chance, I'll take the place myself.
You can't give lowlife exports for free because they spend the most.
Macao attracts Taurus, who used to be in China.
They say it's China's Las Vegas.
I think there's a big, nice evening ahead.
The Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that it will keep interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been industrious and inflation has stopped speculations at interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to slow down and that the Bank will transfer interest rates because the income level of the families is under increasing pressure.
The decision-makers of the monetary policy committee of the Central Bank decided to hold interest rates by 6 to 2 %, and this month's remuneration was less and less in favour of economic growth.
In its quarterly inflation review, the Bank decreased to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and to 1.6 per cent in 2018; it also warned that the income level of households would be under increasing pressure, as inflation is expected to continue to increase by three per cent in the autumn.
However, in the next few years, the Bank stated that it would be necessary to reduce the inflation of Brexit, and that the loan costs could be increased more than expected on the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package which began to take place a year ago in the ex-post reports on the Brexit vote.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is expected to provide affordable financing to banks through the current programme, which will amount to 15 million more, i.e. a total of 115 million.
The Bank's interest rate protocol states: "The Commission's forecast shows that the slow development of GDP will continue in the next few years, as household real income is reduced by consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need to "encourage certain levels of monetary policy" market expectations "more widely" in order to control inflation.
The markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second quarter of 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that possible increases are 'staged' and 'limited'.
In May, the bank predicted an increase of 1.9 per cent for this year and an increase of 1.7 per cent for next year.
It now held its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The chin was weakened in relation to the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the weight decreased by 0.5 per cent and was $1.31. In relation to the euro, it decreased by 0.4 per cent and stood at 1.11 euro.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged after the expected weaker growth figures depreciated the increase in expectations of interest rate increases by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but it will be a little more than a year ago.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope for up-to-date inflation and low wage increases for households, and according to the Bank, the situation is getting worse before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "can't prevent" the decline in income over the next few years, but it expects wage developments to return to the end of the three-year horizon.
The economy will also be strengthened by strong growth in demand for British products as a result of a weak shortage, which will set aside part of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after the interest rates were reduced to 0.25 per cent after the result of the vote on the EU national vote, which hit the fall in the suit.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to start to be visible in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Before the latest decision by the Central Bank, the interest rates had been set to become more and more pronounced when inflation was tightening the pressure on households, and three decision-makers called for an interest rate of 0.5% in July.
In the last month, inflation suffocated to 2.6% of June from 2.9%, but according to the Bank, it was expected to increase again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, its two-percent target was overrun by a 'total' weak line.
"In view of the recent drop in swap interest rates, competition in mortgage markets would seem to become ever more critical when creditors are looking for customers with a fever and want to stop the year strongly," says Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"Markinas look particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is closing; the renewed agreements are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also unnecessary alternatives."
NHS is prescribed to 10,000 people with anti-dumping drugs.
As of September, patients can be prescribed a ‘supplementary’ anti-HIV medicine. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute concerning the financing of the drug in the UK public health care system (NHS).
NHS reported that pre-exposure prevention therapy (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10 000 people during the first three-year trial.
NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the court court held the Supreme Court's judgment last year, according to which NHS is able to pay the PrEP drug, even though it claims that the local authorities should finance it.
Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS in England, called the announced "a new intervention" on Thursday, and the national AIDS organisation described it as "a crucial moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield begin first to receive registration for an experiment that will expand in October to other clinics. The experiment will reach its full range in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention therapy (PrEP) should be taken prior to co-administration with a HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Experience has shown that PraEP significantly reduces HIV/HIV levels in risk groups.
The medicinal product to be taken prior to co-morbidity means that the body has sufficient substances to prevent HIV infection during co-administration.
You can take your medicine every day or two hours before you have sex.
The treatment target group includes homosexuals, bisexual men and transsexuals, and people with HIV positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
The clinics choose the conditions for the experiment to be met by applicants from men, women and transsexuals and those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive anti-retroviral treatment.
People resident in England and registered as a general doctor may also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs 10 million pounds, and this week the NHS signed a contract for medicinal products after an international tender.
The aim of the experiment is to assess the potential of the PraEP medicinal product by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its application, intake and therapeutic application.
"This significant new intervention should complement and enhance existing, diverse and increasingly active means to prevent HIV," says Stevens.
"It is yet another major achievement in the struggle that has continued for more than 30 years to solve the greatest health challenge of mankind."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, Head of the National AIDS Organisation.
"If PrEP is correctly applied to those who need it and those who are at risk, it may have a reversible effect on their HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, the risk group will receive a medicinal product funded by NHS, which they can decide independently on, without the need to negotiate with a partner, which will have an impact that will have to improve the lives of a very large number of people.
"This was a welcome news. "
"Now it is important to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and no one in the risk group is excluded from it," says Ian Green, Head of Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The product used in the trials has been obtained and we will soon be able to protect 10 000 people from HIV infection."
"The beginning of the PrEP trial is a welcome event, which was completely prolonged for several months due to the slowdown of the government," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the shadow government.
"We have evidence that the medicine may have a reversible effect on our work we are doing to prevent HIV and to stop this threatening disease from spreading.
Experience helps us to understand better the real benefits of the PraEP medicine.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible in the country as possible, so that we can protect HIV exposure and get a step closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully stopped."
Quality of living: intermediate layer and smart decoration solutions have made a home from a small Earl's Court apartment
The former banker Joanne usually moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of the elegant house of Queen Anna's era, which tells us that Joanne has not yet packed up and changed her campaigns.
"This before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something similar in my grade.
I went to the house show and noticed that the rooms were as high as in my apartment there.
I immediately fell asleep, and I made an offer on the same day."
Since then about 90 square apartments have experienced complete transformation.
It was a double where the bedroom only got out of the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and a intermediate layer to make use of the room height.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
They were my demands," he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed Design Office in Notting Hill. Erfan was given the task of using the room space of almost four metres high and creating a apartment that would not only be a repair and sales site but a home.
The room height was not enough for two double spaces, so the challenge was to build a middle layer that was able to stand.
The solution called for creative thinking from Erfan.
"Trail structures are kind of complicated.
The arrangements had to be overrun so that they did not have to be in need of cylindrical.
The structures must be adapted so that the height is just above and below them."
Erfan was able to place the room at the top of the room with its fascinating details.
On the intermediate floor, the retrouvius copper-like window opens up in a stylish living space.
Spare furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille's vintage lamps create a characteristic style.
The use of mirrors brings theatre, condition and light.
The mirrors on both sides of the short corridor make the corridor seem more real.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window with a view to another room.
The mirrored furniture of the entrance has a storage space for Joanne meals and glassware.
It's more of a style that the kitchen can hide when it's not used.
The kitchens equipped with a towing door are not a new solution,
But in Joanne's kitchen, it is unique that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a little planning," Erfan says about a steel-tight slice of the MDF door.
"It's balanced, which means it slides very easily when you lift it up."
Thanks to the smart use and storage of space, Joanne received 16 extra squares, another bedroom, and even better ground solutions.
"When selling property, the area solves – or property appreciation," says Erfan.
"In the case of the estate broker walks into the apartment and lowers the price based on the area of the property."
In Joanne’s apartment, the area was increased by using high quality materials that bring luxury.
"The victim is in contact with apartment materials, and the tunnels in the apartment are partly due to them," Erfan says.
"No one's getting attached to the electrical wires in the walls.
They're important, too, but not the same."
Joanne's apartment is an example of the fact that good design and accessories can make the basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It may also happen so that you don't want to move out of the apartment anymore.
Princess Sofia, who is pregnant, was beamed in her summer box.
Princess Sofia's living bird hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden for the last time before she was born.
To the dinner of the Sustainable Tomorrow event, the princess had chosen a light pink dress.
Sofia represented me as a smiler at the event.
Swedish Princess Sofia has visited Sweden this week in Båstad.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented at the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a beautiful blue body-hungry outfit, which was beautifully dressed as the last pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived at the event in the dark blue housing.
This is the last mission that Sofia represents before she was born.
His calculated time is in September.
For the dinner of the event Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastellinic dress that landed perfectly.
The style was crowned with large earrings and a stylish little bag.
Pasellinic suit as a princess.
Sofia has been on a mission this week in Sweden Båstad.
Sofia was living with a little bag.
Sofia was directly beamed in a fresh summer log.
Sofia even started talking to photographers.
Now I'm just holding on to my stomach, Sofia said, laughing and referring to her end of her life.
He's raising us with a sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, Lahti’s tower appeared home, where Thai food was sold.
The Gulf did not dare to taste. They walked by.
In the home, the food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Pentilä, who were familiar with Panja.
He didn't know much about Finnish, and at that time the Finns still didn't know anything about Thai.
Because the people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free corn.
Thus he taught the Levites to eat Thai food, a spring roll at a time.
Taste it, he said.
I got stuck in a bag of hooks.
I've been more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997 Panja opened her Thai cane in Lahti’s shop hall.
It had two small tables, I think the customer seats were under 20.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to the toilet guest.
When you are hungry and places are limited, you cannot leave empty chairs between yourself and the guest.
We got to know each other better, and we became friends.
Finally, I was sitting on the plate with a dictionary to teach Thai.
Two years went to the mall, but then the restaurant had to change, because the spices themselves made were said to get too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the end of the trade hall.
There's room.
Now we're gonna have to sit in our own tables again, only in the more congested times, we're going to have to ask the guests if there's room next to it.
Panja knows her client.
They're telling him what's been going on and who's been seen.
He knows what food he eats.
He has seen how the life stages of the customers vary and the food club change.
He remembers what a man named I went to eat my first spring roll.
He remembers me thin and fat and remembers what I was like when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my seat next to the kitchen door, and change the hearings with Panja standing in the dishes.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with a sweet chili sauce.
He has opened our taste in addition to our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many people talk to him about the battle - thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panya.
Even though he's been having a hard time, he's always being kind.
He's very busy.
He's going to go to the restaurant work in fungus and blueberry.
Last week at the restaurant, the diaper was celebrated in the past two decades.
We customers got dessert cake.
Without alarm or attention, this was an important day at work.
The finding of the underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to strike in Europe
From the beginning of the year, security authorities received a list of important items for anti-terrorist work.
The list contains more than 170 Isis fighters ready to attack Europe.
According to the German Die Welt magazine, the total number of persons is 173 and the document also includes photos of each person in addition to their personal data.
More than 130 persons mentioned in the list are Iraqi, but six Europeans are also involved.
They come from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Tonight's Sanomat told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information contained therein have been revised.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi Army Special Forces found a list of terrorist personal data and images while investigating the underground base of the terrorist organization in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to the security authorities of all European countries in May.
The background was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in Western countries by terrorists when Isis fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, in addition to the names and images of all the persons, they also have their birth dates, the lowest ones, as well as information from the home country of the person.
There are also specific terrorist specialities on the list.
For example, on the list of German 27-year-old Sami J., the name of the battle is Abu Assid al-Alman, which is German.
He was reported to have left Germany in 2012, first traveling to Egypt, then to Libya and later to Syria through Turkey to join Isisi.
A suicide bomber has been written next to his photo.
There's no more accurate information about the man's fate.
A total of about 6 000 fighters have left Europe for Isisi, whose fate is not certain.

The rescue device's diver found him under the surface, Estlander tells us.
After four o'clock in the afternoon, the rescue facility received the announcement.
The person was delivered to first care hands.
Estlander says he was a 50-year-old man.
Based on the interviews, the man wanted to show us how to swim.
The situation in Tokoinra is over.
Estlander thanked the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Guard Agency and the police.
It was a task run by the Border Guard Agency.
The locals also directed the divers perfectly.
It was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars hit Eura in cars, nine people, three seriously injured.
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of which received more minor injuries, reports the sun - friendly firefighter.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at a crossroads of three at four o'clock in the day.

According to the rescue facility, the crossing area has an hourly limit of 80 km.
Brothers fight over $500 million of real estate property
Two brothers argue that Victoria's largest real estate empire is worth more than 500 million dollars, which is connected to their Italian family 40 years ago to a family enterprise.
Former president of Carlton's football club and real estate developer Colin De Lutis live in Torahk's value range just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the highest court of dispute over the division of property and business property between his brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the divorce is a bitter one.
Brothers and their mother Anna owns 38 properties together, worth more than half a billion dollars, and the family began to collect property when they bought a store from Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded Westco Jeans, which expanded into a chain of 160 motion.
The chain was sold at $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centres.
According to the agreement with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul owns about one-third of the company's wealth. Paul describes his father as "the carrying power and the central character of the family".
According to the legal documents, the division of property means that Colin owns real estate for around USD 316 million and Paul owns some USD 176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties in his proposal for himself," Paul wrote in his first court certificate to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, the case was dealt with for the first time in the Supreme Court after several conciliation undertakings.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says the claim isn't true, and he's blaming Paul for the mistreatment of some real estate.
Colin, together with his first testimonies, writes that he would like to be able to resolve the matter.
"In line with our Italian traditions, the family is most important to me," Colin says in her opinion.
The costs of the case continue to increase. There are hundreds of reports on random statements, e-mails and reports. The case is about investigating consultants such as Deloite, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who set up dairy bars and delicious shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a store from Brunswick.
They were used to convince the family to buy a property from Collingwood, where Colin founded a family's first jeans store.
Colin says that he founded the trade "in the last few years of high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer properties to their boys in harmony.
"Lugig often said that he did not want brothers to end up in court," Anna writes in her opinion.
Two other sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the business of De Lutis Group. Colin says Mark got $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are a "breaker of the economic conditions of their departure".
Colin has kept a low profile, even though he is a former member of the Australian football league board and TV star Eddie McGuir's best friend according to the life story that appeared in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin only replied, and he said in his text that you cannot comment on it because it is being dealt with in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to draw me to the trial in the name of our family," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accept his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to fight this way," Colin continued and said he wished to continue to find a solution.
On Friday, the hope seemed to have passed out.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the media use of the President.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First.
According to the Poltico magazine, the White House's new chief of staff is planning to limit President Trump's media usage and the monitoring of news so that the boss doesn't get so often in trouble.
Editor Josh Dawsey reports:
"When John F. Kelly, new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior staff on his first working day, he took up the main problem which he intends to solve: he intends to limit the availability of information from President Donald Trump.
Kelly told the employees of the White House that all the information, both printed and heard at information events, must be carried through her because the President makes better decisions when good information is received."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media usage and failed.
President Trump has decades of relations with television – and as President, he continues to watch a lot of television.
"If the President-in-Office Trump was nervous about the maladministration of news, it was worth showing him that the co-sponsive media were more balanced," Sam Nunberg, who was a consultant at the Trump campaign, told Politico magazine in February.
Politico journalist Tara Palmer wrote at that time that "the former campaign worker of six says that the use of Trump's Twitter is essential for his personal media flow to include an even flow of chains".
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that Trump's use of Twitter would never be under control.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something we don’t know — maybe the Trump Twiits without their efforts were even more dazzling.
We probably never know what kind of messages Trump left without sending.
If his staff have even been able to stop him from causing problems a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from getting involved.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to drive their affairs by providing Trump with information that supports their views. This information can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisors deliberately provide information to the President.
A reporter named Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
"The present and former employees of the drum say that he can become very upset about the leaves in which he is criticized – especially if they mention harmful data leaks, and then he must find out where the data comes from.
That was the case at the end of February when a copy of the news of GotNews.com, founded by Charles C. Johnson, was issued to the president by someone who accused Katie Walsh of several White House data leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and he had previously spread the wrong accusations and withdrew them later. Nor did he provide concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, after reading the case, Trump had begun to ask about the personnel of Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff of Reince Pricebus and the White House Secretary of Staff Rob Porter "was trying to introduce a system of management of documents that would go to Trump".
And what was the result?
Kelly's gonna try the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump will continue to be his own impulsive self and his assistant.
These unaltered facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract with PSG
The Brazilian laureate Neymar has concluded a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, reports the news office AFP.
Previously, on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid the FC Barcelona, playing at the league of Spain, for an amount of EUR 222 million.
The Neymar agreement with Barcelona was therefore broken down, and he was free to move to the Parisian association with PSG.
The maximum amount of transfer of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
The previous record was held in Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million from the French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qataran company Qatar Sports Investment.
The Society is chaired by a former tennis pro, Qataran Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is believed to be arriving in Paris on Friday.
The success writer, Raija Orange, explained with the hypnosis of alcoholism and fear of flight, "I'm fine in my life"
From the Tv circles Rose time and pure white sheets known as success writer Raija Orane had just spent her 69th anniversary.
The hypnosis helped Raj from Ora.
In addition to their writing, five grandchildren kept their grandmothers, who gave up the sun in Spain and Fuengirola after 18 winter, while her husband and her husband Jyrki gave up the apartment.
First, they sold their house, but now, in the spring, they also left the rental apartment.
From the old circles of light and sun, Raija used to take away depression and alcoholism that she has survived.
The outside is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight went off when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were anti-semitics.
I used to get help with alcoholism about hypnosis, which also made me afraid to fly, I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
The alcohol takes people, the sparkling writer says in the open.
Rajia and Jyrki Orange have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen, who has worked in the tourism sector, has been working together for over 40 years.
I proposed and was married in two weeks, Rajia laughs.
That's the kind of drama queen she's always been. She's finished her life with that, Jyrki laughing at her wife.
Orane made by a large writer only remembers the good 44s pure white varnish TV series that touched and moved the lay-time Finland.
I finally decided to become an industry of the Raikka family in the clothing industry when I read Liisa Seppälä's 50-year-old interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of the sewing machine myself, and my mother also had a clothing business, and sometimes I act as mannequin, Orane recalls.
He thought of a series of plans and a story changed the attitude of Finns to entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's investigation and claim revealed it, Orane says.
Raija Orange lives as an active writer, has many manuscripts under his work, hundreds of ideas.
The Kiertos returned to the alley of the millions of them.
The richest owners of Western Madrid are once again bloated with self-sufficient tourers who were able to cross the town’s branch and return to the fields next to the houses.
The Kiertos parked 20 of their trailer near the street called a millionaire alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the valve of the municipality, which they brought with them children, horses, and the army of vans.
The Kiertians managed to cross the road barrier at a point that had been left unprotected because of the path.
The desolate residents have accused Solihull's municipality of "permanent inability to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident tells us, on Monday night, about Bentley Heath, where they had thrown passers on stone.
"It must be hard enough to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The Kiertians were here in May, then they left but returned again.
They became more tonight and probably even more today."
The resident reported that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to parks.
"Asun Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrated to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the circulars returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them than ever, and they even put the horse in the park."
According to the informant of Solihull municipality, the municipality is aware of illegal camping in the vicinity of Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with the Solihull Police to evict campers as soon as possible.
From the point of view of gathering evidence, it is very important that as many local authorities as possible report to the police about disruptive or criminal activities.
It will help to create an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
The degenerate people surrounded the Portuguese destroyer
In Portugal, men who have been forced to land on the beach full of people have been interviewed in court today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the forced fall.
Two men flying a plane may be charged with the death penalty.
At the lowest, it can be taken into custody in Portugal for 16 years.
The men’s flying miniature had to make a technical error due to the forced landing on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the event, some of which ran out of the landing plane into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and a eight-year-old girl who died immediately.
The machine first hit the man who was on the back of the machine.
Immediately after the plane rose up, and when it landed again, it hit the child’s head, told the Philip Janeira Jornal de Noticias magazine on the beach.
The little girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
The girls' parents didn't get hurt.
On the beach, the small machine was surrounded immediately by angry people.
The girl’s father and other people went to the plane and started hitting it, told the case in Celia Rocha Correio da Manha magazine.
He called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle that no more people died.
The two men in the plane were not injured by the forced landing.
The Finnish star who lost his leg tragically won the World Cup again: "I would not be world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari will celebrate early Wednesday morning at the World Cup competition held in Big White, Canada.
The Great Hamar also won the Cross World Cup in the race earlier.
All of the MM titles have already come up with three.
Pretty incredible World Cup!
Two times the gold was handled, with a good heart rate, the Great Hamari was delighted by telephone.
A 30-year-old counter thanked his coach and was very successful in preparing in Finland.
According to the Great Hamar, the number of interviewers in the species is increasing all the time.
The whole paralithy has grown and developed a lot lately.
The differences are decreasing and there are many new calculators involved.
He always wonders if someone's gonna come after a black horse.
Every race seems to be a different winner.
Great Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been eager to count with his friends since he was young, and the accident did not take his desire to get to the front.
After all, it's about time and again that what my life would be like if it wasn't for that accident.
But it's always been my attitude that it's useless if you don't.
The cards are played, which is divided, the Great Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to lead a serious accident and the loss of the limb into a lucky kick, and Great Hamari would not do it either.
But he turned the hard way.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned into a victory.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Big Hamar's biggest boarding facility was already climbing.
The dome went to the top only after the accident.
When I was young, I was training with guys, and we were always excited about killing X-Games.
But they were far-reaching wounds that went down for some time.
After the accident, I found myself in some way from the X-Games launch.
I wouldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old and I was wondering if this was gonna be a really long life if I stayed here to be bitter and sad.
I decided to pull the hammers and start working.
I'd say I've done quite well.
The shooter was very pleased with the biker Leo-Pekka Star choosing to be a year athlete.
Four-time Olympic winners received their prize at the January sports gala.
According to the Great Hamar, the star victory is an important signal for the parasports.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
I'm sure this will also open eyes to the parasporting world.
When is it time to launch a double world champion Matti Big Hamar's year athlete campaign?
Then we'll see it in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
The Great Hamari hasn't taken all the peaks he's ever wanted.
Next year, there's a big goal.
A year later, Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
They're going to get the medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return permanently to their homeland unless the war ended and Isis left the country.
The Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey examined the views and attitudes of Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees hiding bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return permanently to their homeland.
They say that the end of Syria’s war and the departure of Isis from the country are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
Trump's regime is not seen to bring a change to the Syrian conflict.
The Communication Office chain Burson-Marsteller examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying Arab opinions and attitudes for nine years.
This year, the Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey examined the opinions and attitudes of Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
The survey was carried out in February-March 2017 by a total of 400 Syrian young people aged 18-24, half of whom were women and half were men.
Half the interviews took place in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
42 per cent of respondents thought they could return to their homeland and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the young people’s decision to return to their home is most affected by the war in Syria and the presence of Isis in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most impressive factor in the permanent return to the home, while the fourth most important thing would be the departure of Isisi from the country.
Only less than one tenth will make it the most important factor for the decision to improve the economic situation or to leave Syria for Bashar al-Assad.
Military action alone will not resolve conflict
Syrian youth was asked what is the most important factor in the end of the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more important than the abandonment of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair quarter considers the President of Al-Assad to be an obstacle to the peace treaty.
Almost half of the efforts are being made to put an end to the current Syrian conflict, both political and military solutions are needed.
In order to resolve the conflict, only military action does not believe that a fair quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugees will see Isis's power weakened during the last year, while the fifth will feel its power strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important fight against Personals, and usually terrorism, is that the media would convey to people information that Isis has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many raised military measures as a priority and training reform.
In the opinion of the tenth public, it would be most important to create better paid jobs for young people.
In asking for the impact of Trump's administration on the Syrian conflict 66 per cent of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump regime.
Almost every fourth believes that the Syrian conflict is worsening during Trump's period.
Two divided opinions on whether Russia and Iran have improved or deteriorated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coded to keep the Internet in order - the database he developed uses, for example, Wikipedia and Google
MariaDB is developing an open source database for "the fastest growing world".
The main product of MariaDB, founded by the Coder company Michael "Monty" Widenius, does not cost users anything, and can be developed via the Internet by any advanced programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but paying customers are not necessarily.
Through databases, huge data flows remain in order and quickly available.
If you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com for example, they use MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, acting as technology director of MariaDB, spends about half his time coded.
A man who performs beautiful hand-to-hand distances will help to ensure that the Internet works in a smooth way.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database with MySQL in Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL a billion dollars, and a year later, Oracle lost the software to Sun by 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle trade happened, a large part of the MySQL developers reported that they were leaving.
"They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not give a certain promise of the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already set up a company that began developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired the twenty best developers from Sun to make sure that the code continues to be secured with the help of the same friends who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
The Foundation was set up to monitor the freedom to monitor the development of the MariaDB code.
"MySQL did not make these assurances," Widenius regrets.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL billion trading, few Finns know nothing about MariaDB.
"For the last few years, our growth rate has been around 50% a year," says Ms. Kennedy Paqvalén, Financial Director of MariaDB.
MariaDB, focused on growth, does not yet make a profit, and Paqvalén is a lack of recognition of the company.
To that extent, he reveals that in the current accounting period, MariaDB estimates that he will receive EUR 20 million of orders.
As the database is free of charge, the company has developed services around it, from which customers are ready to pay.
MariaDB will also help exchange databases, which may be more than a year's career if the customer has used a closed database.
The switch from MySQL to MariaDB will succeed in the moment, as they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in South East Asia DBS are MariaDB paying customers.
The most popular cloud services such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in Linux operating systems distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections to the biggest gamblers.
"Our customers include the world's largest television operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central bank", Paqvalé's list.
There are still giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP in their closed databases.
Oraclele also has a modest side business compared to the traditional closed database of the company.
According to Gartner, although the largest database companies have lost their market share in recent years, the number of players such as MariaDB in turnover is still insignificant, although the rapidly growing seals.
About $50 billion on the database market, open source databases don't even cover billions.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in money, as most users do not pay for any of these software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies already develop more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been replaced at that time or at least the transition would have been initiated.
Large companies will not receive new customers because most will choose the open source code next.
This has led to the fact that licence fees for commercial databases have jumped into the clouds.
The companies want to make as much money as they used to do with a smaller number of customers," Widenius thinks.
Since the exchange of the closed database is of little importance, most of the customers' companies have been subject to a price increase.
"There are many customers to whom the transition is really difficult because their old applications and others are closed in the database," Widenius says.
He still believes that the size of the customers is coming up.
When licence fees rise every year, the customer will sooner or later move to the open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent from the previous, and the service is better, as the customer can easily change to another database if he wants to.
In addition, many companies are facing major system changes when they transfer their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, many will exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received €25 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries ever.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now about to hire more.
One of the reasons for the EIB’s financing was the effect of MariaDB on public procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example, in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually on databases.
"A number of countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax money more effectively," says Paqvalén.
Widenius is upset about how money is spent in Finland, for example, on closed health care systems, when open systems are cheaper, and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that the open source code is ideology, but I think it's a better way to make a code.
The community helps and does something that itself can't come up with or do.
55-year-old Widenius belongs to another Finnish Linux developer Linus Torvalds, along with the most well-known open source promoters.
Widenius helps other companies develop operational business models and open source codes.
I still keep 4-5 speeches each year around the world on this issue.
Italy hardens its attitude to civil society civil society emergency services
Italy has warned NGOs who save refugees in the Mediterranean that they should not continue their activities unless they undertake to comply with the new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to see how they could continue their activities", Minister of Interior Marco Minnitti said at the meeting of the Torino La Stampa newspaper.
Minnit's warning came on the day after the Italian authorities had seized the German Jugend Retet ship, and its crew was suspected to cooperate with the human vehicle traffickers who were involved in illegal immigration.
Only a year of assistance was refused to comment on the detailed charges of Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosion.
"The rescue of human lives is and will be of great importance to us, and we are very sorry that we are not currently in a position to act in the search and rescue area", the organization announced in its opinion on social media.
"We can only assess the accusations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had observed the Iuventa vessel of Jugend Retet since October.
The crew was suspected to have taken refugees directly from human traffickers who re-used the boats.
One of these cases is said to have occurred only a few kilometers from the coast of Libya, and the information appears in a document published by the prosecutor, whose content has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have attacked the Italian Coast Guard, which will monitor rescue measures in the region, and is considered to be a motive for support.
According to the Guidelines, ships such as Iuventa should be accompanied by an Italian police officer who controls operations.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that it would consider new rules unnecessary but unacceptable because they would not cause significant changes or obstacles to the rescue of the organization.
Among those who refuse to follow the guidelines are Nobel Prized Doctors without Borders.
In turn, it pointed out that the number of migrants arriving in Italy through rescue measures has fallen dramatically over the last few weeks, as it shows that measures to strengthen the coastguard of Libya and cooperation with local mayors are starting to produce results.
"In the last few days, there has been a light on the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He revealed that in this month's plans are to continue discussions with the city leaders of Libya on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees moving towards Europe.
Mature worker suspected of killing his open partner on Enontekio, suspect found a case on the painting for the prosecutor.
The suspected crime took place in Enontekio's Vibe last December.
According to the police, the 36-year-old Czech man was suspected to have killed his 26-year-old Scottish partner.
In the past, it has been reported that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told me that after what they did, the suspect would have escaped with two dogs to the ground.
The man was found frozen in the painting, and he did not do the resistance when he was caught.
We have to bring the charges up in less than a week.
The case may still be found in the Laap court during August.
Robert Hardy, well known for Harry Potter and all of my friends, is dead.
Robert Hardy, the British actor, is dead at 91.
On Thursday, this family reported the death of the actor.
Hardy, born in 1925, started his acting career at the 24-year-old theater.
During his long career, he also played on movies and television.
Hardy is especially remembered for the role of magic minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter's film and his veterinary role in the Allenkarvae TV series based on James Herriot's book.
In total, the popular series of BBC was recorded through seven.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to prison for text visits to suicide.
The Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls that she thought she had made her boyfriend commit to Conrad Roy's suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, executes 15 months in prison and five years in parole.
Carter was convicted of killing in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13.7.2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said in Thursday's sitting.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter applied for a change of judgment and was able to wait for an application to be dealt with in freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy are suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and cream-colored buffer, listened to the hands of his sentence in a crucifixed look on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He decided Conrad's life to heal his own.
He has not taken responsibility for this," the prosecutor continued.
"He has not shown regret."
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was due to the "serious circumstances that Carter is deeply regretting".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter had no significant influence on his actions at age or maturity or even mental health.
The prosecutor read Conrad's mother's statement, Lynn Roy, where my mother told me that "it's not gonna take a day to die of my beloved son's death.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can survive all this. I will try to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear."
Conrad's sister, Camdy Roy, told the court that she's "supervised" the idea of never seeing her brother's wedding or being aunt to her children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain will never hurt," Camdy said.
The case seems to be a preliminary case, because there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that would commit suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in the car in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter had asked his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text.
"I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages that he had sent Roy in the two weeks prior to his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at that time.
Just a little before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter applied for attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has been divided into experts' opinions.
Only few have defended Carter, one of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30 who was convicted of the murder of his fellow British roommate in Italy in 2007.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion paper where he says, "Michele Carter needs sympathy and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary-General: Break to Russia worst then cold war
The military union between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commenting Ms Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I believe that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Mr Stoltenberg said at the CNN interview.
After the Cold War ended, we hoped that we would be able to work closely with Russia.
However, especially after the illegal accession of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability of Russia in the eastern Ukraine have deteriorated significantly due to NATO's relationship with Russia.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to acting so as not to tighten its tensions.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid aggravating the situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump was able to identify the U.S. between Russia and the United States as being at even dangerously bad levels.
Trump urged us to thank the countries for their bad-looking Congress, which adopted the new sanctions against Russia last week.
The audit will make changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to a back strike experienced by car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement BMW offered to update over 350 000 car software.
The director of BMW said that the company believed that "there are even more rational alternatives than driving restrictions". He referred to European cities, including BMW's hometown Munich, who are considering restricting or prohibiting the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that he had made changes to the engines of more than three million Mercedes to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke about the return call.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed diesel vehicles in Europe and in the United States in order to meet the CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emission neutralizing devices will increase, so it will be difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being observed closely, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of contributing large car companies and overcoming problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's flaws. Volkswagen installed cheating devices in cars that reduced emissions to the standard tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Several leaders of Volkswagen have been charged with prosecution in the United States, but the actions of the leaders are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former manager of the Audi Motor Development Directorate, responsible for thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a possible trial.
Previously this year, the Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, and the authorities suspected that the Audi had installed a system that could circumvent Europe's emissions requirements, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audit investigation can significantly undermine Volkswagen’s position: the manufacturer’s share of Volkswagen’s profits is disproportionately high.
Venezuela's vote began with a lively survey, big demonstrations in the promises
According to the company, the number of voters notified by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of real voters.
This is an unforeseeable opinion from a company that has no role to play in the election result, the chairman of the National Election Commission, Tibisay Lucena, said to journalists.
Maduro assures the end of the crisis
On Sunday, in the contested vote in Venezuela, representatives were elected to amend the Constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised protests against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has delayed its own demonstrations so that they are in progress at the time of appointment.
According to the El Pais magazine, national security forces started local time on Wednesday nights to take over the parliamentary building of the country.
The aim is to ensure the safety of the appointment event.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Laventel has become a symbol of South-France's Provence region, but now it's threatened by climate change.
Laventel had decreased due to drought and disease - researchers and farmers are trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Laventel is directly at risk in the Province of Provence because it has suffered the effects of climate change in recent years, with a clear reduction in the rainfalls of spring and especially autumn," says Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPAM research institute in Provence, specialising in agriculture.
"This will shorten the life of the lavanel.
In addition, the drought has brought in many small cats that spread microbacters."
The stakes are tough.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly desired ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"We now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or are completely missing", Chaisse says.
"In other words, parts containing essential oil are even less."
The solution will be sought by enhancing watering, slowing down of soil moisture and by spraying a mixture of clay and water that protect plants.
The murderer's murder is a growing threat in Mexico
The delivery of the Riodoce newspaper which will appear once a week usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in the State of Sinai.
Today, however, we are discussing safety because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been asked to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which one is safer: leave the children home or include them in the delivery that took place in 2009.
Safety experts have written three words on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask suppliers for names in each group; there is no need for evidence, observations and feelings.
They're the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected to be on government or drug cartels' pay lists, who are criminals who make Mexico's chaos life-threatening.
According to the Consumer Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since the entry into office of President Enrique Peña Nieto in December 2012.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardes, founder of Riodoce, supplier and source of inspiration.
Valdez wrote together a number of books on drug abuse.
He is deeply missed, even though he is present everywhere. Riodoce’s building is covered with a huge picture of Valdez’s central finger. In this picture he reads: “Justice.” The 30-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts, which are decorated with Valdez’s smiling faces. Valdez has eyeglasses and a brandy-shaped colony hat.
The meeting will be held for less than two months after Valdez's death and journalists will discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia about their fears.
In 2010, the Federal Prosecutor's Office was established, in particular for the handling of suppliers' cases, but according to the Committee on the Protection of Suppliers, only two charges have been brought up so far.
Infrequently, journalists are brought to trial, as well as thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime every year only rarely end up in court.
Riodoce journalists are going to continue writing about the violence in Sinai, even though they are broken down by grief and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is of little use, because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why this is happening."
Valdez had withdrawn from the delivery of Riodoce in the capital of the state in Culiacan in the morning of 15.5.2017.
He had driven only a few blocks of his red Toyot, when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The amount was supposed to be linked to the magazine's name: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter was driving away with Valdez's car, and he's gonna tear it down a mile away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She died of a wife and two grown-up children.
The rumors move fast and pay freely in Culiacan.
But Valdez's death is a mouse silence.
Salaloa has been one of the most bloody battle fields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
On the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are shot to death every day, and the funeral ground has the decorative double-layered tomb buildings that are larger than many houses.
The state on the coast has a "symptomatic" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoce, Ismail Bojorquez, 60 years old, feels guilty of being unable to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published a Damaso Lopez interview, leading a competing group that will fight the boys of Guzman.
The case may have upset the boys of Guzman: suspected customers bought every issue as soon as the paper came to the sales points.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same case was under attack.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Norway when he decided in 2003 to set up five colleagues in Riodocen. The magazine’s shares were sold at that time for $50.
In Sinalo, "it was impossible to make journalism without addressing the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
In time, the magazine began to feel brave and honest about its stories, and its sales and advertising revenue grew.
The journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing a hard class of research journalism without fear of the centenary, and readers were fascinated by news that no one else had the courage to publish.
After eight years of his creation, Riodoce won the highly respected Maria Moors Cabot Prize for news in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez received a prize for the international press freedom of journalists for his courage to follow the story of Mexican drug trafficking without being so sensitive.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to go on with my life," he said when he received the editors' protection committee's prize.
Drug trafficking is a "life-style" in Sinalo, Valdez said in the interview on the Rompevito TV last October.
"The sponsor must accept a falling mission – or play dumb.
I don't want anyone to ask me where I was when death was sown here – why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Riodoce staff need Valdez — a joker who cursed like a port worker — who always needed a friend who had a hug and advice, who needed a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routines.
He always used the bridegroom.
He visited the delivery at the opposite El Guayabo bar and always sat on the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were to be his fate.
The death of a colleague has also led them to consider how best they can do their work and remain alive.
"The criminals don't like it if we deal with their women and children in our cases and their pure business, their secret drug trafficking runways.
They were left out of the case," Bojorquez says.
In the best case, it meant strong self-sufficient and self-protection;
Trusting your instincts.
If it feels like everything's not right, you have to stay away.
According to Andres Villarreal, the problem with Riodoce's supplier is that "the impression can be failed, and that's what happened in Javier's case".
The old rules are no longer valid in Sinaloa, nor are they valid in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce's security training was held, and a few days earlier it had become evident that only the spying programmes sold to governments had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had applied for protection from 40 degrees above the tree.
The Government of the State had ordered them to guard the premises of Riodoce, located in a four - story building in the middle class of Culiacan.
Some of the journalists were considered to be half a game, whether these two policemen were part of the 50% that the governor of the state did not consider reliable.
It had been months since the journalists had been in possession of the drug gangs in the mountainous countryside.
This week, the delivery of Riodoce planned three main issues.
The box size of Julio Caesar Chavez's brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The magazine also intended to reveal that government spending on money was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, together with Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block away from the DA's office, there was a kidnapping group of people.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in favour of both drug dealers and public authorities.
The supplier found out from the public documents that the restaurant had been registered with the main institutional revolutionist (PRI) in the name of the politician, who has managed Mexico's policy at all levels for almost a century.
These governors have recently been accused of corruption in cases that have been subject to much publicity.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous cases in the same place, one of them El Chapo's son, Guzman, managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez had reliable information about the kidnapping.
"We would have already known what had happened," says the 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been taken care of because of his body structure by the favourite "El Flaco", Ohukainen.
"Now all connections to our data sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse that preserves signs and labels against the persecution of journalists. Page workers have received a new, unexpected task: they have become activists with freedom of the press.
The editor, Miriam Ramirez, took a few signs with him the next morning, in front of the local prosecutor's office, to a demonstration that was again responsible for the murder of a new journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez's murder in the West Micah State.
After disappearing, a burned body was found that was Adame based on DNA tests by the authorities.
Journalists have begun to protest more often throughout the country. In demonstrations, there are "SOS Press" texts for pedestrians and buildings.
Today Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to receive international support for the study of the Valdez case.
On the day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they were telling the truth.
Since then, he has asked that he be moved away from matters dealing with the government because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that, in Mexico, journalists were surrounded by organised crime, by the authorities allowing crime and an uninterrupted society.
In his last book, Narkojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also being killed by politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Articulo 19 monitoring group, more than half of the attacks on suppliers last year were made by the police and authorities.
"In the max, people will be silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
The murders have a devastating effect.
No one forgets the death of a blogger, Maria Elizabeth Macias, in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body had a message signed by Zetas Cartel: "I'm here because of my writings."
There was a computer keyboard and headphones next to his cut-off head.
Some of the magazines have decided to cease their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the North of Chihuahua border state, after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach.
Some continue their activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message on his front page to drug cartels: "What do you want from us?"
Some suppliers have fled their states or the whole country.
It's hard.
It is difficult to find work in the country, and we must be careful all the time.
Sometimes criminals are looking for a reporter, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in the apartment in Mexico City for three months after he escaped from Vracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra — who was once to be a poet — admits that writing drugs scares me.
"I became a reporter because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce journalists sat before the delivery at midnight on a sidewalk beer when the latest issue of the magazine was completed. Suddenly, their phones began to signal the colour of the message.
19 people were killed in a shooting between the competing gangs and the security forces in Mazatlan's beach destination.
The war accelerated, as promised in the messages of the cartel found in the area.
The journalists put the news on the Riodoce website on their mobile smartphone.
It was supposed to be the next day.
The sirens float around — another shooting.
Bojorquez observed delivery of guarding cops:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
The delivery of Riodoce continued under this massive portrait of the murdered founder of the magazine, where a man shows the middle finger for the whole Sinalo.
Bojorquez says that you can't even consider stopping the operation. "How can I stop the magazine when our intern asked me to get to the street to do the thing the same day that Javier was murdered?"
The Olympic Olympic project in Hannu Manninen began with a huge setback...
In April 39 - year - old Hannu Manninen’s party remained short, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympics.
However, the exercise period began disastrously when Manninen became infected with flu.
It began a long period of illness, which was almost five weeks old.
In practice, May went completely ill.
First, it was flu, and finally, a pediatric disease like ear infections that I had to eat with antibiotic.
I was only able to do 10% of the planned exercises.
I don't remember the last time I've been so sick.
There was a hell of a place when I couldn't take advantage of the practice, Manninen's gonna tell Ilt-Sanom.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 world champion only received a training permit in the second week of June, which was reflected in the KIHU non-rolling test by the Kilpa Research Centre on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis with rollers on a carpet with an increase in speed every three minutes.
After each three minutes, the carpet stops for about 10 seconds, and the tester takes a milk acid sample from the finger of the athlete on the needle.
Last autumn, I spent 32 minutes on carpet, but now I've only stayed 28 minutes.
Fire against the wall, Manninen tells me.
Right direction
After the crimes, Manninen tells me she's still healthy.
I've done a wide range of peaceful aerobic exercises that I've been trying to normalize your body’s metabolism.
Now there's a really good five-week episode behind it.
It was also a week and a half off flight.
I also had time with my family to visit the cabin.
In the last period Manninen only took part in four World Cup competitions prior to Lahti's World Cup World Dogs.
The best result was immediately seen at the opening contest when Manninen rose to 18th at the peak.
Directions drawn
Manninen and head coach Petter Kukkenen have made a training and competition plan until February.
Now we're going to get a different rhythm compared to the last season.
After the premiere race, Ruka would have three World Cups weekend.
In December, the aim would be at least one weekend of World Cup, perhaps in Ramsa.
At the end of January, plans would still be in Seefeld.
I hope after that, the name will be found on the Olympic Team's list, Manninen says.
The Pyongchang Olympics would already be the Six-Seven Winter Olympics for Mannelle.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, the nomad undernegade who celebrated gold in Salt Lake City 2002 at the team competition.
Dinosaurus shielded himself from his enemies by masking
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now researchers have revealed the first results of research from the finding of a Canadian miner of horns, which was so well preserved that experts called it Mona In addition to dinosaurs.
It was so well preserved that researchers could even define that its skin was red-brown and had had a "problem past".
According to the Current Biology magazine, it has been the best preserved dinosaur and representatives of the best species in the world.
Recently found fossil is a nodosaurus, which was 110 to 12 million years ago during the mid-term.
Researchers view this as a truly remarkable finding of this amazingly well preserved fossils.
According to the National Geographic magazine, the armored vegetable eater is the most preserved fossil of all time in its species.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium Mine in North Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was a mineman named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to examine its findings more closely.
The fossil found in the Kallio was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
For six years, the beast was dug out of a hundred kilos of dragons.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
"If you stretch your eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping," says the scientist Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at Tyrrell's Royal Museum.
"It remains in the history of science as Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Nahan’s studies revealed that the dinosaurs eating meat were likely to be a major threat to this plant eater, even though it had a panzer and reminded a walking tank.
Its red-and-white panzer masked it from predators, and it also protected it from darker and lighter coloring, which continues to occur in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to mix with its environment and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million - year - old Nodosaurus rose to the headlines in May, and it is now on display at the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
Researchers have named it Borealope as a markmitchell museum engineer according to Mark Mitchell. Mitchell was part of the team that took over 7 000 hours of digosaurus.
Nodosaurus has remained so amazingly well that Mitchell and the international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body filters and tanks.
They found that it was still protected by a general coloring in the animal world, where the body is darker and lighter than the body.
However, the detection was a surprise because Borealope is significantly larger than the current animals with a similar color.
From that point of view, the dinosaurs eating meat were so preyed on that evolution favours survival as a way to hide instead of fighting.
The current animals, e.g. peuros, serpros and armadilles, have a similar coloring, which is significantly smaller and therefore easier to catch, which suggests that the nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
"The capture of a large, heavily-roasted dinosaur tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs of the accession season were," Brown says.
The chemical analysis of the nodosaur nodes’ organic compounds reveals that its skin was red.
Scientists continue to study nodosaur to draw conclusions about its life, including its contents, to find out what it ate with its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into the river and went into the sea where it sank into the seabed.
Alberta was as warm as Florida today at that time, and the rivers and seas are likely to go much further than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really important, because its Finnish skin has been preserved and has also been kept in its original three-dimensional form," Brown says.
"That is why it looks almost the same as in the early accession period
It does not require much imagination: if you stretch a little eye, you can almost believe it was sleeping."
The marriage season was the age of the teropods, the vast two-legged, fat dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyranosaurus rex, that is, millions of years earlier from Borealopta, their great predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of Tyranosaurus Rex included, for example, the Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings of Nodosaur’s researchers have been published in the Current Biology magazine, and they believe Borealop was suffocated after his death and mutilated into the mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium Mine in North Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was a mineman named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved dinosaur with its skins and panzers from the end to the hip.
The Nodosaurs were on average five metres long and weighed up to 1 300 kilos.
Two half-metre peaks were raised from their warehouses.
Scientists believe that this armored plant eater passed through the present Western Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has preserved small details in the sea grave.
Its fossilised remains have remained so well that its skin is still in the thick sheets of the panzer along its skull.
So Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such preservation is "a rare thing as a lottery victory.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
There's still a Fossil skin on the hoofboards of that skull.
Its right edge is on its side, five toes up.
"I can also count its foot-stools."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Who do the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9.8.2014.
He had arrived in New York earlier from his home in St. Louis and sat on his airbnb apartment bed and served Facebook on his phone.
And then he noticed the message he had in high school:
"Police killed an 18-year-old, and his body is still on the street."
He was confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information on his feed, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had a number of re-wires from the user @TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to a rapper in St. Louis who bled Michael Brown's death in real time, and the white police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black guy in Brown Ferguson, Missour State.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown's living body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he returned to Twitter the other night, people were told to gather on Canfield Drive.
The users posted pictures of police closures and screaming people, as well as Brown's father, of the man who claimed himself to be wearing the sign, and said, "Ferguson's police just killed my boy without a gun!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video where the police stood before the protestors with a barking dog.
He also tells me he's seen a video where another police officer set up his rifle and shouted, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers that he said.
"It was not the kind of murder we've been used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt cold colors.
I was angry, and I cried."
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
Ferrell came to pick up his six-year-old daughter's father and decided to leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years has been a documentary film "Whose Streets".
The film is a story of survival and demonstration of mind, love and loss, and strength and gloomy from the perspective of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove toward Ferguson and his daughter, who was in agreement with the crown, went back to the debate on "what kind of life is black and what conditions." They had spoken about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers his words to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't leave my daughter alone," Ferrell told me later.
"This day's events are... the peak of past events.
My daughter has the right to know it and to grow up to it.
He must be prepared for activation and organization, but he must also know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of black man-made life, and he must know what we must do to get rid of ourselves.
Even though I've been lucky to protect her from dirty racism, she's still the same as other black girls.
I feel like I'd hurt her if I protected her from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, which is located opposite the police station, became the campplace of activists, waiting for information on the case to be handled and eventually learned that no charges would be brought against the police.
That's where Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunch bags and distributed them to the protestors.
Ferrell began to respond gradually to activists in a new way.
"At the University of Missouri at St. Louis Ferrell was the chairman of the medical school of minorities. At that time he focused on food law and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience in organisation.
Somehow it just happened."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with Sabah Folayan at the evening demonstration, a document manager.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrarr "just wanted to tell you" what was happening.
Ferrell's mind is a little suspicious, and he said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use for good?"
The suspicion was caused by countless times when people appeared in the local community, usually by white people who only wanted to benefit from its hardship and sinfulness.
"We heard that the people who were born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice," Folayan recently told us at the interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis, who is known for his activity in the death row.
Davis' involvement brought Ferrell into the project together with six other locals, and the description team followed events during the years following Brown's shooting.
"This is not a document where someone talks to us or speaks for us, but we talk," Davis says.
"To me, the most important thing was how local people are presented in a movie, because I'm presented in the same way."
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience, because it was intended to show that "it is not a charismatic leader but a community", but Ferrell proved to be more transparent.
Therefore, the document is seen as a surprising private part of Ferrell’s life, such as love and marriage.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when he told me what it felt like to see the movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human characterisation of black men require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story times and brings back the role of the black queer women at a wider Black Lives Matter.
The movement was born in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police shot a black teenager in Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement are identified by the queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has held the whole movement," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight constantly with many fronts.
Black Quer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees with: "Folayan indeed sustains black women, including many queer women."
However, he stressed that Ferrelli was not selected for his "self-defined" queer identity.
"He got the power," Folayan says.
"But there is no chance that he was on the front line. Black queer women live at the cutting point of many things, and they have a lot in the game.
"His energy will pass on from the white heel."
The news groups have left Ferguson long ago, but the Community and the police are still tense.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of parole left, and he was convicted of blocking the motorway in the protest.
His description of the social policy climate in his households is short and grim: "The fall."
Yet he continues to trust the blow that he learned outside Ferguson's streets three years ago:
"It is our duty to fight our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains."
Appropriate Likeness: The artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the Fridman Gallery in New York, the exhibition space has been hanged in the middle of the exhibition space – white, black and brown faces between which you can see a similar look.
These 30 works are portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth's prison, where he made his 35-year sentence, and Manning was convicted of pouring classified diplomats to the WikiLeaks website.
Dewey-Hagborgin The Becoming Rememblance exhibition was opened on 2.8.2017.
It has two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, IT and art in his work. Manning is a trans-versal and career-oriented dissident, whose prison judge Barack Obama was relieved of his term of office on the third day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzes Manning's DNA from its algorithm and created 30 portraits based on his gene data. They are sharp, although slightly theoretical stances on DNA transformation, complexity and interpretations of the causal consequences and identity.
Chelsea Manning, born in Bradley Edward, has openly told the women that he has been found to be a match since the break-in, which in 2013 was found guilty of 20 crimes, including the violation of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning sentenced to prison: a rake, black-and-white selfie, in which the troubled-like Manning sits in the car in the presence of the driver.
Dewey-Hagborg had behind him a very popular Stranger Visions project he carried out in 2012.
It's where he created portraits based on forensic data, and he got DNA from, for example, tobacco smokes and gums, and he created pictures of what the people in question could have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from the Paper Magazine magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case," Dewey-Hagborg told me a new exhibition at the press conference.
He couldn't go to Manning's house and he couldn't be shot in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked him if he wanted to make a DNA image of Manning.
The artist and his incarcerated musicians suddenly became correspondence mates, and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even worked together on a Suppressed Images seriesbook, which was pictured by Shoili Kanungo, which describes the future where the president would mitigate Chelsea's judgment and be able to look at the exhibition.
In fact, Obama shortened Manning's sentence only a few days after the publication of the comic book, which was a lucky coincidence after seven hard years in the national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened right now, when Donald Trump will go into his own war against data leaks and trans-trans-EU soldiers and will find new ways to strengthen those powerful explorers that he was actually supposed to relieve.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everybody has a purpose."
On the wall of the gallery, there is the statement of the artist, and under it Manning's great title, where the family name i is the point of the heart. In his opinion, the artist demands an end to the "automatic distribution to which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based".
The opposite wall has Manning's DNA sequence: a long line of letters C, G and A written on lead.
With this 200 letters – or nucleotide, such as the artist's scientific definition – a combination of Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
"I want my exhibition to help people understand that we are equal to our genetic heritage and that genetic data are very personal and open for interpretations," says Dewey-Hagborg. The exhibition also shows his Spurious Memory video from 2007.
"DNA tells countless stories, and there's 30 of them here."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: page from the Manning and Dewey-Hagborg comic book.
There's Manning's character coming out of jail like King Kong, with a megaphone in his hand.
"If they get you slowed down, they've won," it says.
"Don't ever make it easy."
"Teksti is the letter I received from Manning," says the artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive, I'm still getting cold colors."
Unlike described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen an exhibition. When Manning comes in, he was greeted by his own genetic data based faces as a crowd of protestors in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is deliberate, as everything else in this exhibition: for example, the Manning DNA sequence is written at lead height, which is the same as his height (157.5 cm).
"The cats used to be on the wall, but I wanted to bring them a lot of people feel," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to describe the mass movement created by Chelsea, which was also behind his release."
Professor at Northwest University and employee at Oxford University are being searched for murder as suspects.
Police report that they have launched a national search to find a professor at Northwest University and an employee at Oxford University suspected of being stabbed by a man in Chicago's luxury home.
It appears from the file of Cook County Court that arrest warrants were issued on Monday from Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Durunleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Durunleau, 26, died several times after he was stabbed.
According to the local bulletin published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27.7.2017.
Police in the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple scar wounds in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Durunleau was found dead at the scene, and he was investigated as a murder, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor at the Nortwester University of Microbiology and Immunology since 2007.
In its opinion, Mr K. Cubbage, Deputy Director for Social Relations at the University, said that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to Northwest University campaigns.
"This is a criminal case that the authorities are investigating, and the Northwest University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
The opinion sent by the University and Somerville College informant states that "we have been in contact with the police in Great Britain and we are ready to assist the US authorities in all possible ways."
The opinion also noted that Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would give up.
Anthony Guglimelite, the head of information at the Chicago Police Department, said that he strongly urged suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"Polices have an idea of where they are, and we constantly specify what we're looking for," Guglimeli said.
According to Guglimi, local, regional and national authorities will assist in the search for suspects.
He told me that the police had received a call from the host of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague indication that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the scene in the scene as terrible.
According to Guglimi, it is unclear whether the victim had been murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told me the security cameras discovered that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," says Guglimimi.
The Grand Plaza Steering Team published the following announcement to the residents: "It should be possible to investigate the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
He threatened to blow up Islamic bookstore and kill Muslims in London.
"I'm not an anti-muslimi, I'm a Catholic," the judge said to the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man got a conviction about his threats to blow up Islamic bookstore in London and kill all Muslims.
According to the Independent magazine, David Moffatt was convicted of, among other things, serious harassment.
According to the police, the Bookshop staff alerted them on May 23rd.
According to staff, the man had been "awry to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims."
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffat was captured when he called the police about the threat.
The threat was not related to book trade events.
The authorities noticed that the Moffat had been dressed in the same direction as the suspect in the bookstore, the police reporter said.
I'm not an anti-muslimi, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt told the police in interrogations.
As a penalty, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay 620 pounds, i.e. approximately EUR 690 and 85 pounds, i.e. approximately EUR 95.
According to Scotland Yard's reporter, a number of hate crimes are not reported.
"We will complete the WADA road map in the near future" – Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko of Russia
Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the measures under the WADA Road Map which can restore the RUSADA mandate of the Russian Anti-Dumping Commission.
"One of the measures under the road map has already been implemented, and RUSADA has been given the right to design and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Dumping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard," Muko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for the return of RUSADA's mandate.
According to the Mutko, it does not contain anything worrying about Russia.
"It's all been announced, and everything is done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympics Committee and WADA in the near future", Mutko added.
However, one of the points on the road map requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the results of the investigation by WADA, a Canadian lawyer, Richard McLaren, who investigates the alleged State's involvement in Russian sports doping.
In that regard, Mr Mutko said: "The investigation is being carried out because our anti-doping system has admitted to failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes, and we cannot admit what was not existing."
According to Mutkon, there were echoes of the opinion of Mr Smirnov, President of the independent public anti-doping committee in Russia.
Smirnov spoke to the Russian Smirnov on the same day that the Russian sports media said that there have been problems in the Russian anti-doping institutions. "We have said several times that there have been conflicting statements and provisions in this report.
We are not going to adopt the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015, when the size of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
After his visit, the director of WADA, Olivier Niggli, visited the RUSADA headquarters in Moscow in July.
A British organization sceptical about love innovation for Finns: There is no evidence of the health benefits of maternity packaging
The British organization doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
Among other things, BBC and Guardian reports that the Lullaby Trust organization fighting against hidden deaths prohibits the use of its own brochures in British divided maternity packages.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to Lellaby Trust, there is no evidence that maternity packaging reduces the risk of death.
The death of a baby means the sudden death of a baby.
Lullaby Trust is an expert at the British Health Authorities in the child’s safe sleep.
We no longer allow our official brochures to be packaged with them because it would allow us to understand that we recommend this product, the organization informed us.
Finland has one of the world's lowest child mortality readings, only two dead per thousand born.
According to Lillaby Trust, Finland's good reading is a result of many different reasons, such as the number of minor teen attacks.
The giving of a box for each family can be one factor.
But you can't say that for sure, Mr. Francine Bates, CEO of Lellaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and mitts.
Maternity pack is a Finnish invention and is given to all mothers in Finland for free for 80 years.
The package includes a variety of items such as baby clothes.
This year, there are 53 products in the package.
The package itself is a cardboard box to which the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all security standards.
Lellaby Trust, for his part, says that there is no security standard for balconies as a place to sleep.
According to Lullaby Trust, the packaging can be the best option for sleeping if there is no frame or surface bed available.
The organization recommends using the packaging for daytime only and to stop using it at the stage when the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets away from packaging and ensuring that they are not soaked or dirty.
Vikelä's frog ran away from a Japanese zoo again.
The Japanese zoo staff is looking for a deported turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at their speeds and already escaped in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from Shibukawa zoo in West Japan on Tuesday morning.
The security cameras revealed that the frog left the zoo through the Easter entrance.
It won't die right away because it eats grass around the zoo, but we're very worried about Yoshimi Yamane, working at the zoo, told us.
The 35-year-old frog is female, 55-pound long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the frog will be allowed to travel freely in the wise area.
The zoo has not received any sighting findings from the turtle.
The last carousel of my home happened the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking about 150 meters from the zoo.
I saw it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we can ever imagine.
These startups help your company avoid Uber errors
Amy Erlett wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees in his online shop start-up attempt, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured us that the surveys were anonymous, some of the employees were suspicious of them.
"The questions were simply not consistent or objective," says Erlett. As his hair care company Madison Reed focuses on the online shop. The company has 75 employees.
He decided to take care of outside aid.
The market has become increasingly new start-up companies in the Human Resources Administration, which help other companies to find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure employees' commitment, allow them to survey and target them to certain teams and population groups and provide their employees with anonymous reporting services and, in some cases, direct contact with the management board.
"My own health can be monitored by applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where does Fitbit stay?" asks the founder and CEO Jim Barnett. Glint offers companies analytical software to measure employees' commitment.
He says he's got a deeper view of his employees' thoughts and feelings.
The program can make rapid surveys and vote on certain teams, and it can also draw up a map of which you can see with one eye, where employees are less discontent and who have received the worst estimates of the leaders.
The companies have understood that they must follow the workplace culture so that they do not become the next Uberia. Around the transport business, the former employee has fallen since he wrote his blog about a culture in which workers are being persecuted and being punished for their problems.
For startups like Glint, such neglects are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global sector whose value, according to the Let's Talk Payments website, can reach over $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent in Denver's Colorado State is a startup that helps companies to detect and prevent inappropriate behaviour. An interest in the company grew earlier this year, when Uber's reputation experienced a crash.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla, for example.
It recently made a deal with Uber, too.
As Glint did, Convercent gives companies the opportunity to make customized surveys, collect answers confidentially in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, workers can make an anonymous statement of inappropriate behaviour by means of a text message.
And if you have reason to doubt the manager, the complaints go directly to the company's government.
"The public opinion has been set aside by the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts ethically, the consequences can become expensive even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start to boycott the company, and it can also lose workers and become suspensive.
Ruby Tuesday has over 25,000 employees at 500 offices. The company has used the Convercent over a year to ensure that workers are aware of the policies and procedures and can easily contact the headquarters.
The practice was that if the employee wanted to report the problem, he had to first find out the telephone number or an e-mail address that was able to make a notification to the head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a scary and unpleasant experience," says Ruby Tuesday's Legal Director James Vitrano. According to him, complaints made by employees were difficult to follow.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I have a more comprehensive and comprehensive view of the employee's reality," says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"We will also protect our shareholders from court proceedings in connection with employment relations."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employees' commitment more seriously after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of ethical action in the context of the Enron scandal.
It was only with social media that the companies understood that they could no longer prevent public investigation of their dirty goods.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came under the control of ethics," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service that is regularly charged.
It is a business model approved by the venture capitalists and an opportunity for both Glint and Convercent to be supported by venture capital investors.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million of funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised a total of $47 million in capital.
Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total amount of $60 million.
Investments are not a surprise given the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, workers expect more of their jobs.
In a competitive market such as a hidden pool, good wages and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are giving their time to a genuinely beneficial company.
"The employees are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened and that their work is rewarding", says Nina McQueen, CEO of LinkedIn, who is responsible for the remuneration and well-being of workers.
Investors will receive returns when companies succeed, and companies will succeed when employees commit themselves.
Third-party analytical tools promise to strengthen workers' commitment, so no wonder they are interested in investors.
According to the experts of the workplace culture, knowledge of the commitment of workers is important,
But it is useless if no action is taken on the basis of it.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be regarded as a sign of change.
And if the change does not come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the commitment of workers.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be ready to hold four thousand debates," says Russell Raath, CEO of the management consultant Kutter International, who has seen companies rely too much on just gathering information.
"If the company doesn't take action, the workers will start to wonder if they've been heard
and whether their opinions matter.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to the press, Madison Reed is currently conducting staff surveys monthly and able to address the problem on the same day as is reported in Glint.
After gathering feedback from workers who were frustrated with decision-making and the quality of communication, He was able to make changes to the teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees more and better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it to improve staff stability in the long term in an industry known as the high turnover of workers.
"If a company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees", Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no companies."
In Sweden, 20-year-old men are suspected of mimicing their naked female neighbor, reports TT.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come out of her home from the shower when she had noticed that she had a cell phone hanging off her head.
A woman said that a cell phone camera took a photo of the apartment.
A woman who was scared of the case had been running into another room to dress.
When a woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone was pulled up first, but soon after counting into the window again.
A 20-year-old man who's been filming has admitted that he's filmed a woman.
But he said that he only photographed a woman's face.
The video we recorded on the phone had been removed, and the police had failed to restore it as evidence.
In the hearings, the man has admitted his actions, but he has refused to commit a crime.
The man who was filming was justifiable to say that he loves his neighbor as "the crazy man".
According to the news office, a man is charged with the case.
Teachers call for more loopholes in the autumn negotiations
The wage development cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the difference should be narrowed, said OAJ President Olli Lukkainen on Thursday.
The temporary surgery of public sector holiday money underlines the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements that would in any way not involve holiday cash operations.
In the municipal sector, contracts only arise after the private sector's papers are signed and the increase percentages are clear.
A few predicts that, for example, OAJ's working terms have been agreed in January.
The percentage targets were not yet revealed by Lukanen.
It is also President of Juko, a public-skilled negotiating organisation.
Lukinen: Holiday surgery increases pay gap
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is reduced while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to the figure, the fixed-term holiday allowance cut is further reduced by the difference in earnings.
In Finland, how many pupils per teacher can be
OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as differences between the best and the weakest are growing all the time.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are diminishing, and differences between pupils and regions are constantly growing.
The Bruins player's day was extended when the NCAA reduced daily exercises to two together
It's almost 11:00 a.m., a group of UCLA football players have been left to talk about the campus on the other side of the new training venues.
Some of them have taken off their game shirts, and their backs are admiring the sweat after the first day of the training camp.
Time for many of them, this a few minutes of conversation is a midday break.
After three hours of exercises at university summer courses, players will return to the apartment to read final tests. Next morning they will meet from half seven to the Wasserman football centre.
"The roughs of the next three days for these guys," says Bruins Coach Jim Mora, a little before the Monday shift to Tuesday.
The university board of roofing reduced the number of daily exercises to two. The change was intended to reduce the number of players, but it has extended their days — at least until Friday, when the final tests were taken.
That's why the first three exercises of UCLA began in more than seven evenings. Even the full schedules of the players were difficult to find space.
This year, the Leiri started almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in the Westwood coaching period through Mora six, when the exercises are held at the same time as the summer courses.
The training is scheduled to take place 18 times before August 20th, when the actual preparation begins at the opening of the season: UCLA will meet in September at the Texas A&M University.
Mora says she supported the NCAA rule change, even though it made the players' schedules even more stringent.
"We're really killing them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work. They're great friends.
I think it'll make things easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes exercises after camp outside. It is not easy to take into account the direct view of the parking area next to the training grounds and the Luski Center, a high-level hotel that has already been bombarded with a protective net behind the goal pole on flying football.
Bruins players are scheduled to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are available outside.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The problem is that people can book a room from there to shoot exercises for the video. It is not an excessive concern.
The video from the exercises is paid quite a lot.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not gonna bother my head about it.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
Presidential elections will be held in Rwanda in Central Africa on Friday, whose winners will already be seen as clear.
Paul Kagame formally seeks for his third season, but in practice, he has had an impact on the country's leadership since 1994.
Then the rebel group RPF stopped the genocide organized by the extremes.
Kagame was commander of the RPF.
Kamame has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and limiting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused of, for example, the distortion of poverty statistics.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to make an effort, as the two-year constitutions of the Presidency were changed.
However, in Rwanda Kagame is also a truly respected leader.
In his day, Rwanda has made social reforms and has made international investments.
Kagame has also played a major role in combining the country of genocide.
Rwanda’s success has led many Africans to ask whether the liberal multiparty democracy is the right model for African countries.
However, Kagame too has promised his people more freedom after the country has been lifted up.
Now could be a good time to start.
Facebook fights false news by enhancing the inspection of facts
Facebook will send possible false news to more and more independent facts inspectors and present results under the original article. The largest social network in the world announced this on Thursday.
The company published on its website a statement that it will start using updated machine learning to identify false news. Possible false news is sent to the facts inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for the fact that it is one of the biggest false news distributors. Many feel that false news had an impact on the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The subject has come to a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed by false news before the May presidential election and by Germany preparing for the September elections, to support the plan to fine up social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate opinion published in Germany that the examination of facts would be tested in the United States, France, Netherlands and Germany.
People want to see which stories do not cross the walls of independent inspectors. They also want more background data to decide more clearly what they read and share, Facebook news feed product manager Sara Su wrote in the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing the Subject-related articles and will make other changes to its news feed in order to reduce false news.
The birth of a comic book: The story of a castle
The small town of Scotney in the Count of Kent is now known as Squeeze's music video, as well as Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of stormy history behind it, and now this charming place in Bewlin River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, an old-fashioned writer who has a moppi-haired record.
"It's great to be able to study the text written by a person who died over 300 years ago," says Rhodes.
"I know a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edardian era. Each story has imagined different artists, promising British cartoons: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, he was released from Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stores, whose inspiration sources were the British National Library's documents. The project was emotional.
"I moved on to tears in a letter to see a thumbprint. The letter had been written by a double agent who worked on the Jacobs in the 1700s," says Rhodes.
"It was her fingerprints!
And the letters smell from the smoke, because at that time the fire was used as a lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell will make the reader feel like he's on the ground himself.
I love archives!"
The writer in old papers was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council, which seemed too good to be true, and he admitted that he could not be in the castle without delay longer than he had hoped.
He spent days studying the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rareities, such as the walls hung hyena heads and hundreds of bottled bottles.
He toured the old castle with ruins and farms and discussed with hunters, gardeners, and sometimes even book artists.
I'd like to have her say, "Big whiskey and start writing."
The closer history of Scotney is quite unknown, since the city was fully transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the last heir, Elizabeth Hussein, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation staff was only about to start a archive visit. Rhodes describes that archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: by taking all the extras to the attic.
In the archives there were journals, letters from the English Empire, and maps of who owned something. "You could imagine that the magic is boring," Rhodes says. "This is where the families fought for even one barge.
It occurred to me that we should not be."
Some of the stories of the book are going from castle to history, like The Labourer. It tells of a man who will soon be joining the English peasant captain in 1381.
"The Knightly Familys of Kent and Sussex book states that there was a riot in the castle in 1380", says Rhodes.
"As England's peasant captain, it started in the same area, and it came to mind that rebellion can start from the riot.
Perhaps these events are interrelated?"
The other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle, such as The Priest, the story of the priest, whom Darrell’s family hid seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler again tells of the story of the smuggler Arthur Darrell in the 17th century. He is said to have faked his own funeral by filling the coffin with stone (it was found years later when his grave was opened).
Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The men of the family seem to have been quite a stranger, and they were constantly in debt and bought things they couldn't afford.
The men of Darrell's family solved their debt problems by getting married to the old women of the wealthy, seeing them as handsome friends who knew about a mild heir."
Now, Rhodes is applying for new writing experience.
He spent two weeks writing a comic book about Lifetime in Finland, a cure in the early 20th century, which is left with only a refurbished plot.
Scotney Castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave there," he says.
"I wouldn't have wanted to come back to this devil's ark yet."
Between Russia and the worst then the Cold War
The military union between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commenting Ms Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I believe that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Mr Stoltenberg said at the CNN interview.
After the Cold War ended, we hoped that we would be able to work closely with Russia.
However, especially after the illegal accession of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability of Russia in the eastern Ukraine have deteriorated significantly due to NATO's relationship with Russia.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to acting so as not to tighten its tensions.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid aggravating the situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump was able to identify the U.S. between Russia and the United States at even a dangerous bad level.
Trump urged us to thank the countries for their bad-looking Congress, which adopted the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko will stop the replay against Anthony Joshua
The long-term heavyweight world champion Vladimir Klitshko will end his career.
The Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who hit gold at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, took 69 times to win matches 64.
He held various MM titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost his career in two last fights.
Tyson Fury hit him in November 2015.
In April this year Klitshko met with Wembley's stadium Anthony Joshua and lost after a wild fight in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet again in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko did not find any motivation in the fight.
I deliberately used myself to make a few weeks' decision to get enough distance from the Wembley game, Klitshko told me when he informed me.
As an amateur and occupational predator, I have achieved everything I dreamt of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined I had such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I'm very grateful for that.
Look at Klitshko's reasons for making his decision on the video.
Klitshko's manager Bernd Bönte reported on the announcement that the termination decision was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating with American actor Hayden Panttier since 2009.
Paris has one child, daughter Kaya born in 2014.
Klitshko's big brother Vitali is also the former heavyweight champion of the world.
In 2008-12 the brothers managed the MM titles of different associations at the same time.
The Finnish weatherman picks up the conditions: "Vie of files"
Minna Nikkenen has suffered the conditions during the summer's outpost period.
Minna Nikes has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and cold have taken a woman from her file.
Even in London's World Cups, there are unstable conditions.
Minna Nikonen speaks weather.
The circumstances have been against Minna Nikos this summer.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was imaginable that I didn't even get to move small walls properly, so Nikonen said after the Innsbruck race.
I've been competing and practicing here in the way how many times I've never felt in this place like a different wind, Nikonen told me in Paavo Nurm Games.
During this period, the standardization of the jump has been very difficult when the exercises have had such unstable winds, Nikonen said in Kaleva's competitions.
The weather was on Thursday in London, too.
It's kind of challenging to get the technology together, whether it's cold stuff or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken away from the file.
It doesn't make sense to spend energy under bad circumstances.
He got to the World Cup 455.
It's been 445 out there.
It's not the same thing for everyone in London.
We've got to have a toast and wait for a better wind.
The aim is to cross 460 on Friday.
Why don't you change your training abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got a jump in the pile and I got the tech standardized.
I guess I should have done the same now.
Normally, the hall has been trained, now the hall has been caught.
What would it be like to race?
25 degrees warm.
It's a little windy, as long as it's standard.
An experienced ex-husband was boring politicians at Yle: "We don't have any room for division now or for many years"
Despite the positive economic climate, the Government of Juha Sipilä has to stay in six and be careful of the government's budget's bloating debt money, warn the Ministry of Finance of Erkki Virtanen, who has prepared budgets for decades.
He says there's no room for division.
Yle interviewed Virta on Wednesday, 2015.
The construction of the state's budget next year is just beginning.
Recently, the proposals put forward by policy-makers, including the increase in guarantee pension, the calculation of car tax and the support of electric bicycles, are considered by Virtanen as electoral speeches.
They mainly say that the elections are beginning to be close because, when 10% of the state budget is financed with additional debt, we have no room for distribution now or for several years.
I even think it's a fraud to talk about the split money when it comes to debt, Virtanen told Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debts were due to children.
Virtas has a long experience in preparing the state's budgets: he started in 1978 as a budgetary secretary in the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Head of Budgets and Head of Budgets.
Before he retired, he was the head of office of the Ministry of Employment and the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In his interview, Virtanen pointed out that the economic growth of the 3% now projected is likely to be temporary.
Everyone estimates that this is a plague that is already going to be under-visual next year, and Finland expects a 1% increase in one percent for tens of years.
Washington changes the rules on permanent residence permits
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules of the permanent residence permit, Green Card, will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, to tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
New rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The draft law is due to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars by changing taxpayers' money in the way that permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new search process will benefit applicants who know English and can support themselves and have useful skills in our economy", Trump stated according to the media.
The wife of the Danish queen doesn't want to be buried in the same place as the queen.
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareta.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margreeta were filmed in April.
The Danish queen Margareta, 77, and her spouse Prince Henriki, 83, is not buried next to her, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the ruling couples in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The King's room today has announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Roskille judgment church, and the court notes in his announcement on Thursday.
According to the BT magazine, this is due to the prince's dissatisfaction in his role as King's family.
There is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his roles and his titles in the Danish monarchy, the Head of Communications of the Court, Lene Belleby, commented in the magazine.
The prince’s decision not to bury him next to the queen is a natural consequence of his not being treated as equal to his mate.
According to Hovi, the queen has long been aware of the desire to bury her spouse and to understand the decision.
A terrible moment on the road: The car was on the highway
Tom had a sidekick and two little children on the ride.
They were not injured in an accident, but they do not receive money from the insurance if the other party is not targeted.
The accident happened at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Archive photo of Kehä III construction site.
Vantalainen Tommi tells us his family survived a miracle on Tuesday at the store in a car accident.
Tommi, two small children from his co-op Riina and the couple drove on the highway to Keimolaport in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
The body III from the connection to the Hämeenlinnalälä was speeding up the white car, which was to drive to the village of the family car, Tommi says.
If it wasn't for the ambush, the car would've been hit by Tom.
I brake and turned the car at the same time, and it went out of hand, Tommi tells me.
The family car hit the rails at high speed.
The parents and the two little children in the back seat were not injured.
The second child is a little less than three years old, the second one is less than one year old.
It must have been pretty lucky when nothing happened to us.
No one was driving by us, even though there was a lively traffic in the place.
The accident happened about 5.20 p.m.
According to Tom, no one stopped at their place, and the family called the emergency center.
They got out of the car by themselves.
The ambulance and rescue staff came in, and the family's condition was reviewed.
The car went to the ransom.
Tommi tells her and her fostering little income, and they got help from buying a car a few years ago.
If it's not for the other car, the family doesn't say Tom's gonna get the money out of the insurance.
Therefore, the family looks forward to seeing the findings of the car, which is why the family drove to the rails.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take the kids away and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw the car was white, old-fashioned.
It was probably from the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 21st century.
He thought the start of the car registration number was SIG.
If we don't catch the guilty person, I don't know how we're doing financially, we're going to have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that what has happened or something they know has been in contact with the police.
The police station in Eastern Uusimaa and the rescue facility in Central Uusimaa confirm that they have had an accident on Tuesday night at the scene.
Title and case corrected at 21.15: Unlike the case originally told, another car, according to Tom, did not come from the reception band, was to drive from the accelerator to the side of the family car.
The performance led by Lotta Jääppinen deals with human relationships with the sense of humor - the self-reflect will be seen at the What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
The Lota Jäppinen from Kouvola will bring his premiere to the What? Theatre.
The self-discretioner is the musical theatre performance, in the face of past human relationships and inefficiencies.
According to Director Lotta Jäppinen, it still feels like it's gonna be a good idea.
The subject is dealt with by the use of humor.
I don't think you're going to have to spend any time with the boring feelings, he says.
According to Jeppin, a tour of summer theatre performance has been carried out with a long-range budget and with a large, young heart.
The name of the presentation asks us to consider what a person reveals himself when he comes to know another person.
Do you think he's going to play a role or is he going to open another coat?
Uncomplicated presentation confuses fact and fiction
The clue has both been controlled and dramatized.
He's also responsible for the lights.
The presentation is made up of the texts of the working group and does not have a plan.
The director believes that although the presentation draws away from the thoughts of young people, it speaks of all ages.
The key point is that the self-reporter does not speak directly about his or his personal relations with the working group.
Fact and fiction get mixed up.
I'm sure my values will pass on from the show.
I do not think that relationships with human beings would be bad, but I do not think that a relationship with human beings, especially a relationship, would be a good condition.
Many learn from their divorced parents
Jääppinen believes that the self-reporter draws a timely picture of young adults living in Finland in a 100-year-old.
He said that many have learned much from their relationships with their parents, many of whom have been separated.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The presentation is presented by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes the suitor Ella Snellman.
The musical reconciliation is Jeppenen and Rokan.
Love for the theater set fire to Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26 from Kouvola, is studying as director of the theatre expression at the Turku University of Applied Sciences.
It's two years behind, and it's two years ahead of me.
The enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the course of the Kouvolan years.
The teacher of the music classes has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has been performing, among other things, at the University of Helsinki and most recently at the City Theatre in Turku.
Control has become more and more interested.
The self-reporter got his first night in Helsinki last week at Narr's stage.
For about 45 minutes, the presentation has also seen in the future, at least in Jäppinen's study city, Turku.
Self-reflecting Kouvola at what?-the theater at 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. at 14 and 19 p.m.
For a year, a Finnish Olympic winner recovered from a rough motocrossing accident.
Few athletes in Finland have similar unstopable natural power as Janne Lahtila.
At the age of the moon, hundreds of days went around the world a year for a period of 20 years, chasing his dream from the Olympic King.
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtila's movement continued.
He was not only a tireless intern, he was also an experimentor for new species.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on earth that a chemist would not have tried at least once.
It's inspired to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtila tells us.
Finally, one hobby was to stop the Gulf completely.
In 2014, Lahtila was in a motorcross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I wasn't working anywhere.
I've been licking wounds in my house for a year, Lahtila says.
The gift was bad luck.
He also admits that age could have been a part of the ruin.
You know, driving a bike might sound like a wild one.
But I didn't get the limits.
It's just so hard as a species that you don't get too much of a 40-year-old to do!
After the accident, Lahtila was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
The behind was a long rudder as head coach for the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtila started washing immediately after his career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do much, Lahtila tells me.
Even during the training period Lahtila often challenged its shields in the slope and in the physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that my own thoughts did not seem reasonable.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be there.
I'm actually enjoying it because I was actually able to be once.
The forced break inspired Lahtila to become Finland’s chief coach.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'd be burned out.
It's easier to find places in the crown that's been cut off than real ones!
If it wasn't for an accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtila started the Finnish freestyle team as coach about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby than the rushers.
I changed the motocross to frisbeegolphine!
I thought it left the shovel right away.
I was in my worst position seven hours a day throwing.
Although Lahtila has always been a super-intelligent coach, she does not require her trainees to be similar to her.
I'm not gonna make everyone do the same.
In our culture, there is room to be one of our own and ways to be the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been according to it, Lahtila says.
Sex robots are coming and we need to be worried about.
It is here: a report on technological progress in the field of sex robotics – just after it has started to feel that 2017 can no longer get weirder.
Yes, I am.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics, FRR, recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
"We must start to take seriously the dissemination of sex robots," says the founding member of the Foundation and professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Noel Sharpy Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingertips.
"Sexerobots are being flattered, but they are already sold quite a bit, and we will see them more and more," Sharp said the report at the press conference.
The sex traps have developed from excavating dolls with warm silk skin and artificial intelligence to resemble human behavior.
The user can also adapt the robot to his own preferences from the colour of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and colour of the fingertips.
More worrying is that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford's women look like advanced freedom fighters.
Sex traps have developed into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the character features of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, even if it is shy.
The Roxxxy Gold robots of True Companion have pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventure-like and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts to user personality as fully as possible", the company's website is advertised.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has a variety of moods:
It could be, like, tired, in the mood or in the wind.
There are many worrying features in the dissemination of sex robots, which replace genuine human relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and the direct rape fantasy when the user approaches, for example, the robot that is being programmed as shy and opposed.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot to the vibrator on its website:
"Women have a vibrator, why shouldn't men have a sex robot?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetis or a new kind of sex game.
Their generalisation and development is about something darker and deeper in our culture: the decline in gender equality towards sexual relations, where subjugation is one of the options among others.
Of course, most men are not getting sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report tells us about their growing popularity.
But Marginal phenomena tell us a lot about the spirit of time.
And many begin to behave strangely or offensively only when the market gives it permission.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have started to become more widespread at the same time as women's rights are threatened across the world and the White House is a president who has been praising women.
In the TV series The Handmad's Tale (Orjattaresi) is not the most worrying image language, such as pictures of hanged bodies and out of the mined eyes. The most alarming thing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Sex robots are tried to do as much as real women (porno-star proportions) as technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and move as well as possible imitate human movements.
But their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot can't leave the relationship or the situation.
They do not have their own will or history — a fantasy of independence or complete surrender.
They are pleasant servants.
A slave.
Police suspect: two acts of terror were planned in Australia, led by Isisi Chief
Isisi's leader led a group of Australian men suspected of taking a bomb to the Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leaders had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
Suspects say the bomb was to be taken to the plane on July 15th, but the company was interrupted before the security inspection.
The police won't be more specific about why the company was interrupted.
Another terrorist plan for suspects was to build a toxic-colored gas-separate device and to bring the device into a public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
The Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were caught in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews continue.
Trump's good side?
Make Mitt Romney look like a common sense.
In the Trump period, it has been repeated to get bored that the strong challenge of voters has also broken down families at everyday level.
With Christmas and Thanksgiving, the American newspapers’ counselling panels were guided by the way Trump and the relatives who voted for it.
We all want to blow up our information column.
The ability of Trump to unite families has been reduced.
I'm telling you this because my cousin was visiting me this week in New York, and he's a left-wing poet in Chicago who's been close to the Republican family for a long time.
He reminded us that a common enemy could have a powerful combined effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all my cousins are familiar – including Republicans, a sister with whom she has challenged politics for decades – are suddenly and suddenly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but more generally, there are significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new power, but the distortive effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalisation", we talk about the scary possibility that one day we won't be able to beat his tricks.
In the long run, there is even more terrible chance that Trump will normalize the real extreme Republicans that suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
I think of Mitt Romney's controlled version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (and his tax return, at least, we've seen).
When Trump's season is over, the next President of the Republican presidency needs only to be clear, and it feels like an immediate improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our kid to Central Park's carousel, which is the biggest carousel in New York Park, and the best thing in New York is three dollars without caffeine.
The horses in Karusell are huge, in the middle — loose clowns and animals looking behind the terror — and the screaming music behind it is strangely fascinating.
Many of the features of New York are disappointing over time: the views of high buildings begin to get bored, the city silhouette becomes too familiar and the reality of the city is not in line with dreams.
Not yet, after 35 years, I have come all the way over that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cabin, but a major traffic circle in northern London. However, Ye Olde Swiss Cotttage is a Swiss spirit pub, but it is not calculated.
The carousel of the central park, however, is still a strange magical experience — even to the extent that two women, two years old, one 11 years old, and two women of forty, enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the carousel full points if someone had asked for my evaluation, but luckily no one came to ask.
Instead, I was asked this week at the store to assess my "payment test" with a scale of five stars before putting my credit card on a read-in device.
The same thing at the cafe in my neighborhood, but there's also an opportunity for me to combine an estimated 15% service allowance when I go to the coffee counter myself.
This slows down the daily interaction and pressures the customer servant to put his person in a game where it is not needed.
The seller of the regular bike smiled at me when I was tired of giving my credit card to the operating experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inter.
FC Inter has today released the mission of the Shefki Kuq Society mission coaching team.
The coaching responsibility is to take Fabrizio Piccare, who had previously served as an assistant coach.
Other training teams will continue to take up their current tasks.
Italian Piccareta has previously served as an assistant coach in Sunderland, England, for example.
In January, 51-year-old Piccare has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Mr Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the FC Inter Board, is sorry for what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the management of the company, and no other alternative was now available, Håkans commented on the company’s communication.
The Piccareta agreement is valid until the end of the period.
He is in charge of tomorrow's home match against HIFK with the other training group.
According to the information from the Night Sanomas, the team's been dying on Thursdays.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday that Piccareta and John Allen were moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta were a strong match against the PS Kem last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth picture in the '80s, would you recognize a serious violin student?
The Viulutist Linda Lampenius published a youth picture on Instagram.
A number of puzzles have been added to the picture, making it possible to conclude that the musician is a 16-year-old student of Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders a serious young woman looking at the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he's going to text me.
If the picture doesn't show, you can look at it.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about bitter topics.
A fair year ago, he published a couple of pictures of himself in Instagram.
In the second picture he is seen 20 years ago, the second one he poses now, as mother of two children.
In his illustration, Lampenius meditates on his own growth as a person and refers to eating disorders that he suffered younger than he did.
Twenty years ago, and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned how to love myself and how I look, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added in English abdominals life, eating disorder, uncertain, self-esteem, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, ageing is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating business in the past few years.
He was already at the hospital when he was 14.
A little later, he also became ill with his bulimia, which eventually came out only in 2006.
The improvement began to slow down.
In addition to therapy and peering, Lampenius helped another love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to the hospital because of chest pains.
This is the second time that Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital.
Last year he received hospital care for the cuts on his wrists, which, according to the prison authorities, he got lost in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder by the defendants' complaints about the original murder penalty.
He killed Steenkamp as early hours of friends in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night-old intruder who was hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have stated that they intend to appeal again because they consider the six-year sentence of Pistorius to be too mild.
The Kingdom Prosecutor intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal will possibly be dealt with already this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the judgment of Pistorius may extend for 15 years.
Death penalty is not available in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians who were illegally encamped were arrested in Greece, reported the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs according to the bTV channel.
The police arrested a group of encamped people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1st. There were two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation will continue.
According to TV channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that he had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the free rules for the camp areas and already give substantial fines to all who are camped outside of the areas reserved for purpose.
The checks will continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced that the right to impose a fine.

Red meat, milk products and chocolates may alleviate the symptoms of an inflamed bowel
Red meat and chocolate may sound like the nightmares of the digestive system.
However, the recent study claims the opposite: diet containing a high amount of meat protein and dairy products may facilitate the intestinal syndrome.
Elevated bowel syndrome is an unhealed disease of about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in Britain. It causes abdominal cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan contained in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen the tolerance of the bowel.
According to the head of the study, Marco Colonna, immune cells guard the intestine and ensure that no harmful microbes are found in the body.
Cells that cause inflammation are balanced by cells that strengthen the tolerance that protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the infection, the result may be an increased intestinal syndrome.
Studies have shown that immune cells that can be tolerated are in mice with a specific bacteria in the gut.
This bacteria needs tryptophan so the immune cells can start to appear. Tryptophan is one of the protein building materials.
"We found a connection between the development of Lactobacillus reuterus and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus router is part of the normal intestinal microbim," says Professor Colonna.
"The more the mouse's diet had tryptophan, the more they had these immune cells."
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri and a high-tryptophan diet may strengthen the tolerance of the intestine and reduce the susceptibility to infection.
In examining the tolerance of immune cells, Professor Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that, although one mouse group had these cells, they were not the same mice that were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to mouse intestinal antibiotics, i.e. the gastrointestinal tract of normal bacteria, fungi and viruses in the community.
When the DNA of mice was studied, six bacteria were observed in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactoblastus reuterus bacteria were given to mice that grew in a sterile environment that did not have intestinal microbims and who did not develop immune cells, immune cells began to develop.
The researchers wanted to find out how the bacteria affected the immune system, and they raised Lactobacillus rheutters in fluid and transferred small amounts of liquid – without bacteria – to the immune cells isolated from mice.
Immunocytes developed intolerant cells.
When the active ingredient was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3 milkic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice, the number of cells that can be tolerated rose by about 50%.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerance as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuters in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not yet known whether the Tryptophan by-products from the Lactobacillus reutere cells can develop in humans the same way as in mice. However, genetic errors associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with an elevated intestinal syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells, because they regulate infection on the intestines," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"The high tryptophan level combined with Lactobacillus reutterer bacteria may contribute to their increased frequency."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got into his lines of "genius" after signing an agreement with Nemanja Mati
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got his lines of "nero" after signing an agreement with Nemanja Mati. The midfield player debytoises Manchester United's lines in the match against Samporia on Wednesday night.
In a match before the UEFA Super Cup tournament match against Real Madrid on Tuesday, Matic started with a 2-1 victory in Dublin, in the last round of the United States. He was impressed by the defending middle field player Paul Pogban and Andreas Pereira.
But Mati was not in the best condition yet, because she was not involved in the Asian tour of blue shirts before the beginning of the season. She did only 45 minutes in the field – according to Mourinho, there must be a change before the beginning of the electoral season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking make him a genius – he has natural football thinking ability," says Mourinho.
"We'll help him be ready rather than ready later."
In addition to Mati, the newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were about to start the game at the Aviva stadium when Mourinho began to slice his opening meeting for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more players, even though the Society has already done "sustainable work" by acquiring three of his four priority players.
Three out of four – we must thank the company for that," he added.
"I'm happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
The volleyballs bullied Germany for a couple of days.
Finland's women's volleyball team lost their fourth match in the World Cup to Germany 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany's routine playing is high.
Their fair play was in every sector, Finnish head coach Tapio Kangasniemi reported on the paper.
In the first two instalments, Finland held its opponent in the pit, but in the third one Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany is leading the block.
When we were patient and, in certain places, aggressive enough, they were able to play with them, Kangasniemi said.
The most effective Finland had collected 14 points of Piia Korhonen.
Three out of four matches Finland will meet Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: The Great jury has already sent challenges in connection with Trump Jr's Russia meeting
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges regarding the meeting of Donald Trump Jr and Russian lawyers Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The large jury, called by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, has already sent challenges regarding the meeting of Donald Trump Jr and Russian lawyers known as the Kreml links, Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The news office Reuters tells us about this issue, which at the same time confirms the invitation of Wall Street Journal to the gathering of the great jury previously revealed on Thursday.
According to Reuters, the large jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting of Veselnitskaya, known as the Trump Jr and Kreml links, which was held in the middle of the US presidential elections in June 2016.
There were also Donald Trump Sr's campaign leader Paul Manafort and his son, current White House advisor Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has called together a great jury in Washington, means that Russia's investigation will be strengthened.
The source adds that Mueller wanted help from a large jury in an investigation that sought to find out Russia's involvement in the US presidential elections and whether Trump's campaign or his immediate cooperation with Russia was done.
The great jury expands Mueller’s rights to collect evidence, sends challenges, and forces people to testify on a voluntary basis.
There are a large group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The Grand jury will weigh evidence that has been investigated by the prosecutor and decide whether the prosecution should be brought into question.
The British inventor microchiped himself to get home and to his car with a hand-cuffing.
The British inventor is the first person in the whole country to microfilm himself so that he can open his home outside door, get into his office and launch his car with a bow of his hand.
Microchip is 33-year-old between Steven Northam's thumb and front finger, and now he offers service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam BioTeq's technology.
Northam cooperates with a consultant at the Royal Hampshire Hospital Hospital in Winchester, France, Geoff Watson, in order to meet the medical requirements of the microchip installation.
The microchip uses a technique similar to that used by cats and dogs in microchips, and it only takes 30 seconds to install it.
Northam’s attempt also makes the locks of houses and cars compatible with the microchip. One lock handling costs 300 pounds.
Northam is married, and he has one child, and he has placed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he drops his hand on the steering wheel.
Your white house show cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's last decision to fly a marine helicopter to the southern lawn of the White House was to pay the taxpayers $24,000 to receive the TIMME magazine from military documents.
A green-white Sikorsky VH-3D Helicopter uses the name Marine One when the President is on his ride. It was a bet at the event in the White House on 17 July 2017 in which American building programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a number of White House officials visited products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, the samples included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississip.
The White House Military Office had requested the helicopter to be present only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn stage for a "exceptional" event, which is reflected in the documents of the HMX-1 Helicoptern.
"I just wanted to make sure that you are aware of this, because this is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 unit commander wrote on the e-mail to his superior, who is the Deputy Commander of the Navy Air Force.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn at 7 p.m. in the morning, and the event would begin at three afternoons. Helicopter would leave the site only after the grass field was cleared between six and nine tonight.
The message also mentioned that if helicopters were to be delayed from the White House, another crew would be required due to restrictions on service times.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security staff were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
The documents received by TIMME magazine will not find out if we finally needed another crew.
The United States Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 was asking about breaking the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were told not to break," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," replied the Deputy Commander.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political shades.
At that time, the president spoke in favour of a health reform and a more loose state regulation that had been working on the Senate.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their journeys,
but their use only for photos is unusual.
Trump's actions in February, when Air Force One rolled behind the president's campaign event in Melbourne, Florida State. Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor's presidential plane on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, where products made from American materials by American workers from all 50 states were presented," said White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 unit crew regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train the President in the southern grassfield to bring him to the White House with a centimetres accuracy.
When Trump was at the G-20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 training calculations for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of the crew’s monthly training quota.
The helicopters of the unit were also flying 11 hours that day in non-presidential support positions.
According to the White House, the event did not cost taxpayers other costs.
Sikorsky's reporter told me that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter presentation in the southern lawn field of the White House.
HMX-1 has no record of flights related to the duties of the President, and the exact assessment of the costs of the event is difficult.
According to an hourly remuneration from the Ministry of Defence, the compensation level for VH-3D-helicopter is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to the documents of the HMX-1 unit, flights from Quantico to the White House from the State of Virginia and returned to the entire hour.
According to the White House, helicopter operating costs are clearly lower.
"Development of costs for taxpayers according to level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The necessary level of compensation shall include the costs of staff, maintenance and many other so-called 'supervised' expenditure, which shall be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the R & D study company’s 2015 report, compensation levels do not include personnel costs but take account of fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spider defended the use of helicopters in the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spider said.
"I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut is very proud of the fact that they are involved in ensuring national security and thereby employing hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of helicopters and other defence equipment that many Americans have worked hard on.
It's perfectly appropriate to bring it up."
It's not certain if Trump went to the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat on the driver's seat.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky boat.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President. "I have three."
The lightning hit the Vasaan track. The trains will be replaced by buses.
The passenger train between the wall and the Vasa is in a different way due to technical flaws, informs the Railway Control Centre.
The trains are so far replaced by buses.
The failure of the traffic control system caused a thunderstorm.
The railway centre had not yet an estimate of the length of the repairs in the morning.
The State Prosecutor of Venezuela calls for the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country
The State Prosecutor of Venezuela has applied for a court ruling which would prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
Nicolas Maduro, President of Venezuela, has announced that the representatives elected in the vote last Sunday are to be appointed on Friday.
In the contested vote, the country was elected by a representative who could, among other things, change the Constitution of the country.
According to Advocate General Luisa Ortega, the prevention decision has been requested for election polls.
Ortega has also started the election poll on the vote.
He appointed two judges after the British company that organised the representation vote said that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters notified by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of real voters.
Only the allies of Maduro were on the terms of the representative body, and the chosen 545 representatives have the son and wife of Maduro, among other things.
In addition to changing the Constitution, representatives can break up the opposition-led Congress and change the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
The actions of Maduro have been widely condemned.
The opposition considers the drafting of the Constitution as a means of strengthening its position.
The United States has made sanctions to Maduro and called it a dictator.
In turn, the European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they do not recognise the new representatives.
Maduro claims that the new representation is a solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, restlessness has been going on for months.
They have wounded numerous people, and more than 100 people have died.
Venezuela fell into a financial crisis after the price of oil fell.
Now many people can't afford food or medicines.
The opposition is also expected to show the opinion on Friday, when the new representative body is to begin.
Russian man, given by Finland, was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
The Minneapolis Court of Justice in the United States sentenced the 41 - year - old Maxim Senah to four years in prison for a global computer attack.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 following the US demand.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was returning home.
In February 2016, Finland submitted Senah to the US judicial authorities despite the opposition of the Russians, reports AFP.
He was found guilty of computer fraud in March this year, which had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah was in prison for 46 months.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after the execution of the prison sentence.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had a hard-hitting motive for Finland after the arrest and said that the man should not be handed over to the United States.
In the opinion of Finland and the United States, it was argued that the arrest was made in Finland without Russia knowing it in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus used to fish user names and passwords.
The Firmers then used the data by continuing to direct internet traffic, which made clicks and distributed spam.
According to the Director of the Ministry of Justice, the case shows that the United States is also able to hunt other cyber criminals.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco told us in the press.

Kari Kola implements an exceptional light art work in Paris
Kari Kola, a lighting artist in Joensuu (in Kuav), implements an exceptional work of light for the first light day of the Light set by the United Nations in Paris next year on 16 May.
Kola's making a photo art project in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the book are light and darkness, day and night, sun and moon.
In the book, Unesco headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe monument are lit.
In my book, I want to highlight not only the light but also the darkness.
Today, the light pollution of the millions of cities is a major problem that affects all our well-being.
With the help of my art, I can bring things that I have learned to be concretely visible, says the artist Kari Kola of his work.
I am very impressed to be part of the first international light day and bring the art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was present at the opening of the Light Year in 2015, when she would celebrate the celebration of the headquarters of Unesco.
I feel very privileged to re-establish my art at the Unesco headquarters, Kari Kola tells me.
The work may still expand significantly.
We'll inform you about this later in the coming autumn, Kola will continue.
The aim of the International Light Day is to highlight the importance of light for mankind and raise people's awareness of the areas of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Light Day will be celebrated at the UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on 16 May.
Two men fight at the mall in Espoo
Two men were born in Espoo at the shopping center of the Great Omena parking lot on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute was started when the other party accidentally drove into a prohibited direction.
There was an oral dispute between drivers.
A driver who was driving in a prohibited direction would fool the driver of another car, which led to this car moving into a hitter's car.
After this, he was still hit by a hit-and-run car in the machine.
The man has admitted in the preliminary debate that he has caused the damage and that he has wronged.
Timo Soin wrote on the question mark, "There was a flood after that"
On Thursday, Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (except for) published a blog article entitled The question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences.
In my day, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven MPs as a government party.
Then came the flood, now it all floats, sori writes.
The text of Soin contains references to France in the 17th century.
King Ludvig XV, or his lover Madame de Pompadour, is known to have used a water spill comparison.
Depending on the interpretation, history's books, there have been a series of attacks on "a flood after us" or "a flood after me".
According to the UN, Afghanistan's democracy depends on the political role of women
The elections will only be representative if they can vote on all members of society, including women, said the UN Head of Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
The interim leader of the UN Assistance Mission, Nicholas Haysom, stated that hundreds of women, three women and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women on the terms of county council elections.
"The role of women cannot be emphasised too much," Haysom said in her opinion on Wednesday.
The elections can be genuinely representative and credible only if women participate fully in them and involve them in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan Government Council and Presidential elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
Taliban has made threats to the elections at the same time as international troops are moving to an advisory role.
This year's elections will be the first time that power moves peacefully from democratically elected government to other government.
Haysom said that women's contribution to strengthening democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan independent electorate, 1.2 million of the 3,6 million registered voters are women.

The flooding of certain tourists to the culture of the region
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly focused on the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister for Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: only a few hours are in place and the sightings of the large groups are rushed through.
Venice has been trapped in busy day trips to urban tourists.
The narrow streets are difficult to move, and the fine walls are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice will no longer be able to get together.
They have been forced to move further from a historic center while hotels have been replaced.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about tourism problems in Venice.
Public authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the present phenomenon low quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, the time shall be given for two or three hours.
You will follow the ticket guide to Piazzale Romasta Rialton Bridge and St Markus Tower, and turn back, the Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini describes the tourism that is and cause problems.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the site, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the city's identity.
The Square of St Mark is also one of the most popular tourist destinations of the historic center of Venice.
The St. Mark's Church is located on the side of the Tori.
The local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
At the historic center of Venice, 50 000 locals live.
In 1951 the population was about 175 000.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Russians expressed their view on mass tourism.
They say that tourism has undermined their quality of life, destroys the environment, and drives the inhabitants away.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years' time there will be no tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who has been in the process of demonstration.
The equation is difficult because ships bring the income they desperately need in Venice and create the need for a number of jobs in different areas.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, a solution has been envisaged for cruisers to go further from the historic centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, is convinced that the situation would certainly change if the administrative district of Venice, where Venice is located, would have more power to decide on its own matters if not full autonomy.
Approximately 20-30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
On the freeway, bad carnage of miles
On the north road between Kuopio and Siilijärvi, the track has had miles of congestion at the time of the return from work on Thursday afternoon.
The area is covered by a motorway coating, which slows traffic, says Savo Sanomat.
In the case of roads, there is an hourly limit of 50 km rather than an hourly speed of 120 km.
Even in the 50 - mile - limit zone, traffic had moved in the Thursday afternoon, however, practically at a walking pace.
On Thursday afternoon, the roads were on the side of Lake Sililärv in the presence of the Revelation Point, or of the golden guerrilla.
I'm getting along well without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the screams of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published great images of herself, including in Grand Canyon's landscapes.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish-northian, has become a popular athlete in Norway, not least because he violated the 26-year-old Norwegian record in a 400-metre run through the course of the course of 51.81.
A month later, he healed the 400-metre fence drink at the Norwegian record on 55.38.
Iuel, who uses hard social media, soon after his record, discovered that fame and publicity have its shadows.
Apparently, men from all over the world began sending pictures of their sex organs to Iuel in the hope that a young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel had to shut down his Snapchat account from outside.
I got a lot of broken pictures from unknown people, so I had to turn my account into a private one, Iuel told the VG magazine.
Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of pictures he received in the VG interview.
You might think so, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I'll be fine without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother's a Danish. Father is a Danish Norwegian.
The family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, the family moved to Namibia because of Dad's work, then to Pakistan.
After that, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were in turn.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is trained by three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than in the United States.
In the United States, coachers ask for nothing but rules.
In Norway, coaching has much more time to be involved in personal dealings with a athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records at 400 meters and 400 metres in a fence race.
The more so, the snowboarder Janne Korven took the whole career to a stakeout - now with him at the World Cup: "It's funny not going to happen."
It's been nice to count now, since it's never happened to anything!
Janne Korpi, 31, the most successful snowboarders in Finland have actually enjoyed their beloved species in this season.
Last summer, the career continued to be at stake.
The foot injury had forced the Korve to operate in January, and the leg was not to heal.
The hand had been hit in the boxing too.
In the summer, I didn't know what I was doing, whether I'm going to go onboard or not.
Sponsoridills were on break, and a lot of things are open, Korpi tells us.
But that's what they're saying, it's a habit of doing things right.
The foot improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to draw again to the front.
After that, it was easy.
I knew it at the latest when I first went to snow.
I was like, damn it, but this is so much fun again, let's do it a couple more times.
The basket was able to count properly only in September-October, but after a long break, just painless training has been a big deal.
There's only a few races around the Korpi.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding for Korvelle.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to target four years for one race, and then you're hot for that week.
I can't think that, Korpi says.
Today, Korpi's race is being held in the half of the World Championships in Sierra Nevada in Spain.
Even though individual races do not like him on the board, he always starts to get on with his hard company.
According to Korven, the appreciation of the international skiing union's competitions has increased over the last few years, even though some of them chose Norway's X-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, the visibility is great.
However, in my opinion, appreciation always depends on the circumstances and the level in the race.
The basket is the oldest athlete of the Finnish 12-person team in Sierra Nevada.
The deaths of the team, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekah and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to follow the way younger friends go.
I remember when it was at the time that everything was new and so excited about everything.
It's gonna bring itself a new power, too, Korpi's gonna think.
I'm still in the middle of something, but I'm not, that's what's going on in my friends!
In the background of the Saturday career Janne Korpi has also built a different sport career.
The director's legend Pekka Korve's son is caught up in food sports: the plates have their own diets for which he is doing training programs.
When I'm on a trip all the time, there's no time for it to be in the mess.
But every day I look at at at least the results and usually something from the departures, Korpi tells me.
According to Korve, medical guidance and medical training are a potential career plan when the boarding career comes to an end.
I don't think I'm going to plan that far, but at least that's the most likely option.
I'm going to experience it a little bit like studying it right next to the snowboarding.
I'm trying to keep the time up and develop, maybe in the summer, I'm just trying to run something out of my way.
If it's my future profession, then it won't be hard to start when it's already finished inside the species.
The medical articles also include the Elitloppet therapy with the host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The twin has rented a cruise ship to the Stockholm Elitloppet therapeutic contest at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to relive the old tradition.
It's been a good deal, and people have been very excited.
We're already at the point where there's no bankruptcy.
There's a few more months left, let's hope we can fill the ship, Korpi says he's excited.
Attendo's nursing home project for Kite has surprised everything
Attendo Ester is the name of a new care home for 41-placed elderly people built by Kiteelle.
The building of a large 1,700 flat-salinery is completed next summer on the other side of the health centre’s neighbor’s Health Services.
The issue of general wonders is where customers are sufficient for the new treatment unit, as during Siu's war many private care homes are being hit by customer shortages.
Anne Flint Attendo, Regional Manager of Health Services, commented that Kite will have more demand in the future not only for alternatives but also for an enhanced service residence.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, Flank says.
Attendo bought private care homes in Kite last year from Kanervikola and Eerika.
The trade was about business, but the real estate is known to be a five-year lease.
Flint says that Attendo has no acute need to move operations out of these facilities.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continuation of McVitie's brand's Scottish plant
The trade union is seeking confirmation from McVitie's manufacturer's leaders of a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the GMB Section of the General Trade Union of Great Britain, the company has not reported its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea factory manufactures more than 500 employees.
The Pladis company owned by McVitie's brand said that it invested more than five million pounds in the factory in recent years.
The company added that the employees and trade union representatives would be "the first" if there were changes to the operation.
In its letter to the Executive Director, GMB invites the company "to take care that no funding has been provided for the modernisation of production lines".
The GMB Trade Union Drew Duffy is very concerned that no clear information can be obtained from the company manager about the needs of Tollcross's business and future investment plans.
"The families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has been strongly concentrated in the local community and in the metropolitan area of Glasgow.
From the point of view of employment, wages and income, and from the point of view of Brexiti, the increasing cost of living and the continuous reduction of production, Eastern Glasgow urgently needs a successful McVitie's production."
According to the report by Pladis, the director had only received a letter from the trade union on the previous day and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates the constant interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we had an open debate on a number of issues.
We discussed with workers, among other things, the fact that, like other companies operating in a very competitive and uncertain market, we are constantly evaluating all our business activities and operating points in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the notifier, in recent years, the company has invested more than 5 million pounds in the Tollcross plant, especially in its production lines and operations.
"We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a production facility, and we will certainly tell the first employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the operation of the factory."
Did PSG Barcelonaa warn you about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret her interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar's target after payment of GBP 189 million for the termination of the transfer contract, but did PSG warn Barcelona about its previous transfer three years ago?
Sensational transfer is the most spoken event in the summer. The French League 1 football team is ready to break the world record of vermin. The previous record was less than half the smaller: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with an amount of 89 million pounds of transfer.
After the transfer, Neymar becomes the most expensive football player in the world and also the world's best paid professional athlete, as PSG offers him over 500 000 pounds of weekly pay after tax.
Barcelona is known to be very upset about the activities of PSG and the way in which Neymar has left the company. The source near Barcelona tells us that the company has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of PSG warn the football world about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that he was interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG’s best players to pursue clubs.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they're looking for our players, we'll become their opponents and contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they're looking for our players, they'll have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have committed this point: it expressed its interest in the midfield player of PSG Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances. It might well be that Barcelona would therefore lose its star player Neymar.
The liquid brake the market's rise - Exchange news - Night Sanomat
The second big newser of the day, Metsä Board, was left with a more glamorous fall.

"I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that two calls made by President Donald Trump, U.S. President, never happened, says New York Times.
Trump's cigaretteed calls with both the Mexican President and the head of the Coastal Organization have proved to be invented.
The White House reporter Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
But he said Trump didn't lie.
According to Sanders, many of the patrol leaders spoke to Trump personally, and Trump had discussed with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the Hamburg G20 meeting.
I wouldn't say it was a lie. It's a pretty big charge.
Those conversations took place, they didn't just happen on the phone, but on face to face, Sanders justified.
The speech to the Boy Scouts woke up evil.
On Monday Trump told me that the Mexican president called him and said that Trump had succeeded in overcoming illegal migration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told me that few people come across the southern border of Mexico no longer because they know the way to the U.S. border in any case.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government published a report in which it said that the call had not been made.
On Tuesday, Politico published a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
That's what Trump was talking about at the big meeting of the National Coastal Organisation in West Virginia.
I got a call from the head of patrol shops, he said it was the finest speech ever made to them.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the patrol organisation announced that it was not aware of the call by any of its executives to Trump.
According to the press, the previous statement by Michael Surbaugh, director of the organization, in which he had asked Trump to apologize to the patrolmen, speaks for himself.
Trump's speech at the meeting of the Boy Scouts' Association raised a great deal of amazement, as it was an exceptional political one in relation to the nature of the event.
He, among other things, set out the results of last autumn's presidential elections.
