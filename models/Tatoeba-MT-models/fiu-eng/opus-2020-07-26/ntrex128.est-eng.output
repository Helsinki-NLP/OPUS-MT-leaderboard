The members of the Wales National Assembly are afraid to look like the Muppets.
Some members of the National Assembly have missed the recommendation to turn their title into MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Member of the Wales Parliament).
The theme has begun to turn the name of the National Assembly into the Wales Parliament.
Representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this can lead to ridicule.
One member of the National Assembly of Laborists said that his teammates are concerned because it is covered by the words Twp and Pwp.
For the explanation of readers outside Wales: the term "daft" means the napak and pwp means the cock.
A member of the board said that the whole group is “not happy” and has offered other names.
According to a member of the Conservative Private of Wales, his group views the name change ‘sponsibly’ but noted that the word ‘MWP’ is very similar to the word ‘Muppet’.
For the explanation, the letter w sound is similar to that of the English language of Yorkshire.
The National Assembly Committee, which is currently drawing up a draft law on change of name, said: "The final decision on all the names to which the members of the National Assembly are invited shall, of course, be taken by the members themselves."
The Law of 2017 of the Government of Wales gave the Wales National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public survey on proposals for the name, which supported widely the idea of re-electing the National Assembly as a parliament in Wales.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the term ‘Wales Members or WMPs’, but the participants in the public poll were most in favour of the MWP option.
Members of the Assembly are likely to propose other names, but reaching an agreement may be a test for President Elin Jones, who should present a draft law on amendments in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules for the withdrawal of the members of the National Assembly and the structure of the Committee system.
The final vote on the appointment of members of the National Assembly shall be left to the members during the discussion of the legislative act.
The Macedonians organise a referendum on the amendment of the country's name
On Sunday, the voters will vote whether or not their country should be referred to as "The Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum will be held with a view to resolving the dispute with Greece in the neighbouring country, which has its province of Macedonia, for decades.
Athens has long argued that its northern neighbours’ name represents the requirement for this territory and has repeatedly objected to the EU and NATO as a member of the candidate.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, has said that he intends to reject the vote.
The referendum advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, state that the change in name is only a price that the State would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells shut down because the Harlem Churches are in trouble
“The older people I've been talking to have said that there was a bar and a church on each corner,” said Mr Adams.
"It's neither of us."
He said that the absence of bars is understandable.
"Man communicates differently today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhood where people live every day."
As far as churches are concerned, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders hope, and "they will be back sooner or later".
Adams added that churches can be replaced with apartment buildings full of people who do not pass the rest of the neighborhood's remaining churches' hands.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he added, “who will therefore speed up the progress of this day when all these churches close their doors because it is unlikely that most people living here will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built the white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis — Metropolitan Community built in 1870, the Holy Martin Church ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The Black congregation, who had so far worshiped God, took over the property rights of the building.
The Afro-American congregation of St Martin's Church was a leading ruse with John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott against the 125th Street shops of Harlem's main shopping street when they refused to hire or promote black men.
In the 1939 fire, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson’s congregation members planned to rebuild the building, they introduced a box or watch game.
Father Johnson's son and officer at St Martin's Church, Reverend David Johnson called the carolion with pride “the bells of the poor people.”
However, the expert who played the Carlion of July gave it a second name: "cultural value" and "inseparable historical tool".
He also noted that this is the world's first career played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play a bigger career 18 years ago in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said that the Church of St Martin did not replace him.
The past months of the Holy Martin Church have been a story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been accompanied by secular leaders, other bishops.
In the church’s premier or secular leaders, the governing body of the congregation complained in writing to the bishop in July that the bishop was “supervising the costs,” even though the presence of architects and contractors sent by the bishop was not even linked to the remuneration of the bishops and contractors.
Some members of the association complained about poor transparency in the activities of the bishops.
In California, a 13-year-old hoarse boy was injured by a shark.
According to the authorities, a 13 - year - old boy was attacked and injured by a shark who dived into California on the opening day of the lobster season for lobsters.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in Beacon's Beach near Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boys' arms and then swimd in with others to help the boy get out of the water.
According to Hammel, he initially thought that the boy expressed his zeal for the arrival of the lobster, but “he realized that the boy was screaming, ” he was bitten!
I was bitten!"
His entire armpit was exposed," Hammel described the sight he saw when he reached the boy.
"I told everyone that they would come out of the water, "There's a shark in the water!", added Hammel.
In a life-threatening situation, the boy was taken to a kid's hospital in San Diego with a plane.
The species of attacked sharks are still unknown.
At the press conference, the VC and Captain Larry Giles said that the shark had been wet in the area a few weeks earlier, but then it was established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were at the top of the body.
The authorities closed for 48 hours access to Ponto Beach, located in Ecinita, for research and safety purposes from Casablanca to Swamin.
Giles added that more than 135 species of sharks exist in the region, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to take over the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's taking over Boosts, Superdrug and Debenhams' chains, creating supermarketed beauty exchanges, where expert advisors also work.
As part of an important invasion to the UK's GBP 2.7 billion beauty market, which continues to be on the rise in sales of fashion and domestic goods, the wider series of beauty products will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be introduced in other stores next year if successful.
The investment in beauty products is due to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to make use of the shelf space previously allocated for televisions, microwaves and domestic goods.
Sainsbury's said it plans to double the selection of its beauty products up to 3000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
Existing product choices from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more room in brands like those currently found in Boosts stores.
It also brings supermarket back to the market its series of makeup products Boutique, where most of the products are suitable for vegans, as young buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop is testing exclusive sales license in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second one opened this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping in the water and moving from local food stores to the daily purchase of small quantities of food means that supermarkets need to try more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury, has said that sales sites are becoming more and more similar to supermarkets, as the supermarket chain seeks to combat cheap chains such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury's has put Argos' sales sites in hundreds of stores, the same with Habitatis' sales sites, since Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago, which allegedly supported the sale of food products and made acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by Supermarket to upgrade its department of beauty and treatment products ended with failure.
Sainsbury experimented with Boosts at the beginning of the 2000s, but it ended with an argument on how to share the proceeds of selling pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after the sale of its 281 sons in Sainsbury three years ago for $125 million to Celesio, which includes the entire Lloyds Pharmacy trade chain.
The strategy also plays its role in Lloyds, adding its four stores to the range of luxury skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
The business manager of Sainsbury, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: “We have changed the appearance and nature of our beauty products in order to improve the environment for customers.
We have also spent money on workers who have received special training who are always willing to advise.
Our brand selection corresponds to every need. The surrounding environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a competing destination for beauty trade, which can change old ways of buying."
Peter Jones is a mischief because Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million dollars
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left the "maruvil" when the TV host Holly Willoughby gave up a 11 million dollar transaction in his lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby is losing time for the brand Truly.
A couple of business is compared with the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop.
The 37-year-old head of this Morning TV show announced that he was leaving Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den's star in the anger of Peter Jones taking out their luxury lifestyle brands in the last minute to focus on his new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The Source said that Jones was “marudhane” when the television star girl admitted at a tight meeting that took place on Tuesday at the man’s business empire headquarters in Marlows Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts in worth of GBP 1.5 million mean that she no longer has enough time to devote herself to the brand Truly of domestic clothing and clothing.
The business is compared with the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop and it was thought to double Willoughby’s estimated GBP 11 million assets.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of his vacation homes.
One source said: “Truly was certainly the main priority for Holly.
It was supposed to secure his further future, so the woman thought she was doing it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave was left with total confusion about the matter.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to placing the product series on the market.
There's a warehouse in Marlow's headquarters full of ready for sale."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of one of the British most paid fame on TV “This Morning” television shows that millions can be paid to the company, since products with a choice ranging from divan batteries and candles to clothing and household clothing have been invested in a bald amount, and may also be accompanied by later placing on the market.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Cappi in 2016. The 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as chairman in March.
Couples go on holiday together, and Jones has 40% stake in Baldwin's teleproduction company.
Willoughby becomes a M&S brander, and he turns out Ant McPartlin's ITV TV series "I'm A Celebility".
One of Jones' close sources said last night: "I don't want to comment on his business."
Hard talk, "because of what we fell in love"
Trump was joking about the criticism that was directed at him in the news for a comment that some considered "deservable" to the President, and for excessive positiveness to the North Korean Head of State.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with the voice of his disgusting "resecting band":
"I have not given up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards abandonment of North Korea's nuclear weapons.
But negotiations for a nuclear ceasefire have stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the world at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see the US as a "responsible response" to the initial positions of North Korea's disarmage.
He noted that the US would continue to impose pressure restrictions on the country in the future.
Trump's incentive point of view was much worse.
"We're going very well with North Korea," he said.
“The war was about to start with North Korea.
Millions of people would be dead.
Now everything's fine between us."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought good results: there have been completed missile attempts, has been helped to release hostages and has been organized to bring American servants' remains to the country.
He also defended his unusual communication with Kim.
“To be a president is very easy, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait outside for this full-blown stadium, it is better if we have nearly 200 people here,” Trump said, referring to the crowd in front of us.
The tsunami and earthquake destroy the Indonesian island, killing hundreds of people
In the event of an earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their aid was not needed.
Although more than ten percent of Lombok’s population had to be relocated, a national disaster was not declared a prerequisite for international aid.
“In many cases they have expressed very clearly that they do not want international aid, so that the stories are a little complicated,” said Mrs Sumbung.
While the organization Save the Children put together a team to go to Palus, it is not clear whether foreigners can work in the region.
Mr Sutopo, the National disaster agency's spokesperson, said that the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation in Palus in order to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to assistance.
Given how frequent earthquakes are in Indonesia, the country is surprisingly little prepared to deal with natural power.
Although asylums have been built in Aceh for the tsunami, they have not been particularly common in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was given about the tsunami, the manifest lack of the tsunami alert siren increased the number of likely deaths in the request.
Traveling between numerous islands of Indonesia is also quite challenging at the best.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult there.
The hospital ship stopped in Lomboki to treat the victims is heading to Palus, but at least three days are needed to arrive at the new accident site.
President Joko Widododo has turned Indonesia into a central part of its electoral campaign for the improvement of broken infrastructure and has distributed money on roads and railways.
However, the budget deficits threaten Mr Joko's government, as the new elections will take place next year.
Mr Jokot’s tensions in Indonesia are also under pressure among those who leave, where members of the majority Muslim community have turned to an older form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes because of the struggles between the Christian and Muslim forces in the streets, where machetes, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons were used.

The shape of Parliament Cromwell is the last monument that is the reason for the "rewrite of history" fight
To eliminate it would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in the Taliban’s style by men’s inhumane followers.
But Cromwell's organization described Mr. Cririck's recommendation as stupidity and attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, Chairman of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In the debate on the disposal of images, it was impossible to remain inviolable to the monument before Oliver Cromwell’s Westminster palace.
Cromwell did not loot pictures of the English civil war himself, nor told others to do so.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell man's ancestor, Thomas, was sacrificed for the works of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent Cromwell presentation is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the history description of the person who, in the opinion of many people, still ought to be respected."
Mr Goldsmith said to the newspaper The Sunday Telegraph: “A lot of people thought that at the end of 19 rather than today that Cromwell was the defender of this Parliament, outside pressure and in this case, of course, for the king’s power.
Whether this is an exact reflection is an endless historical dispute.
It is certain that the fight between the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our people and that Cromwell clearly represents this gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve celebration and commemoration."
The Chinese farmer was killed by a killer.
According to local media records, in southwest China, a farmer was attacked by a pig who killed a man.
A man who was identified with only his last name, Yuan, was found dead by a injured artery and lost in blood from the pig church near the Liupanshui market in Guizhou Province, reported the South China newspaper “Morning Post”.
Manufacture of seafarers on 30 May 2005 in Xingin, Qinghai Province, China, to vaccinate pigs in their desk.
It was claimed that he had come to Yunnan with his cousin on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, a man’s cousin found him dead and discovered that the accompanying sister had been open.
He said that the merger was big, bloody-mouthed.
The investigation of forensic experts confirmed that 249,47 kilograms of shells had, according to the report, been cut to death by the farmer.
"My cousin's feet were all bloody and smote," the newspaper “Guiyang Eventing News” transmitted the words of the cousin Wu.
The security camera tapes showed that Yuan entered the market on Thursday morning at 04:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The marketing director told Eventing News that the pig was locked up so that he could not attack anyone else until the police were able to collect evidence.
Yuan's family and market leaders are allegedly discussing compensation for the man's death.
Although rarely, it has also been observed earlier that pigs attack humans.
In 2016, the pig wife and her husband were attacked in their Massachusetts farm.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 294,83 pounds [29,83 kg] was nailed to a tractor by a farmer in Wales until a man's wife scared him away from the animal.
When a farmer in Oregon ate off his own pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs would not normally attack, but because of the taste of blood, they could get away with it.
“They’re just playful.
They are very curious pirates whose aim is not to hurt them.
They just have to be told enough," said the man.
Orkan Rosa’s after-winds bring extensive rainstorms in the southwest of the United States
According to the forecasts, the hurricane Rosa is weakened, moving across the northern coast of Mexico towards the cooler waters.
However, in the near days of Rosa will bring over rainfalls in North Mexico and in the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday morning at 05:00 east coast, Rosa was classified as a first-class hurricane with windy winds of 136,78 km, standing 619,59 miles south of the southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there will be a low pressure on the Pacific that will move eastward towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the tropical storm on Monday to the Baja California Peninsula, it will lead deep tropical moisture towards the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will reach Mexico, where it's raining up to 25,4 centimeters.
The tropical humidity reacting to the approaching low pressure will then produce extensive strong rainfalls in the southwest of the country in the coming days.
At times, between 2.54 and 10.16 centimeters of rain, caused by dangerous sudden fires, flood water, and possible paints in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture causes an increase in rainforests between five and about seven and a half centimeters per hour, especially in South Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected that between 5,08 and 10,16 centimeters of rainfalls in certain areas of the southwest of the United States, especially in Arizona.
Acute fires are possible due to the rapid degradation of tropical rains.
Certainly, if tropical rainfalls are at risk, you should not walk in the desert.
A strong rain can cause the canyons to turn into high-speed rivers and lightning storms at times accompanied by a fluttering windfall and air-flowing dust.
At times, the approaching low pressure leads to acute rainfalls in southern California coastal areas.
It is possible that the total amount of rainfalls is more than 1.27 centimeters and can cause smaller flood water and liberate roads.
This would be the first harvest in the region during the rainy season.
Drunked tropical rainfalls will approach Arizona on Sunday nights and Monday mornings, rainfalls will become wide on Monday night and Tuesday.
Strong rainheads reach Four Corner on Tuesday and stay until Wednesday.
In October, high temperature fluctuations in the US are predicted as a result of the cooling of the Arctic, while temperatures remain high in tropical areas.
Sometimes this leads to major changes in temperature in small areas.
The Sunday weather represents an excellent example of significant variations in temperature in the central part of the United States.
The temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebbraska) as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) range to almost 20 degrees.
In the next few days, he'll try to get himself back together in a long summer heat.
A large part of the central and eastern part of the United States is expected to begin a warm October month with a wide range of temperatures around 80 warm wires from the south to the northeast.
In New York, there are 26,6 warm wires on Tuesday, approximately 10 degrees above average.

Brett Kavanaugh's trial looked at over 20 million people
Over 20 million people on Thursday, six television channels, Brett Kavanaugh, a High Court candidate, and he was alleged to be accused of sexual violence by a woman named Christine Blasay Ford.
At the same time, political congestion continued, where broadcasters interrupted displaying regular broadcasts to reflect the last minute's turns: Senator Jeff Flake prepared a contract for the FBI to conduct one week's prosecution.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs that it was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh would grab him drunk and try to tear his clothes off at high school.
Kavanaugh said in his cherry confession that it was absolutely certain that it did not happen.
The transfer is likely to have been reviewed by more than 20.4 million people on Friday, according to Nielsen’s report.
The company calculated the average audience on the television channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels showing this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has problems in calculating the number of people who are looking at transfers by the authorities.
The comparison is that it's about the same size as the audience if there's a football final tournament or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel opinion leaders who have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh led all networks with an average of 5,69 million viewers throughout the day, said Nielsen.
The ABC 3,26 million viewers remained on the other side.
CBS had 3.1 million, 2.94 million NBC, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, said Nielsen.
After the trial, the interest remained high.
Flake was the central character of the Friday drama.
Following the submission by the Moderate Republic Office of a statement that he was voting for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS were hit by cameras on Friday morning after he had come to the meeting of the Legal Affairs Committee by the protesters.
He was standing on the ground for several minutes when he was accused and it was directly across CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the state the truth?"
He was told: “You have power, while so many women have been completely powered.”
Mr Flake said that his department issued a statement and added that he had more to say at the Committee on Legal Affairs before closing the elevator.
The direct transmission of cable and broadcasting networks was recorded several hours later when the Committee on Legal Affairs had to vote to forward the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate Assembly for voting.
But Flake said that he would only do this in the sense that the FBI will investigate the charges against the candidate next week, which have been claimed by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced to have a conversation with a friend of the Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with the Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
The Flake decision had an impact because it was obvious that the Republicans would not be able to bring together the votes of Kavanaugh without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation in connection with Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May blames Brexit critics in a political game
The Prime Minister accused the newspaper of an interview with the Sunday Times of criticising his plans for leaving the European Union, of a "political game" with the future of Britain and of damaging national interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the conservative party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview on the newspaper Theresa May with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson put pressure on his attack on May so-called Brext's coat plan, saying that the proposal on the basis of which Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs is "a whole brainless".
Shoot Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of murdering the LSU player.
Police arrested a man suspected of shooting the 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims killed.
Twenty-year-old Dyton Simpson was arrested and arrested in prison for second-degree murder, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published a video of the opposition between Sims and Simpson, and the police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, informed CBS on the television channel WAFB.
After the Simpson interview, the police said he confessed to the shooting at Wayde.
The lawyer announced that the male bail was set at 350 000 US dollars (308 600.30 euros).
On Friday, the president of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that death was caused by a bullet wound in his head in the neck area.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the state police laboratory, the Southern University police, and the people living in the region for their assistance in investigating, which led to the arrest of a suspect.
Joe Alleva, head of sports, thanked the law enforcement authorities in the region for “supervising safety and justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
A man of 1,98 metres grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball in LSU.
His previous season's average was 5.6 points and 2.6 table balls.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the whole team was "cut" and "shoked" due to Wayde's death.
"It's something you're always worried about," Wade said.
Vulkan's going to burst ash over Mexico City.
The ash from the volcano called Popocatepet has reached the southern parts of the southern city of Mexico.
The National Centre for the Prevention of Disasters warned the mechanics on Saturday by ordering them to stay away from the volcano, as the crater again started the activity, which resulted in 183 cases of gas emissions and ash decontamination recorded within 24 hours.
The Centre set up a number of myriads and colors.
The images distributed in social media represented fronts of a ash-coated car in different parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimillco.
Geophysics noticed an increase of 72 km from the capital after the 7,1 magnetic earthquake was bitten by the central part of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano named Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police are in contact with Katotaonia separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested by the independent protesters in Barcelona, following the conflict of the protesters with the Weruli Police. Thousands joined the protests to celebrate the opposite vote on the deportation of Catalonia.
The group was masqueraded by fighters who were holding back the pine police, attacking the last eggs and powder paint, creating thick clouds of dust on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
There was also roses later when the police had to use the knives to control the fights.
Several hours of no oblivion, no forgiveness, the supporters of independence collapsed with the dissatisfactionists who called “The Life of Spain”.
According to the local press, medical assistance was provided by a person with a minor injury at 14 demonstrations.
The efforts will continue to be set up in the region supporting independence one year later, when Madrid declared that the referendum on 1 October was illegal, but which was still marked by catalans.
The voters decided overwhelmingly to benefit from independence, although the electoral activity was low, because the votes against the withdrawal were largely ignored by those who were against the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to vote against the voting groups of the whole region, leading to violent conflicts.
On Friday night, those in favour of independence had spent the night in front of the voting sections in order to avoid demonstrations supporting the national police.
However, the demonstrations took place, but they had to take another way.
Narcis Termes, working as a 68-year-old electrician, who took part in the protests in favour of separation with his wife, said that he had no hope of seeing Katalonia on his own.
“One of the best moments of our lives took place last year.
I saw my parents crying out happy to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the important but small-scale regional elections that took place last December, the parties supporting the independence of the Catalan have been difficult to maintain this year's power of action, since many more well-known leaders have either gone to exile or have been held and are waiting for judgment on their part in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who is recording a demonstration to support the police with his cell phone, said that the fight was repressed by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more intense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalans who have been in the penitentiary since the previous year, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"The best way to apply for elections in the European Parliament is to condemn the restoration of democratic values and the pressure of the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: The man was arrested because he was housed in a house with a car.
Three men were arrested at 33, 34 and 39 years of age after the car in Londonderry was repeatedly scrapped into the house.
The case took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 a.m. on British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that the damage was caused to the gates and the building.
They could also have let you go to the car at some point.
The Menga blows Livingston 1-0 wins in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston was to win
Successful Livingston open Rangers to take Steven Gerrad to second loss in 18 games when a man has been the manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved decisive when Gary Holt raised the level to Himernian in a second.
Gerrad will remain in the first league of the season and will meet the leading Hearts next Sunday, with eight points on the ground.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in Euroliiga.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended its undefeated attack to seven games, while the head coach Holt still felt the taste of losing since Kenny Miler was replaced by a month ago.
Livingston loses the opportunity for the users of shorts.
Holt's team should have been running the gate long before they hit the gate, as their immediate play style caused Rangers any problem.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts began to shake in front of the gate where Alan Lithgow made efforts to catch Craig Halkett's top of the gate.
The strangers calmly allowed Rangers to play in front of themselves, knowing that they could cause problems for guests in certain places.
And that's the way the gate was hit.
The Rangers gave up the free strike and Livingston the opportunity to play with Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Men, who took the ball and succeeded in it in the middle of the penalty area.
By this time, the Rangers mainly held the ball, but could not penetrate the defense, so the gatekeeper Liam Kelly was mainly calm.
The same pattern continued during the second half, although Alfredo Moreelos once forced Kelly to protect the gate.
The Rangers' gateman, Allan McGregor, rejected Scott Pittman's blow and Lithgow was bright in another team of Livingston.
The attacks continued to enter the Livingston penalty area and were consistently removed from it, and two penalty attacks were also directed away, one for the attempt to replace Halkett Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
Phenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland in Alaska Lamont Tony Macaroni Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Every player was great, crossing the ladder upwards, moving up completely into expectations.
Their game style and players have hardly changed since they returned to the top level, but we must pay tribute to Holt for how he has punished the team since he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, providing excellently organized protection while Menga was holding Connor Goldson and Joe Worralt on the back legs of the game.
The Rangers, though, had some inspiration.
Notwithstanding their being at a good level under Gerardi’s leadership, it would be few of these examples.
Their last holding of the ball proved to be incomplete: reaching their home party was only once that could function as an alarm clock for the Rangers located in the central part of the table.
Responsible reception of Erdogan in Cologne
There were smiles and worries in Berlin on Saturday (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's conflicting German visit to improve relations between NATO allies.
They are excluded from matters concerning human rights, freedom of the press and accession of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan Köln then headed to open a new giant mošee.
The largest Turk community in the city is outside Turkey.
The police referred to security by prohibiting the accumulation of 25,000 members in front of the Mošee, but a number of supporters appeared near it to see their president.
Hundreds against Erdogan, a large proportion of whom are deaf, also made their voice heard, condemned both Erdogan's politics and the German Government's decision to host the Turkish President in his own country.
The fighting demonstrations show that the attitude toward the guest is divided: some of the Turks in Germany welcome him as a hero, while others despise a man as a self - rule.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: cyclists were killed as a result of a car crash
In London, a cyclists were killed.
A collision took place near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street on a fast road in Deptford, in the south-east of town about 10:15 a.m., according to British summertime.
The driver stopped and the help arrived to provide an ambulance doctor, but he died at the scene.
There was a collision a few months after the second cyclists were killed about two kilometers from the Saturday crash on Childers Street, where the driver who ran off the biker fled from the scene.
The London police said the authorities were involved in identifying a man and informing his loved ones.
The event site is closed and the buses are re-directed, drivers of motor vehicles are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison officials were injured in the riots
The prison authorities reported that six prison officials were injured in the very calm of men in a very secure prison.
The peace broke out in His Majesty's Long Lartin prison at Worcestershire on Sunday at 09:30, after British summertime and not yet finished.
One of the wings is concentrated on the unrest of eight prisoners.
The prison officials were treated with more minor facial injuries at the scene.
He said: “Further - trained prison workers have been invited to resolve the current case in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Five crew members received medical attention due to injuries.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, they will be transferred to the police and their imprisonment may be extended."
In HMP Long Lartin there are over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the warden was informed that he was taken to hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, however, wearing officers were invited to prison to silence serious unrests during which prison officers were attacked with pool hearings.
Orkan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden fires (orcass can be useful for the rest of the regions)
The tropical low pressure environment does not hit Arizona often, but it is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week when the straiting hurricane Rosa moves across the southwest desert, leading to the risk of sudden fires.
The National Weather Service has already arranged for surveillance of sudden fires in the western part of Arizona on Monday and Tuesday, in the south and east part of Nevada, in the south of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the reminder, Rosa is headed straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area with rainfalls on Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service found that “at the beginning of 1950 only ten tropical cyclons have maintained the level of tropical storm or low pressure area within a radius of 321,86 miles [31,86 km] from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed from a distance of 64,37 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest national orcanic center models predict a rainfall of between 5,08 and 10,16 centimeters, which may reach the restricted areas of Arizona Mogolon Rim up to 15,24 centimeters.
In other desert areas of the U.S., including the central part of the Kaljumäe and the Great weakness, the number of rainfalls is likely to be between 2,54 and 5,08 centimeters, reaching restricted areas up to 10.16 centimeters.
The rains of Rosa may be a blessing to the sturdy areas, as the area is in the hand of the drought.
Although floods are very worrying, such rainfalls are likely to be useful as droughts exist in Southwest America.
According to the U.S. drought monitor, at least 40% of Arizona’s extreme, i.e. the size of the second category, informed Weather.com.
First, the Orca Rosa Baja California Peninsula crosses the land of Mexico.
Rosa, still at the Orcan level on Sunday morning, is now 619,95 miles south of Punta Eugene in Mexico, moving at speeds of 19,31 miles an hour north.
The storm comes into contact with the water that cools the Pacific, which is why it's a little quiet.
It is therefore expected that Rosa will reach the land of Mexico with a tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
The number of rainfalls in certain regions of Mexico may be high, causing a significant risk of flooding.
“From modern California to northwest Sonora may be expected to have rainfalls of between 7,62 and 15,24 centimeters, reaching about 25,4 centimeters,” informed Weather.com.
The Rosa is then heading north of Mexico’s tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border at the beginning of the Tuesday morning as a low pressure area already crossing Arizona and reaching the south of Utah on Tuesday night.
“The threat to Rosa or its consequences is very strong rainfalls in Baja California, the Northwest of Sonora and the Southwest desert of the United States,” said the National Orcanic Centre.
These rainfalls can cause life-threatening sudden fires and flooding water in the deserts and paints in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and 20-year-old men were arrested with suspicion of planned murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 4:00 a.m. British summertime.
The victim was transferred to a hospital in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old man, 18 years old and 20-year-old was arrested in the Radstock area in Avon and Someerset, said the police.
Officials are asking to contact anyone who may have a mobile phone record on a case.
Trump said that Kavanaugh 'Cannath' was 'rejoice and anger' of the Democratic Party.
"Court of Support for Kavanaugh is a voice against the unresponsible and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in his inspired speech in Wheelingus, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "cannath" during his appointment process under the Democratic Party's "sufficient and anger".
Kavanaugh was testifying before Congress on Thursday, with a fierce and emotional rejection of Christine Blasay Ford's accusations that he attacked him several decades ago when they were teenagers.
In addition, at the hearing, Ford issued a statement of his accusations.
The president said on Saturday, "America saw the glory, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day".
The voice given to the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is the voice to appoint one of the most valuable law-makers of our time who have an impeccable background in the public service," he said to the support crowd in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while at the same time talking about the importance of the electoral activity of the Republic in the intermediate elections.
“ Five weeks have remained until one of our most important elections in our lifetime.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running for it" he said.
"That is why I am everywhere to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission designed to "report and prevent".
The first main procedural vote on candidate for Kavanaugh on the Senate floor is expected to take place at the latest on Friday, said Senior Assistance to CNN Heads of the Republic's Party.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, the number of deaths is rising
At least 384 people were killed, and many were threatened when Chinese waves hit the beach after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had met on Friday at the beach festival in Palu, when during the first time six metres of waves hit the beach, killing a lot of people and destroying everything that was left on the road.
Tsunam was followed by 7,5 magnetic earthquakes.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people still did their work on the beach, not immediately fled, thus remaining victims,” said the press conference of BNPB pressor Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Jakarta of Indonesia.
“The tsunami did not come alone, but took cars, logs and houses with it, wipe everything out of the ground,” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved at a speed of 800 km an hour before it reached the shore.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of Palu.
Air photos published by the disaster department showed a series of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and congested bridges and water-circuited mošes.
The lakes in the coastal town continued on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million inhabitants, there was a feeling of earthquakes.
The Office for the Evaluation and Implementation of Indonesia (BPPT) stated in its statement that, on Friday after a strong earthquake, the energy released was nearly 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city along the long and narrow Gulf could have increased the strength of the tsunami, said BPPT.
Nugroho described the damage as “indistinct” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have collapsed.
He said that some victim's bodies were found under the rubbles of congested buildings, adding that 540 persons were injured and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and damage could be larger in the coast area north of Palus 300 km, called Dongala, which was closer to the summer of the earthquake.
The messages from Donggala “is completely incomplete and does not contain any information,” said Nugroho.
“There are more than 300 000 residents in the county,” said the Red Cross in its statement, adding that its team and volunteers are heading for the affected places.
"It is already a tragedy that can get even worse," he said.
The Agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not giving notice to the tsunami in the city of Palu, although the authorities said that the waves reached the beach while the warning was issued.
Amateurs in social media can see a man on the upper floor of a building, warning people of the approaching tsunami on a panicous street.
A few minutes later, the water wall will reach the beach, carrying houses and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to confirm immediately the accuracy of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large power failure that prevented communication in the Palu region and made it difficult for the authorities to carry out rescue work.
The army has started sending transport aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuationers still need food and other basic equipment.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue work, remaining closed in other parts until October.
President Joko Widododo plans to visit the evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of deaths due to the Indonesian tsunami increased by over 800.
It's really bad.
Although the employees of World Vision from Donggala safely arrived at the city of Palu, where they were in the shadows of their office in the courtyards of presentations, they saw images that were in their way, said Mr Doseba.
"They said that you saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Although the relief operations of disaster relief were taking place forcefully by the aid forces, it complained that workers of foreign aid organisations with high experience were prevented from travelling to Palus.
According to the Indonesian rules, funds, stocks and backups from abroad may only be sent if the accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This continues to be a disaster on the province level,” said Aulia Arrian, a pressman from Indonesia, the Red Cross.
"When the government says, "Okay, it's a national disaster," we can begin to accept international aid, but this state has not yet been declared."
When the second night, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of the missing persons were still filled with hope that their loved ones would be the wonderful events that would ease the fall of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was lifted out of the sewer deck.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who was trapped two days next to her mother’s body under the fists.
In Indonesia, the National Swimwear Team coach Gendon Subandoo trained two lost sliders for Asian games that took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The rest of the people who are trapped at Roa Roa's hotel are his students, added Mr. Mandagi.
“I have a personal burden as a slipper from Senior,” he said.
Mr. Gendon was talking about how, after Roa Roa's release of the hotel's collapse news amongst the band of sliders, he was desperate to send messages to whatsHelp to the contestants who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with only one grey bird instead of two blue birds.
"I think that means that the messages were not made," he said.
Vargad took EUR 23 585.88 during the ATM in Newport on the Levies
On Friday morning, thieves in Newport were stolen from the Brink's ATM staff, EUR 23 585.88, published in the press release of the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptys the ATM at the entertainment facility and manufactures to bring more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in press releases.
When a man acted, “the other man went behind Brink’s staff and stole a delivery bag full of money.
Witnesses saw multiple suspects running from the scene, writing a press release, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
All persons with information on early persons are asked to contact the Newport Police (+01633) on the phone of 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper takes his new name Ye
Rappard Kanye West turns his name Ye.
On Saturday, on Twitter, a man wrote, "The Ancient Kanye West."
Since the 41st year West has been called by the nickname Ye for some time, and the man also used the name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change will take place before his presentation on Saturday Night Live, where a man is expected to publish his new album Yandhi.
He will replace Aria Grandet, who has cancelled his concert “on the bottom of your feelings,” said the author.
In addition to being short of the current name of the man, West has previously said that it is a religious word for him.
"I think "ye" is one of the most useful words in the Bible, which means "syn" there," said West earlier, discussing the name of his album with radio broadcast leader Big Boy.
“This is who I am, this is us, these are us.
I changed my name from Kane, which means "this one," called Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
The Album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye West is not the only rapper who plays his name.
Sean Combs is known mainly under the names of P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that preferred names for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously worked with West, has also used its name with and without reason, with big and small stars.
Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use the army against civilians
At a time when the state approaches the 50th anniversary of the blood attack against the students, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, President of Mexico, has promised that no military will ever be used against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Sunday in Tlatelolco Plaza that “to control the Mexicans never use the army.”
The army attacked the peaceful demonstration in the field on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people during the whole of Latin America to support left-wing student movements.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young mechanics by providing students with monthly grants and opening up more free national universities.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence.
“As China is becoming increasingly active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount allocated to research in this area,” said the donor and artificial intelligence operator Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were published after various parts of the US Government made artificial intelligence statements, although the US does not have an overall formal artificial intelligence strategy.
At the same time, China presented its plan last year to be the player in the renewal of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“The doubled research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so much behind the US, and we are acting on behalf of the next artificial intelligence breakthrough,” Lee said.
Two times the funding would double the likelihood that the next major artificial intelligence achievement would be made in the United States, said Lee CNBC's interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of the most outstanding artificial intelligence companies in China Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a artificial intelligence system that won the best Othello player in America. Later he was at Microsoft Research Board and Google’s Chinese branch president.
Lee recognised the technology competitions of the previous US Government, such as the US Department of Defence research projects Agency robotics Competition (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge) and asked when the next competition would take place to help identify the next dreamers.
“The U.S. scientists have to work hard to get government funding,” Lee said.
“Kina is not the one taking over the Syrians, but they are companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant scientists from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the US to support its artificial intelligence efforts.
“I think people who received a doctoral degree in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically offer a green card,” said the man.
The Chinese National Council published the next generation of artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Science Foundation distributes funding to people working in academic institutions, like the way the National Science Foundation and other government institutions allocate money to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defence set up a centre of artificial intelligence aimed at involving partners from both industry and educational institutions.
That month, DARPA announced that she started funding two million dollars of initiative AI Next.
But the state research fund is currently financing over $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation was not amended, which was designed to establish a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the national name
The Macedonians voted in a Sunday referendum on whether to turn the name of the State into the Republic of Northern Macedonia, a step which would also resolve a decade's dispute with Greece, which has prevented Macedonia from being a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbours’ name constitutes a requirement for this territory and has prohibited Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries agreed in June on the new name of Macedonia, but anti-nationalists claim that the name would undermine the national identity of the Slavic people of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he did not intend to participate in the referendum and that the anti-discrimination campaign has raised doubts as to whether electoral activity achieves the 50% participation rate required to apply the referendum.
The referendum asks: "Are you in favour of the accession of Macedonia to NATO and the EU, agreeing with the agreement reached with Greece?"
The supporters of the roll-call change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price paid by Macedonia, which is one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the youth of Macedonia to live freely under the protective hand of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will follow the result of the vote in order to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is necessary for a change of name.
The National Election Commission said that there are no reports of irregularities at 13:00.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said the 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko gave their vote on the amendment of the country's name in the referendum on 30 September 2018 to allow them to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliamentary building in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage, raising the signs of the tents to those who rejected the referendum.
“We want to belong to NATO and the EU, but we want to join the head up, not through the door of the servants,” said Kavalarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia and get European-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring the necessary investments to Macedonia with an unemployment rate of more than 20 %.
“I believe that a large majority support the change of name, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of EU and NATO,” Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said, "Yes-word" would be "a confirmation of our future".
The results of the survey published by the Institute for Policy Studies in Macedonia on Monday revealed that the referendum intends to take part in 30-43% of voters, which are below the required electoral activity.
The survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said that you would say yes.
The success rate of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure to hold a referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western policy of the government after the government took over the government in May last year.
See: Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero goes to the gate for the sake of protection throughout Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defense, ensuring Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero was impressed by his 65th game minutes, the gate was ridiculously easy.
The Argentinian attacker passed through at the beginning of the central field sequence.
He broke through three Brighton defenders before he got into an open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke through another protector before he ran past several players at the Brighton Penalty Area.
Then he hit the ball to the left where it was Sterling.
The English attacker used the first blow to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit the Brighton Gatekeeper Mathew Ryan to the right of the network.
"Aguerol is a problem with legs," said Manchester City manager to Pep Guardiola reporters.
"We told him he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he hit the gate at that time."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial success of Premier League.
The gate was hit at 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly in Brighton territory.
He sent the ball from the air to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane got to hit a ball a few times before he ran Sterling further.
Sky Blues put the ball on the net right before it slipped out of the border.
Manchester City plays Masters League with Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a cheerleader against Rockies
When the Nationals were sidelined from the final tournament games, there was no real reason to start again.
However, the competitive Scherzer hopes to make a Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but this is only when Rockiel, who is running a game in NL West in Los Angeles's Dodgers, is still hope to get to the final.
Rockies guaranteed at least a river site with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team still wants to secure its first division.
“While we don’t play for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing with this audience and the other team in the atmosphere in Denver is probably higher than any other game that can wait for me this year.
Why shouldn't I want to compete here?"
The Nationals have not yet mentioned a Sunday opening player, but they are claimed to be heading towards Scherzer's bait in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th feeding, made a warm-up session on Thursday and used to feed on Sundays.
This Washington right-handed player is headed by 18-7, its ERA is 2.53, the number of kicks 300, and its 220 2/3 in this season.
Trump's got an incentive call in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court, while talking about the importance of the electoral activity of the Republic in the interim elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before our lifetime, one of the most important elections.
This is a major event in which I do not apply, but I actually apply, which is why I'm all over the place to fight for the great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “See this terrible, extremely extreme group of democracies, you see it happening in front of your eyes.
And they've decided to take back power using any means. You can see their evil and dirty game.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over for power and control, the only thing they want is power and control over everything, and we don't give it to them."
According to him, the Democrats are on a mission designed to "report and prevent".
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "hospitious, wicked, humble and lying."
He referred to a democratic member of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs as Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was cast out loud among the audience.
“ Do You Remember His Answer?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, what?
No, no, wait, it was one of the worst body language examples, in fact the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Laborist Party is no longer a big connection.
It is intolerance to those who express their opinion
When my local party Momentum activists voted to condemn me, it wasn't very surprising.
After all, I am the last person on the list of lobbyists to whom you are told you are not welcome, and all this for the publication of your opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, became part of the same treatment because he was strongly in favour of the anti-Jewish regime.
In my case, the judges judged me for not consulting Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are oddly similar to those on which Jeremy had a disagreement with previous leaders.
In the communication from the East Laborist Party of Nottingham, it stated that “We would like to see the meetings to be inclusive and creative.”
Most of my eight-year local Laborist experience with meetings of the general meeting of Friday evenings is exactly this.
As of today, unfortunately, this will no longer apply to most meetings and the promise to be “devil and generous” in politics has long since been forgotten.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the different aspects are not acceptable in the Labour Party and that, for each opinion, they are acceptable to the Board of the Party.
It started immediately after Jeremy became a leader. A co-worker with whom I thought I was sharing similar political views now expected me to change my mind and take positions that I would otherwise never have accepted, whether it was national security or EU single market issues.
Whenever I step up in public, regardless of what I'm actually saying, it's followed by a judgment on social media, encouraging my return, ignoring party politics and saying that I should not be part of the Leiborist Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been more lucky than some of my fellow workers, because comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the competence and decision-making capacity of those fellow workers who face sexist or racist abuse every day, but never swear.
One of the most disappointing positions in this policy area is how abuse levels have become common.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Leiborist Party should promote tolerance culture.
The reality, however, is that we are no longer such a community and that any change in the "inadmissibility" initiative or the electoral rules will make the parties more narrower.
I have been given a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head on the ground, to speak less, and "it would be fine."
But that's not what I had to do in politics.
From the moment I joined the Leiborist party 32 years ago, motivated by the care of the government of Thatcher, which had left my great school class room literally at the edge of collapse, I have tried to talk about better public services for those who need it most, acting as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last elections.
There is no way that anyone in Nottingham East was confused with my political positions or with local leadership in the areas of non-consolidation.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is moving towards Brexit, which is damaging to households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the Head of the Labour Party.
But in fact, it is not the only message I have, intended for the Momentum of Nottingham, but for my supporters, whether they belong to the Laborist Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise not to stop me from acting in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr moving to the top
Two late events may have led to a slight decline in the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves victory in this wonderfully fun Tennent's first game.
They are now the only unbeatable team in the front of the table.
After all, this team was a high level of protection and better risk taking, which five and coach Peter Murchiel won, is fully entitled to be satisfied.
“We have been tested all the time during the games, and we are still undefeated, so of course I am happy,” he said.
Robyn from Christie Melrose said, "I'm going to give Ayri a story, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute trial, which was taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a success, but to the Scottish captain, Rory Hughes, who was created by Warriors, gave Melros the opportunity to perform a failed test.
Climo increased Ayri's successes by a penalty attack just before the end of the half-time, reaching the end of the individual term in favour of Ayri.
But Melrose successfully started the second half-time, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, which took over Baggot, reduced the gap by five points.
Then a long delay took place due to the serious injury that the man was taken off the truck. As the game continued, the Ayr's success ground increased further thanks to the Stafford McDowall trial, which was transmitted by Climo.
So Blair Macpherson, the company's active captain, was with a yellow card, but again, Melrose's player paid for the attempt of Bruce Colvine to move down after strong pressure.
However, the team playing at the Homefield recovered power again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to stop Climo without a ball on the line of punishment, MacPherson put the ball behind the advanced Brains.
Climo gave the ball forward, as he did almost immediately after continuing the game, when Kyle Rowe tried David Armstrong's cast and sent a side guard to Gregor Henry to go to the homefield on the fifth test of the team.
Still Game star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game's star Ford Kieran seems to be ready to enter the supply service after the man was discovered to be the director of a well-known restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a well-known BBC TV series he writes and plays with a long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
A couple have announced that the ninth season ahead will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan will make new plans for life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is the director of the Ariftmorn Limited company.
The actor refused to comment, but the source of Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to step into the "storious restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours," says Bolivia, without sea borders, hopes that the court will reopen the way for them to the Pacific Ocean.
The sailors patrol the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
The flags of ocean blue lie over the buildings of the Office.
The Marine Bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon has been drawn to the conclusion: “Our right is our right.
It's our responsibility to restore it."
The memory of the coastline that was lost in Chile's bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is completely without the sea borders in Bolivia, and the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean is the same living thing.
These hopes are sometimes highest in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice of 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“The spirit of unity and peace in Bolivia is at work, and the country is naturally waiting for the result,” said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
The Hulk boliivists all over the country look at the decision of the International Court on large screens, hoping that the Hague Court will decide for Bolivia, after which Chile will have to negotiate with Bolivia for decades in order to give the last independent way to the sea.
The charismatic President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who is awaiting the re-election of the conflict next year, will have a lot of weight on Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the Court would probably not vote in favour of Bolivia, or that it would become very little.
The Dutch authorities do not have the power to grant the territory of Chile and have provided that they do not identify the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court will be taken only six months after hearing the final submissions suggests that it was not a "serious case", said Chiil’s expert on international law, Paz Zárte.
And as far as Bolivia’s additional reasons are concerned, the situation may have deteriorated for the last four years.
“The problem of access to the sea has been taken away by the current Bolivian authorities,” Zárate said.
Morales' military beauty speech has lost all remaining Chile's charity, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but then everything will be extremely difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not exchanged their ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision to close was not necessary in time.
The Monday gives Bolivia the opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile and the opportunity to "stop the divorces of 139 years with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most well-known presidents in Latin America, is using the issue of the sea to express a political flaw.
“Boliavia will never give up her right to access the Pacific Ocean,” she added.
"There's a chance to see that we have to get past."
North Korea said that the release of nuclear weapons will not take place until the United States can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will never give up nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the General Meeting of the United Nations on Saturday.
He called on the United States of America to review the promises made by the competitors during the Singapore Summit.
He will comment on this at a time when US State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems almost to be starting again in the impasse of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Uni.
According to Ri, this is an air cargo business, according to the US, the continuing restrictions and refusal to stop the war with Korea makes North Korea give up.
Washington is careful about such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards armament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, scepticism is common, according to which Pyongyang intends to give up seriously the weapon that the state is likely to see as the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on the second Kimi and Trump Summit.
Paris mopes bring to the viewer a series of massive headgear brought to buyers in their neighbourhoods
If you want to increase your hat collection or fully protect yourself from the sun, you will no longer have to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought a series of freaky overcoats to the stage under their 2019 summer season, which blinded Paris’s fashion week.
High and impractical hats are in fashion this summer through Instagram, and these designers have sent their footwear to fashionable works.
Valentino's top piece was the top of the models covered with a top-up beige hat, decorated with a large edge.
Other large clothing accessories included jewels, magic hats, and even pineapples, but their purpose is not to heat up.
Thom Browne also showed a strange choice of masks, doing it in exactly the right time before Halloween.
Most of the colored masks had congested mouths so that they reminded Hannibal Lecter more than high-end.
One part of the creation reminded of the dive costume with the air pipe and glasses, while the other remembered the melted ice cream core.
And if you keep up with the huge moering, you're lucky.
Moagurus predict that oversized roofs can also reach the shopping streets in your vicinity.
The top-sized hats are coming right after La Bomba, which is a shoulder hat of 60 centimeters wide, seen in the head of all the celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A cultural brand that created a highly impractical hat in the social media sent another large piece of work to those who would like to see it – a coastal bag almost as large as the model with its bikini.
The dark orange rafficoach, which has the Raffiaic fools and the white leather mask, was the top work of the summer collection of Jacques La Riviera in Paris on a fashion week.
Luke Armitage, who was famous, said to FEMAIL, “I look forward to seeing large hats and coastal bags in the next summer. Since the designer has had such an impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extremely large clothing.”
John Edward: Language skills are important for world citizens
Scotland's private schools have remained at the top of the academic excellence trend and continued in 2018 with the following outstanding exams that strengthen personal and joint success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, where more than 30,000 students study all over Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Private Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide their students and their parents with the best service.
The aim of private schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can shape and implement a programme adapted to the circumstances, we can see that modern languages are still well-known and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language that you understand, it will come to him.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it will come into his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to create relations and trust with people from other countries.
The recent results of this year's examination show that the languages at the top of the tables are the languages where the level of examination is highest among private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high score of A.
Data collected from a total of 74 SCIS schools show that 72 per cent of students received Mandarin A, the same price received 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
The languages that are now among the choice of subjects are the same in private schools and other schools as in STEM subjects (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics).
The study carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission on Employment and Vocational Skills (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) revealed that, among the reasons why employers find job vacancies, 17% of the respondents had no language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly compulsory to prepare young people for their future work.
In so far as more promising job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in the globalised world.
Notwithstanding the choice of careers made, the acquisition of another language gives a real advantage to a person in the future, as language skills are life-long.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign nationals confers an immediate competitive advantage on a multilingual person.
According to a survey by YouGov conducted in more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent of the respondents do not speak any foreign language well enough to have this conversation. The only language with a two-digit percentage was French 15 percent.
This is why the funding of language learning is important to children today.
A number of languages, especially those with emerging economies, provide children with better opportunities to find good work.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
The Hulk School focuses more on classical modern languages, while other schools teach languages considered most important in the United Kingdom in view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Notwithstanding the interests of the child, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between a number of languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the necessary skills to achieve success regardless of what the future will bring them.
It can no longer be denied that, in a global business environment, languages are crucial for the future of the country, which also needs to be reflected in education.
It is true that modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Private schools continue to provide young shockers with choices, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Private School Board.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
Intense respecters don't have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut in L.A. Lakers.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will play in the premarital opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But his number of play minutes still needs to be determined.
“It’s more than one and less than 48,” said Walton Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell's sparkle that James is likely to play the read number of minutes.
After last week’s training, James was asked about his plans for the six-game premiere schedule of Lakers.
“I don’t need my career at the current stage of the presiding games to warm myself,” he said.
Trump Western Virginia election campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts his election campaign event series tonight in Wheelingus West Virginia.
This is Trump's first campaign event planned for the next week, including stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
At the same time as the confirmation vote stands until Trump chooses who will be appointed to the Supreme Court's seat, he will seek to increase support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans will be threatened by the abolition of control after the vote in November in Congress.
What time is Trump tonight's campaign event in Western Virginia and how to watch it on the Internet?
The Trump campaign event in Wheelingus West Virginia will take place on Saturday evening, 29 September 2018 at 7 p.m. on the east coast.
The Trump Western Virginia campaign event can be viewed online via YouTube streaming.
The Trump High Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, is probably talking about this week's sittings that became tense in connection with charges related to sexual abuse, and at the same time, the Senate's confirmation vote has been suspended for a week until the FBI investigates the matter.
However, the main aim of the series of campaign events is to help the Republicans face complex elections in November.
Thus, President Trump's campaign leader said that the aim of these five events next week is to "enhance volunteers and supporters if the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority of their members in the Senate and the Board of Governors," Reuters mediated.
“The control of the Congo is so important for the President’s agenda that Trump is going to the rapidest possible number of states in the season of electoral campaigns,” said Reuters the Vice-President of the Trump campaign, who did not want to mention his name.
Tonight's campaign event, scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, can be brought to the attention of the supporters of "Ohios and Pennsylvania" and also to be reflected in the Pittsburg media," said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time that Trump visits West Virginia during the last month. This is a state where he received more than 40 percent of the voters' votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has been conducting a series of questionnaires.
“For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president has come to stimulate his results,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, reported Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team is nervous to compete, keeping hope high in front of Sunday's lonely games
After three unilateral sessions, the games that took place on Saturday afternoon were sometimes just what Ryder Cup needed.
A variable turning point on the pendant is a completely fictional concept in sport, but players believe in it truly, especially in competitions like this one.
So where do they think it's a turning point right now?
“They led six points, which have now become four, so I think I can view this as a small way of turning point,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, it is clear, because four points are being run and 12 points are still in play.
According to Spieth, the Americans feel that they have not enough wind to sail, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomase, who played together throughout the day and each got three points from four.
Spieth has been a foot injury both in the case of tii and grin and shows an example.
These cheers became ever more and more guarded by each round, concealing a determining tube that would have led to the fourth match after he and Thomas were in the ground with two.
His bag, which won the match on 15th, sent a similar cry that showed a man's faith that Americans are not yet out of the race.
“You just have to play more focused and worry about your match,” Spieth said.
It's the only thing the players can do.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players with more points after the last two days than Spieth and Thomas have on Ryder Cup's undisputed stars in Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
European odd but loved couple are four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit bugey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding bugey's on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back on nine Friday mornings.
This game and the way in which their energy flows into both a gloomy crowd, when it comes back, strengthens the view that players with whom they compete on Sunday, and that when the sun sets over Le Golf National, it is not possible to confirm Europe's victory as Fleetwood or Molinari.
As preferred, both at the same time in different holes.
However, we are talking about Europe's glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did Sergio Garcia, with a four-ball hero this morning, a quick job when a man was put in a couple of Alex Noren.
Bogey and two twice the first nine dug the Spanish and the Swedish into such a deep hole that they had no hope of digging out of it.
But on Saturday, there's no one who can help you out.
Four-balls and parsley games are extremely closely linked to looking at the relationship between couples, advice to each other, advice left unanswered and how the way can change in a moment.
Europe has been playing better as a team so far, and by the last day it has come to lead a strong country of progress, but this fourth session has shown that the US team has a problem with the nerves that have some, especially Americans.
Europe is to lead Ryder Cup on the last day of 10-6
Europe will be able to make good progress on the last day of Ryder Cup, following four-balls on Saturdays and a few games before the United States of America 10-6.
The great duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were led by two winners in trouble in front of Tiger Woods to raise their current score to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European Party, who contributed two years ago to the maintenance of the lost cassette, ruled after the failure of the American side in the morning in four-ball, winning a series of 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in a couple of games, winning two games, but they couldn't make up for the deficit.
Jim Furyki's side needs eight points from Sunday 12 individual games to preserve the casket.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. Together with Molinari, who has been called Molliwood after this weekend, they are the second couple who have won four points in the history of Ryder Cup in their fourth opening game.
After destroying the four-ball Woods and Patrick Reed, they continued in the same spirit by subjugating Woods and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeauveel more firmly: 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed random shine, but now lost his 29 four-balls and a pair of 19, becoming seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested himself for the morning four-balls, returned with partner Henrik Stenson to a match, winning 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who is the first and third place in the world order.
Europe did not succeed, although the competition was considered to be pleasant and windy south of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a firm victory in four-ball 2-1 over Spanish Jon Rahmi and Ian Poulter, returning later and winning a match between Poulter and Rory McIllroyd 4-3, losing two openings.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, the team has come back from a four-point deficit, going to individual games, although the owner needs only a sign to preserve Furyk's side of the pack.
While two days on the other side, after Sunday’s counterattack, it appears they will not succeed.
North Korea says that ‘no matter’ they do not engage unilaterally in lack of confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN on Saturday that the ongoing restrictions on their distrust against the United States and that the State would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
At the annual meeting of the World Organisation Ri Yong Ho said that during the last year North Korea has taken “a marked welcome action”, such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, the destruction of nuclear sites and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see the United States answering it," he said.
"The United States has no security-security in our country without our trust, and in such circumstances we do not agree unilaterally to put ourselves in the first arms alone."
While Ri repeated the familiar complaints made by North Korea regarding the Washington opposition to a "serious" approach to nuclear-free, on the basis of which North Korea is being rewarded when it comes to step-by-step actions, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject unilateral non-proliferation, as Pjongjang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump between the President of the United States of America and the North Korean leader at the Singapore Summit on 12 June, when Kim promised to move towards a "welcome of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea has requested the official end of the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to relaxing the strict international restrictions on North Korea.
"The United States calls for the "first nuclear weapons" and increases the pressure of restrictions in order to achieve their goal forcefully, even in response to the declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
“ Note that the restrictions are pushing us on our knees, is a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that the restrictions continue to deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader of this week stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: "If the issue of nuclear weapons was one of the parties to South Korea and not the USA, the issue of nuclear weapons of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock."
However, the speech of Ri was suddenly different from that of last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that addressing North Korea's missiles to the United States continent was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim's suicide mission "the rocketman".
This year, North Korea has approved the complete destruction of the threatened Trump in the United Nations for Kim's courage to take steps towards non-armament, but added that there is still a lot to do and that the restrictions must remain valid until North Korea has abandoned its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not have a timetable for this, saying: “It will take two years, three years, or five months — it is not important.”
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should pay for the measures taken by Pjongjang.
At the same time, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The enforcement of the Security Council's restrictions must continue forcefully and unswervingly until we can fully and permanently confirm the termination of the nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions applicable to North Korea by trying to prevent the financing of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Riga next to the UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
After a meeting with Pyongyang in July, he said that progress had been made since North Korea had only been condemned for a few hours after “gangsterical demands”.
That month, North Korea allowed the missiles and nuclear complex to be demolished by the United States of America to implement "comparative measures" at its meeting with Moon.
He said that Kim had told him that under "comparative measures", Trump was referring to the security guarantees allowed in Singapore and to the movement towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to relax enough
This year, Harvard University offers a new course where students need to sleep more in order to combat a growing aggressive culture, where they learn by means of overnight learning marathons in caffeine.
Students who love the academics of the world’s best university are often helpless when it comes to the basic principles of self-care.
According to Professor Charles Czeisler, who is a medical expert at Harvard Medical School and Brigham, and Professor Charles Czeisler of Women's Hospital, this is the first of his own kind in the USA.
He inspired the creation of a course after he gave a talk on how sleep problems affect learning.
"A girl came to me at the end of this, and asked, "Why not just now, in my last school year?"
He said that no one ever told him the significance of the dream - it made me sick," he explained to Telegraph.
The course, which came first this year, will explain to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting outcomes and will also help improve their overall well-being.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Head of Health at the University Paul Barreira said that the university decided to take a course course plan after it was found that the students were in serious sleep during the week.
An hourly course includes a number of counter-active tasks.
In one section a picture is presented. There students can click on coffee levels, curtains, sports footwear and books and explain the effects of caffeine and light on the impact of sleeplessness on sporting results and the importance of the habit of sleeping.
The second section explains how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
The university city map, along with the counteractive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily custom.
“We know that this does not change students’ behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," Professor Czeisler added.
According to him, night - learning marathons are still proud, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure for students means that sleeplessness is still a growing problem.
"The guarantee of a high quality sleep should be the student's "salarms" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety," he added. "This helps even against weight gain, as sleep lack makes the brain hunger, making man constantly hungry."
19-year-old chemical and physical biology student, Raymond So, from California, helped Professor Czeisler to set up a course, having attended one of his classes last year, in his first Harvard year.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to help create a university-wide course.
As a next step, he wants all graduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competition authority.
Professor Czeisler advised students to make alarm clocks both to sleep and to wake up, and to be aware of the adverse effects of electronic screens and LED lighting on “Blue Light” as this could damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga gate down Gerardi's men
The Rangers suffered another poor guest game result when Dolly Menga was hit by Steven Gerrard, who was sent by the side, brought 1-0 victory to Livingston.
Ibrox side hoped to have his first guest victory since February when 4-1 St Johnstone was defeated, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerard's second loss in 18 games as a leader, remaining eight points away from Ladbrokes Premiership's leadership in Hearts.
Menga hit her gate seven minutes before the half-time and the poor Rangers couldn't even recover from it.
The Rangers will therefore fall to the sixth position, Livingston will rise to the third position, remaining on Himernian with only one gate.
For the Rangers, problems may not be over yet, because their assaulter, Calum Spence, needed a head wound after he was probably hit by an object.
Gerrard made eight changes on the side that passed Ayri and Betfred Cup's semi-final.
But Holt went on at the same time with the same Liv 11 who took a point from Hearst last week and would have been happy with how his well-trained boys suffocated their opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers may have been much more dominant, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have hit the gate in the second opening minutes, when Menga first sent Scott Pittman through the Allan McGregor gate, but the halfback didn't take advantage of his chance.
The deep Keaghan Jacobs release was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but its defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide-ranging blow in the back of the post.
The Rangers did get control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Moreelos felt confident that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless met with 15 minutes of play, Judge Steven Thomson did not satisfy Columbia's player's complaint.
In the first half of the time, the Rangers managed to make a target only two hits, but the former Ibrox gatekeeper Liam Kelly did not have any concerns about Lassana Coulibally's top belt or the Ovie Ejaria event.
Although Livi's 34th-minute opening might have broken the rules of the game, no one can deny that they earned it purely because of their performances.
Once again, the Rangers couldn't control Jacobs' deep, heavy performance.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher set up a ball for Scott Robinson, who kept his peace and selected Men, who just took the plan to the end.
Gerrard acted during the break, switching to Coulibaly Ryan Kent, and this exchange cost almost no more than the end of the game when Morelos was divided, but impressive Kelly was feeding her to prevent her from being there.
But Livingston continued to attract guests to play exactly the type of game that suits them where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
The Holt side could have promoted his leadership at the end, but McGregor stood firm to stop Jacobs before Lithgow hit a big corner.
The Vice-President of Rangers, Glenn Middleton, once again, applied for a penalty when he and Jacobs went up, which Thomson never satisfied again.
Almanahh: Geiger counter inventor
And now the page of our Sunday Morning Almanahhist: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago and LONDADES ... the day in Germany was born the future natural John Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger counter.
Since the beginning of this science, Geiger’s counter also became a pop culture platform, as in the 1950 film “Coronado Watches”, where the main parts were apparently unlikely scientists from cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What else is this thing?"
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
With these earphones, you can hear the nucleus of the atoms separated from the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: “Don’t tell me, it's just going to get kicked!"
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention bearing his name lives on.
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system "seem" fraud cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach and kill the immune system "seem" of the peturs.
Vaccination teaches the immune system to know about fraud cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing their cells in the laboratory
Then they can “see” in common for many cancers, and they are injected back.
The study vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system how to detect petur cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient; these cells are changed in the laboratory so that they can receive the “face” protein that is common in the various HER2 cancers and then injected back into the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, explained: “Our results show that we have a highly promising vaccine.”
HER2 “directs growth of many types of cancer”, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach has been used to treat certain types of leukaemia in patients taking immune cells and teaching to target cancer cells.

You will receive the Saturday Night Live studio arrived in a flawed flaw towards Kanye West, after his mixed speech, in which he approved the United States President Donald Trump and announced his application to the same post in 2020.
After that night in his third song, which was named Ghost Town and where he was wearing a hat letter from Make America Great, he started to play the same against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“I have spoken so much to white people who ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he is a race? ’
“If I were so concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the device with Matt Damon, where Hollywood's fame made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judges Committee regarding Christine Blasay Ford's alleged sexual violence.
Although this part of the mission did not go to the air, West's shocking cassettes were loaded into Chris Rock's social media.
It's not clear if Rock tried to take a look at West post.
He also complained to the public of West that he was having quite a hard time with his hat behind the scenes.
“They mocked me behind the stage.
They said I wouldn't go in there, hat in my head.
They mocked me!
And then they say I'm drowned in the place," he said according to Washington Examer.
West continued: “You want to see a drowned place? I put on my Superman’s baby, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love."
According to Variety, a person stated: “All the studio was a dead end.”
West had been introduced to replace Ariana Grande at the last minute because the singer's former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West was amazed by the many songs “I Love it” which he looked like a bottle of Perrier at the time of his presentation.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who said: “To a brave soul, IT IS ACCESSED TO WRITTEN."
But the host, Karen Hunter, found that West was simply “the one who he is, and it is absolutely wonderful.”
“But I decided to reward MITTE (for buying music or clothing or supporting his “art”) someone who, in my opinion, believes and distributes a harmful world view to my community.
He's free.
Like us, he added.
Before the broadcast, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "former Kanye West."
He's not the first singer to change his performer's name following Diddy, who's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg has entered the name Snoop Lion and, of course, newly created musical legend Prince, who made his name a symbol.
The attempted murder in the setting-up of the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with a murder attempt after another man was stabbed on Friday at a restaurant in the east of Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
It is expected that the defendant will appear before the Belfast magistrate court on Monday.
The prosecution will be examined by the public prosecutor.
The fame of the Tron game Kit Harington does not approve masculinity of the approval
Kit Harington is well known for his sword’s flashing role in Jon Snowina HBO’s violent medieval fantasy game.
But an actor (31) drops down an aggressive hero stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen often mean that young boys often feel that they have to be harsh.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that "some things have gone wrong" and raised the question of how to solve the problem of masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Troon game with Rose Leslie (31) admitted that she felt "seriously" that this problem needed attention.
“I personally feel quite strongly right now that we have gone wrong somewhere with masculinity,” he said.
"What have we taught men when they grow up about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that the increase in the masculinity of the shield is partly responsible for television as it shows supermanic findings.
He continued: “What is incarcerated, and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they have to be just as men as they want to be.
I think this is really one of the biggest questions of our time - how do you change it?
Because obviously something has gone wrong for young men."
In his interview, he also admitted that after the end of the series, he would never participate in any Troon game, saying that he was “on the other side of his battlefields and horses”.
Since November, Kit Sam Shepard is part of the re-establishment of True West, which is about the story of a filmmaker and his looting brother.
The actor recently announced that he considered meeting his wife Rose the best thing about the Troon game.
“I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” she said.
Rose played with Emmy in the award-winning fantasy of Ygrette, Kit's performance by Jon Snow.
A couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of HIV and AIDS citizens has grown to 14%.
Health care professionals say that more than 820 000 people suffer from this disease.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have come from sex, changing the past.
Infrequently, HIV spread by blood transfusions in some parts of China .
In this way, however, the number of people infected with HIV had fallen to almost zero, confirmed by Chinese health officials at the Yunnan convention.
Over the years, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100 000 people in China.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is alleged to be high.
Because of the country's pre-age values, studies show that 70-90% of men having sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many transfers of diseases are related to insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has allowed general access to HIV medicines to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leaking of GOP senator's data, saying that it's "hazardal lies" and "conspiration theories".
The American representative, Maxine Waters, condemned the claims on Saturday that his employee had posted personal data from three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages.
Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are disseminated by the "ultra-paremist" trolls and their websites.
“The lies, the lies, and the more despicable lies,” said Waters in his Twitter statement.
The published information allegedly contained home addresses and telephone numbers of the US senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both Utahis).
The information was published on the Internet on Thursday. It had been posted by an unknown person at Captain Hill during the hearing of the Senate Panel regarding the allegations of sexual immorality against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Old-fashioned websites such as Gateway Pund and RedState reported that the IP address, which identified the source of the post, was related to Waters' office and issued member information by Hill.
“This unjustified argument is complete and absolute,” continued Waters.
‘My employees, whose personality, personal data and safety are threatened by these fraud and false claims, are not in any way liable for this report.
This unwarranted claim is a complete and irrefutable lie."
Waters’ statement was quickly evaluated on the Internet, including the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is due to anger,” wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that he has feelings that are not appropriate to his member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of something they haven't done, they can't get angry.
They can't be trolling.
They must not question the defendant's motives.
They must remain calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare the Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
The Republican candidate, Omar Navarro, also applied to Waters during the interim elections, expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It must have been true," he said.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned “the authorities concerned with regard to their fraudulent claims.”
"We all do this in order to identify criminals," he continued, "and that they should be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Film Johnny English Strikes Again overview - Understood Rowan Atkinson spy paro
At present, it is common practice to look for Brext in all new British films, and it seems to be particularly appropriate in Johnny English’s Parodia series, which began with Johnny English in 2003, and received a sequence of Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Is it humorous to make fun of yourself on the subject, how obviously stupid are we in the country's new export opportunity?
In any case, Johnny, who is inconclusive with a pony-eyed rubber look, has been allowed to do things again in his hand-to-face manner - and that this broad comic creation is intended for non-English cinematic territories.
Of course it's a secret agent who, despite his strange pretentious smooth-glam, reminds me of Clouseau, a little bit of Mr Bean and a little character who gave a tone to Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It is also based on the story of the traveler and international mysterious Atkinson, who was once played in forgotten Barclaycard television advertisements, leaving nothing but chaos.
There is only one or two pleasant moments in this last J.E. film.
I liked the approach to Johnny English helicopter when he was wearing medieval iron knights and helicopter wings for a second, he'd be agitated against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent to make a physical comedy, but humor seems to be less important and strange, especially as "serious" spy films such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves offer a comedy.
It seems that this humor is more intended for children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's schemes are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's dark films Beanina.
Today, it is always an actual assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber hacker has entered the UK's highly classified spy web network, exposing the personalities of all British secret police officers, thereby creating great disappointment to the agent on the ground - a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw blow for the Prime Minister, who is a festive and intimidating character, who suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does this Teresa-May performance excellently, but the manuscript does not have much to do with it.
His intelligence advisors suggest that, since all active spies are threatened, he must call back someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a school teacher in a proud institution, giving secret lessons about how to be a secret agent: here are a few good places where English offers a school of Rock-type spy school.
English is to be returned to Whitehall for extraordinary information and reunited with his former long-term partner Bough, who is playing Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to the captain of the submarine, where actor Vicki Pepperdine's talents have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, his Majesty's secret service, are again on the move, meeting Olga Kurõgyenko's beautiful femme fantale Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling into the hands of a charismatic tech-marider, and he claims he can solve all British computer trouble: the unhappy Jason Volta, who plays Jake Lacy.
The English and Bough begin with their thirsty odyssey: hiding themselves as performers, putting them on the fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos, keeping secret Volta’s luxury hunting on board; and English launches genuine fragility when he tries to use the main set of virtual reality to get to know the interior of the former house.
There are no brakes in this last section, but there is a TV set on the whole thing.
Pretty central stuff.
And as for other Johnny English movies, I thought: does the British film industry really not have a role to play for Rowan Atkinson that would be fair to his talent?
The working party denies the preparation of a plan where the British work four days a week, but they are paid five days ago.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has considered a turning plan that provides that the British work four days a week, but they are paid five days ago.
The party wants the company's superiors to pass on savings from the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to workers, giving them one additional day off.
That would give the staff a three-day weekend, but they'd get the same salary.
According to the source, this idea would be appropriate to the party's economic agenda, and so the country will be inclined to lean for the benefit of the workers.
The Thursday working week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress so that workers can take advantage of a changing economy.
The work party source told The Sunday Times: “It is said that the review of the draft will be announced before the end of the year.
“This is not happening overnight, but the Thursday work week is an attempt that is compatible with the party’s approach to balance the economy for both workers and the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The working party is not the first to support such ideas, as the Green Party allowed four-day work week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this effort is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
He announced: “The 24th working week is not a party policy and it is not discussed by the party.”
Ascendant John McDonald used the Labour Conference last week to specify his vision of a socialist turn in the economy.
McDonald said he's decided to take back power from the "visited leaders" and "loss-services" of communion companies.
The Azeksler's plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not recover all their participation, as the Labour Party could make "fearing" in relation to a senseable misdemeanor.
He confirmed his plan to place employees in company boards and to create inclusive equity funds to give 10% of private sector enterprises’ equity to employees instead of providing annual bonuses up to EUR 561,65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are on the show "60 Mines" as to whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can change their mind.
The investigation of charges brought by the FBI against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the application to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the findings of the Bureau could affect the termination of the support of the Republican senators.
In your Sunday interview, you will be asked by Scott Pelley, Co-Chairman of the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could reveal anything that might make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Fightly," said Kennedy.
“I said to go to the interrogation. I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, sure and clear."
The sound of Graham seems to be on a rock line.
"I am sure in my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it could only be changed in the bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know how it happened, but I know Brett denied it forcefully," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasay Ford.
“And everyone he has appointed could not confirm it.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new coming."
What is the global citizens' festival Global Citize Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York Global Citize Festival is organized by the annual music event, which has a hugely impressive participation in the hearings and the same impressive goal: losing poverty from the world.
Now, for the seventh time, Global Civil Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Law not only enjoying singers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the real purpose of the event, which is ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Civil Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. It is an international group of lawyers who hope to end poverty, continuously increasing the number of people fighting it.
In order to obtain a free ticket (unless you wish to pay for the VIP ticket), the concert farmers had to carry out several tasks or voluntary activities, send an e-mail to one of the world leaders, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal of losing poverty.
But how successful has Global Citize been if it has been another 12 years to achieve these goals?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert is a real way to convince them to act, or is it just another click, where people feel that they're doing something important by signing a statement on the Internet or stifling?
Since 2011, Global Citize has registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, seeking to achieve a number of different objectives.
According to this, these measures have helped world leaders to inform more than $37 billion of commitments and policies that affect more than 2.25 billion lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and the notification resulting from their activities and of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or financed.
The group assesses that the guaranteed funds have so far been directly affected by around 649 million people worldwide.
Some key commitments include the UK's partnership between investors and implementations The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to "helping out all the capacities of children", allowing Rwanda to give 35 million dollars to help stop malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 voicings from Global Citizens.
“With support from the UK Government, donors, national governments and global citizens, such as you, we can make an historic footnote to the social injustice of malpractice,” said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the people of London during the concert in April 2018.
The Group also announced that after more than 5000 activities in the UK, which called for the improvement of mothers and children's nutrition, the government announced from the financing project The Power of Nutrition, which reaches 5 million women and children in need of nutrition intervention.
In response to a KKK on its website, which asks, "What makes you think we can stop extreme poverty?"
Global Citize replied: “This is a long and difficult way - sometimes we fall and fail.
However, as we are faced with large civil rights and anti-parthenid movements, we are confident that we will succeed because together we will be more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Week, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is just a few performers coming up at this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the "truck" of the Navy to prevent Russia's energy exports - Minister for the Interior
According to Washington Examer, Washington may use its marine forces if necessary to avoid the hit of the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, has been published by U.S. Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia's participation in Syria, especially if it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is an excuse for the investigation of new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to exchange energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the South European stomach,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
"The United States of America has the opportunity to ensure that shipping lines are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he added.
Zinke's statement was turned on to the participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance of Consumer Energy, which is a non-profit society, which is the voice of the US energy consumer.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, indicating that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice of Iran and Russia is more or less, leverage and fuel replacement," he said, referring to Russia as "one trick pony", whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when Trump's government is responsible for increasing exports of natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to reject the "incoherent" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said turned Berlin into "serious".
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised that Nord Stream 2 pipeline of USD 11 billion, which doubles the power of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kreml claims that Washington's acute response to the project has simply been driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure disclosure tool and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” said Alexandr Novak, Russian Minister of Energy at the meeting in Moscow in September, with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry.
The US's stand has come back from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Labour Union (BDI) called for the USA to stay away from EU energy policy and from the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a major problem with a third country’s intervention in our energy supply,” said the German Industry Union (BDI) President Dieter Kempf after the recent meeting of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering candidate for presidentship in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that he would seriously consider running for president during the interim elections.
The Massachusetts in Holyoke's Raamats confirmed Warren's decision to apply for his application.
“It is time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, and it also covers the first leak,” said The Hill.
"From November 6th, I seriously consider running for president."
Warren also assessed the activities of President Donald Trump, saying that he “will take the country in the wrong direction.
"I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has published criticism for Trump and its High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Friday, Warren: "We really need the FBI before we vote."
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own voters do not think that it should apply for 2020.
According to the study of the political research centre at Suffolk University/Boston Globe, 58% of the 'serious' voters in Massachusetts thought that the senator should not apply.
32% supported this kind of application.
The survey showed more support for the former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, 38% supported a possible candidate and 48% opposed it.
Other high profile Democratic names discussed in relation to potential candidates for 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said it was officially decided by January, Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quote Donald Trump at the gathering Track Palin PTSD
Track Palin (26) spent the year recruiting from Iraqi September.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and charged with assault.
“What my son lives through, what he experiences when he returns, I can associate myself with other families who feel the consequences and wounds of PTSD with which our soldiers return,” he told the audience Donald Trump at the gathering in Tulsa Ohamas.
Palin called his son's arrest in a "advantage room" and said regarding his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little differently, they come back a little bit, and they come back to prison, and they wonder if there is enough respect for what has been given to soldiers and pilots and all other military forces."
According to Dan Bennet, on Monday he was arrested in Wasillas, Alaska, and the police officer of Wasillas, he was accused of domestic violence against women, domestic violence in intervention and possession of a weapon in a drunk state.
18 States and the Columbia region challenge a new asylum policy
Eighteen countries and the Columbia region support the legal challenge for a new US policy that bans asylum for victims who escape from gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday, 18 representatives of the countries and the region submitted a brief statement of friends in Washington to support the prosecutive policy of asylum seeker, the NBC News announced.
The full name of the applicant, Grace v. Sessions, was not published in August by the Union for Citizens' Freedoms against Union policy.
She said she was abused by her fellow “and her violent gang members” but the U.S. officials refused to accept her asylum application on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
National lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries producing a large number of asylum seekers in the US, including gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy changed the decision of the appeal board for immigrants in 2014, which allowed immigrants without documents to file asylum applications to escape domestic violence.
On Friday, Karl Racine, Prime Prosecutor of the Columbia Region, said that the new policy "will not go beyond national, Union and international law for decades".
"The federal law requires all asylum applications to be resolved in accordance with certain facts and circumstances of the application, and this requirement violates this principle," stood in the brief statement of friends.
In a brief statement, the lawyers also claimed that the ban on the entry of immigrants would harm the US economy, saying that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they would "require for the necessary workforce".
In June, High Prosecutor Jeff Sessions told immigration courts no longer to give asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
“The request for asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or political opinion,” said Sessions in their Communication of 11 June.
The purpose of the asylum was never to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day.
Mindful rescue operations in Palus where deaths have doubled in the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more threatening.
“The situation is very tense,” said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fever in the evacuation center of the town of Palu, who had a baby boy.
“A new people will arrive with an ambulance every minute.
There's not enough clean water."
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed homes by sorting over-crazed things and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by 7.5-magnite earthquakes were overburdened.
Some injured, including broken back and upper arms, broke Dwi Haris rested outside the Palu army hospital, where patients were still being treated under external conditions due to strong postpartums.
The tears filled his eyes when he recalled the strength of the earthquake shaking his fifth floor hotel room, which he shared with his husband and daughter.
“It was time to save yourself.
I think I was pushed against the wall in ruins," said Haris Associated Press, adding that his family had come to a wedding.
“ I heard my wife screaming for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they're not in danger."
The ambassador in the United States blames China for "agitating with antiquity commercials"
A week after the US official newspaper published four paged advertisements under the US daily news regarding the mutual benefit of trade in China, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the Annex paid by China Daily in Des Moines Register - Iowa with the largest tiara in the newspaper - after China was accused of an intervention in the US Congress elections on 6 November, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to intervene in the US elections marked what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in Washington's expansion campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war where each other's import tariffs are adjusted.
China’s countermeasures at the beginning of the tariff war were intended to catch exporters from States like Iowa because they supported the parties of the Trump Republic, the experts in China and the USA have explained.
The United States Ambassador in China and former Governor Iowa, as well as the largest exporter of agricultural products, Terry Branstad, said that Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and companies.
Branstad wrote in his Sunday Des Moines Register article: “China has now doubled its temptation by publishing a citational ads in our free press.”
“In the dissemination of its own propaganda, the Chinese government uses American expensive freedom of speech and free press practice, putting its paid advertising in Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
“In contrast, there are only limited votes in the street street in Beijing and there are no truly different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic direction of China, given that the media is at the firm hands of the Communist Party in China,” he added.
He added that one of the most outstanding newspapers in China refused to publish his article, but he did not say which newspaper was the case.
Analysts warn that the Republicans transfer female electors before the interim elections with Kavanaugh's fiasco
While many Republicans are waiting and defending the High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, accused of multiple sexual assaults, analysts have warned that they will see a setback during the upcoming interim elections, especially women.
The feelings surrounding the situation have been in the ceiling, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to go on voting.
These things cannot be taken back," said Professor Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School, which belongs to the University of Syracuse, on Saturday, in the article The Hill published.
Reeher expressed doubt that the last minute attempt made by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) regarding the FBI investigation is sufficient to calm the haters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget it tomorrow or November,” said the senior advisor of the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, and national representative Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC according to the newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protestors repeated the demonstration of “Novman is coming” in the Senate corridor, as the Republicans, who control the judges’ committees, decided to go forward with Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite Dr Christine Blasay Ford’s testimony, announced Mik.
"Democratic ind and internal water flow will be excluded from the schedule," said the informal political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the newsesade.
“ Human beings say it is already high, it is true.
But it may be higher, especially among female voters in the suburban area and younger voters aged 18-29 who do not like and often fail to vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which described his allegations of sexual assault against the Chancellor of the Supreme Court, analysts predicted a setback when the Republicans moved on with confirmation.
“It has become very confusing for GOP,” said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the National Committee of the Republicans at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the Commission, the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed, but also about how the Republicans have handled it and how they have treated it," led Guy Cecil's attention to the news channel in the Priorities of the USA (a group that will help to choose the Democrats).
However, Americans seem to be slightly divided, believing in Ford and who Kavanaugh, but slightly more by supporting the first.
The new survey of YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were sure or likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said that they certainly or likely believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought Kavanaugh was likely or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30% thought of the same Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is investigating Ford's claims and at least one of the other charges against Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford swore before the Senate Judges Committee that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that a candidate of the Supreme Court showed him his sex organs when they attended a party during their studies at Yale in 1980.
The World Wide Web inventor intends to start a new Internet that will stick to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, launched a start company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the Technology Commissioner Inrupt is a company that builds up Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
It allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have been given access to the information.
In exceptional interviews to Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal was to "world governance".
"We need to do this now," he said about the start company.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their "personal online database" or POD.
It may include contact lists, task lists, calendars, collections and other personal and competent tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which is all available in one browser and simultaneously.
Its personal online database makes it unique for the user to choose who can access this information.
This is referred to by the company as "to give individual powers through data".
According to John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to bring sources, processes and relevant skills to help Solidi make it available to everyone.
Currently, it consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project under the contract, and a community of volunteers.
From this week on, technology developers worldwide can create their decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team would not talk to “Facebook and Google, whether to introduce a complete change when all their business models are fully supported overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
On Saturday, Medium published in the post, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt aims to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solidi."
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the context of the neutral debate on the network.
Even on the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee World Wide Web Consortia, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute will become founder and director.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The spiritual Memorial of Victoria, crucified in World War I, was opened
During World War I alone, the English Church of Victoria, baptized in Victoria, celebrated its 100th anniversary in its hometown.
Lieutenant General Reverend Bernard Vann fought out his badge on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
But he died four days later, after the sniper shot, and he didn't know that he had received the highest mark of the British army.
His two grandsons opened a memorial in Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it would be “geniously symbolic” if the stone was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his Battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentini “by a very thick ball of fog japs and bullets.
Later, he rushed to the line of attack and carried it on with the “largest Gala ” before he rushed to one of the shooters alone, and three of the opponents were stunned.
Lieutenant General Vanni killed a German sniper on October 4, 1918, when the end of the war had only remained a little more than a month.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather’s actions were “anything I know I can never repeat, but for which I always remain grateful.”
She and her brother, Dr. James Vann, put a coat after the parade led by a young band called Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that he is “very honoured to participate in this parade” and added that“the presence and support of many people shows that the true hero is being assessed.”
The MMA fans were Bellator 206 all night long, but only saw Peppa in the Põrsa.
Imagine you've been up all night looking at the Bellator 206, but you're not even showing this basic event.
The San Jose match included 13 fights, including six basic cards, and it was shown on the UK Channel 5 directly throughout the night.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald made each other sit in the chest, the UK viewers kept their mouths on their screen.
Many were not impressed, especially those who remained awake until early hours to see this battle.
One of the fans described the transition to children's comics on Twitter as "a bad joke".
“It is a government regulation that at 6:00, the content was no longer appropriate and had to be switched to the children’s program,” explained Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President of Bellator on marketing and communication issues when asked about the transfer.
"The Holy Peppa", yes."
Bellator President Scott Coker said that they intend to work on their schedule in order to take more into account the UK viewers in the future.
“If I think about the replay now, I think we can solve this problem in the future,” said Coker.
“But if it’s 6 o’clock in the morning, we can’t do it until our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was modified, there were many texts back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical alarm.
But it wasn't, it was government rule.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
Instead of six fights, we show a reference - as we usually do - we tried to offer the fans more and we just went over time.
It's a serious situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low value" in relation to sexuality.
Tom Daley, the Olympic fighter, says that he grew up feeling that he was inferior to others because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old young man said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "one isn't like him."
By participating in Lauren Laverne Radio 4 on Desert Island Discovery, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others hope.
Being a parent also changed his attitude toward winning the Olympic Games, giving him the feeling that it was no longer so important.
You will receive your usual long-term escort, Kirsty Young, due to your illness, had to take a few months off.
In Laverine's first show, Dale said that he felt less valuable when he grew up than others, because it was not socially acceptable when you liked boys and girls.
He said: “Until today, these feelings are that I am not worthy and I feel different, gave me power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was worth anything, and he didn't let anyone else down when they finally found out about sexuality.
A two-time pronx-olympic winner has become a highly valued leader of the LGBT campaign, using its appearance in the People's Community Games this year in Australia to turn to more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he was talking about it because he was lucky he could live without consequences and he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - film artist Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "supervised him as a surprise."
Dale got married last year to his 20-year-old Oscar winner, but he said that the difference between age has never been a problem.
“When you were young so much,” he went to his first Olympic Games when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later – then it was hard to find someone the same old who had experienced similar rises and swords.
A couple became parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "all-seek" had changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
“But you know, there are much more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold has Robbie."
His son received his name after his father Robert, who died from 40 years of age in 2011.
Daley said that his father did not agree to die and one of the last things he asked for was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that "Dad, you can't sit in the front row, because by the time you're gone," he said.
“I kept his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually stopped breathing and died, I finally admitted that he was not undefeated,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a pronx.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of the home crowd at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling about it,” he said.
It also inspired her first song selection - Heather Small - which helped her prepare the Olympic Games and still makes her chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The form outside of Mickelson was removed from the game on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to improve his form to avoid unhappy verstaposts.
Mickelson, who plays record 12 times every two years, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's match and four-balls.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as he has often been for the US, the five-time winner divided his day into two, being an incentiveer and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct hitter, not even his career at the peak, is not suitable for 48-year-old especially to play a narrow Le Golf National Golf Course, where the long hard track punishs constantly a misguided hit.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will be facing his ninth race with the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four contests this week.
If Americans, who are behind four points at the beginning of the 12 individual games, start with fire, the Mickelson competition may be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he had not had much more to add.
"He fully understood his part today, put me on the shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder, and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk added.
“He is very confident.
He's a celebrity and he's given our teams as much in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more than that, but it went like this, and we had to choose a way like this.
He wants to be out like everyone else."
Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record on Sunday as the most part of Ryder Cup's games.
It may celebrate the end of his Ryder Cup career, which, however, has never responded to his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 lost and seven weeks, but Furyk said that his presence has given the team an additional spiritual contribution.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he likes to have fun with people and he's just great in the crew room," he explained.
“ I think younger players had fun this week, and it was nice to see it.
He offers a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great country of success will soon be lost
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that the great leadership of Ryder Cup in the last day of individual games can easily become an unpleasant experience.
The Danish entered the public at the 1997 Valderrama, where five-point advantage countries were held before the Americans with Captain Seve Ballesteros, but over the finish line it had been dramatically reduced, only winning was obtained with a result of 141⁄2 : 131⁄2.
“You’ll even think that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had great success in Brookline, where we lost and Valderrama, where we won, came this victory very close,” said Bjorn after the picture was won in Class of 2018 : 3 Friday and yesterday with success 10 : 6 Le Golf Nationals.
So history shows me and the whole team that it can happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points.
We have the goal of winning the chalice, and so let us focus on it.
I've always said, I'm focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we're very aware of who our opponents are, the best players in the world."
With satisfaction in the way his players have played this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I will not rush into things.
Tomorrow is a whole new obstacle.
Tomorrow you'll be reading your personal favors, and so it'll be something else.
It's nice to be with the opponent when things go well, but if you're there personally, you'll be tested completely as a golfer.
It's a message you have to send to the players. Give us the best of your time tomorrow.
Now that you leave your partner behind, he's got to go and take care of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes that his players will act better personally than his opponents, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both in these last few days, being part of Brookline’s victory before becoming part of his loss when Europe was under the influence of “Medinah’s miracle”.
“I remember every goddamn word,” he said in response to the question of how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put all their games on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you must start with fire, like in Brookline and like in Medinah.
When the stroke goes in one direction, it puts great pressure on the average competitions.
We set up our team accordingly and put the boys on the field in a way that we feel that it can be a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to run the competition and he's the best match with Rory McIllroy, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmi, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the best Europeans in the competition.
“I put my boys in this order because I think that we are properly covered,” said Bjorn of the choice of individual games.
Germany's new warship was delayed again
The German Navy's latest high-speed sail should have been in place in 2014, replacing the obsolete cold warships, but this will not happen before the next year due to the flawed systems and the increased costs of snowball, the local media reported.
The introduction of the new High-Rheinland-Pfalzi High-Sleeves in Baden-Wuertmber has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 according to the military press release published in Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy already in 2014, but the concerns of post-transmission problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
Four ships of Baden-Wuertmbergi class, ordered by the Navy in 2007, replace the ageing Bremen class high-speed sails.
It is understandable that they have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some concealing technologies such as radar, infrared and hearing signals.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest high-speed sails should be possible from home for up to two years.
However, long delays mean that high-level warships, which allow Germany to strengthen power abroad, are already getting old at service.
The failed F125 fast sailer appeared on the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time that the Navy sent the ship back to the shipowner after it was received.
The reasons for the return were little known, but the German media quoted a number of important "software and hardware deficiencies" that made the warship inoperable if they were used in a combat mission.
The lack of software was particularly important, since the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a team of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of the older Bremen class high-speed sails.
It was also found that the ship is significantly overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the ability of the Navy to add future innovations.
The 7000 tonnes ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ is probably twice the same class of ships used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to the flawed hardware, the entire project price, including the training of the team, becomes a problem.
It has been said that this will amount to EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) - compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of the latest high-speed sails will become particularly important in the light of recent warnings, according to which the capacity of the German Navy will decrease.
At the beginning of the year, the Chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, Hans-Peter Bartels, acknowledged that the Navy had actually ‘ run out of suitable vessels’.
The official said that this issue had grown as a snowball over time, because old ships were removed, but no replacement ships came.
He regretted that none of Baden-Wuertmängi's high-speed sails could join the Navy.
National Trust is investigating bats' secret life
A new study in the mountainous region of Scotland is designed to reveal how bats use the landscape to find their food.
It is hoped that the results will give new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future protective measures.
In the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross, Scotland's National Trust research monitors normal and sopranipples, as well as the bride's long-sleeves and Daubenton bat.
Special recordings shall be placed in the main areas of the area to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers also carry out field studies using hand-held sensors.
The competent assessment of all tapes shall determine the frequency and type of bats' call.
A habitat map and report will then be set up to create a detailed landscape image of their behaviour.
NTS Nature Advisory Rob Dewar expects results to show what habitats are the most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information helps to determine the usefulness of the management of habitats, such as the creation of crops and the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
In Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom, the death of bats has decreased considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects their habitats and their losses.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flying paper and chemical treatment of some building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting, their ears are more useful in catching prey than their eyes.
They use complicated echo-place techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
More than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land are very serious about bats.
They have ten trained experts who carry out regular studies, surveys, and sometimes save.
Even in the territory of the first and only special bovine herd in Scotland, Threave and Galloways, the organization has created eight out of the ten types of bovine herds in Scotland.
Real estate manager David Thompson says that this area is the perfect territory for them.
"InThreave we have a big area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees, and a great place to live.
But there is still much to be discovered about bats, so the work we do here and in other areas will help us to understand better what they need."
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before starting maintenance activities, as the unintended destruction of one place of zinc and birth can kill up to 400 mothers and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected and the killing, harassment or destruction of them is illegal.
Officer Elisabeth Ferrell of the Scottish Peace Union has encouraged the public to contribute.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our bats and we just don’t know many of our species and how their deaths feed.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while the lawyers plan to sue the German press.
Cristiano Ronaldo has rejected the charges of rape against him as a "public reform", saying that people "will want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue charges issued by the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus have been accused of rape in Las Vegas's hotel room with Kathryn Mayor in 2009.
He has allegedly paid EUR 330 643,10 to women, so that this incident would not be reported on Friday, Der Spiegel.
As the Instagram live video turned to its 142 million monitors for hours after the accusation, Ronaldo (33) reported that it was 'public reforms'.
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today it's a false news," said five times for Ballon d'Or's winner's news.
They want to promote themselves by my name.
It's common.
They want to be famous by my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," added the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to refer Der Spiegel to the Court for "a declaration of unauthorized suspicion of privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player is seeking compensation for “a moral damage that corresponds to the difficulty of an infringement, which is likely to be one of the most difficult violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged event occurred in a suite in Palms Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas in June 2009.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayor allegedly went back to the player's hotel room, where he claimed to be raped on the basis of the documents provided by the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged case and told him that he was “99 percent good man” of whom he “one percent is wrong.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed a couple of sexual relations, but it was not unanimous.
Mayor also claims that he went to the police and took photos of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial solution because he was afraid of "handling" and was concerned about "public cuts".
Now, the 34-year-old woman says that she is now trying to reverse the solution, as the alleged case continues to trauma her.
Ronando had left Manchester United during the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Italy for a giant Juve of EUR 100 million.
Brext: The United Nations may regret the leaving of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom ‘two for ever’, if it lost its position as head of the world automotive industry after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that the Tokyo UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily suspend its production at the factory near Derby in Burnaston.
"We have a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of border crossing stops without the Brexit agreement could be paid for jobs.
The Burnasto plant, where vehicles were manufactured in Tokyo Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that, when Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see the stop of the production process in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Burnastani Tokyo.
Other UK car manufacturers have also feared leaving the EU without agreement, having been concerned about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford after Brexit for one month.
The main concerns of car manufacturers relate to the risks of the supply chain in the absence of Brexit agreement.
The Tokyo production line operates as required, where spare parts come from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement of 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border which, according to industry, may result in delays and a lack of parts.
Toyota would not be able to keep more than one day's supply at its Derbyshire factory, so the production must therefore be stopped.
Clark said that the Theresa May Chequers plan for future EU relations has been "extricably calibrated to avoid such controls at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best solution to enable what we want, and not only to make use of the current success, but to take advantage of the full opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4 on Today.
"The evidence, not only for Tokyo, but also for other producers, shows that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful package of supply chains."
Tokyo could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the long term, warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately pay jobs.
Peter Tsouvalar, a representative of the Union trade union who worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “From his own experience we know that when jobs disappear, they will not return.
The government spokesperson said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says White House
With Donald Trump's major contributions to the High Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, one more week may be postponed, as the fight against the highest candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House announced on Sunday.
Mr. Rosenstein will monitor the work of Special Commissioner Robert Mueller, who will investigate the interference of Russian elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the obstacle to the President's possible resolution of justice.
Does Trump fire the attorney general and thus threaten Mueller's independence? He's been making Washington famous for several months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times announced that Rosenstein discussed with Trump the use of listening devices and the possibility of removing President's 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein didn't confirm that.
But last Monday he went to the White House, reporting that he was going to resign.
Instead, on Thursday, a meeting with Trump was announced, who was then present at the UN in New York.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid getting involved with the interrogation of the Senate Judges Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasay Ford, both of them gave hours.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh by delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press rep Sarah Sanders showed up on Sunday at the news channel Fox News.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But let's look at it and keep the press informed, as always."
Some journalists would object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Chief Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of information was not the result of the disappointment of TV journalists, although he added: “I do not object to the fact that they have been disappointed.”
Then he suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
The President puts more questions and answers in the session than any president before him," he said, without adding evidence: "We've looked at these numbers."
Sanders confirmed, “If the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of this, and you've seen how we've been doing this in the last few weeks, so it's happening during the press conference, if you can talk to the President of the United States of America."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Solo's press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, before the gathering of journalists, he was on his way and sometimes with a strange look.
Minister of Health wrote to EU workers in NHS Scotland regarding the fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU workers working in Scotland NHS to express their gratitude and wish to arrive after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent his letter if less than six months have left the UK EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to covering the costs of EU citizens working in their public services with established status.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In summer, negotiations have continued on the return of the United Kingdom to the EU, heading towards the expected decisions in autumn.
However, the UK Government has also prepared for a possible non-contractual scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
Professionals from all over the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit our patients and communities.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie passed an emergency surgery after the main trauma
Christion Abercrombie, a supporter of Tennessee State Tigers, passed an extraordinary surgery after Saturday's main injury and defeat 31 : 27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, published by Tennessee Mike Organ.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the damage happened just before the half-time.
"He fell on his side and just collapsed," said Reed.
Coaches and medical professionals gave Abercrombie a oxygen while on the side before he was placed on the load frame was removed from the field for further inspection.
The Tennessee State official spoke to Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was completed.
Harris added that there are no details of the injury type/difference, and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the second year of red shirt, was in Tennessee State during her first season after she passed over from Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before leaving the game, which made 18 fights this season.
Foreign buyers must pay higher stamp charges when buying real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers must pay higher stamp fees when they buy real estate in the United Kingdom, using this extra money to help the homeless on the basis of new Tory plans.
This step will destroy Corby's effort to attract young voters
The stamp duty is taxed on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to create up to GBP 120 million per year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher rate of stamp tax if they buy real estate in the United Kingdom, using this extra money to help the homeless, the Theresa May announced today.
The movement is considered an attempt to destroy Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide them with affordable housing and target high-income people.
The stamp tax is taxed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, providing additional money for the government's desire to fight unemployment.
The premium, which is in addition to the current stamp fee, including higher levels that were introduced two years ago for purchases related to another home and development, may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this movement will create up to GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of purchased London's holdings belong to non-UK residents, which raise prices and make it difficult for first-time buyers to get on foot when purchasing housing.
Many of the country’s wealthy regions - especially capital - have become “cold cities” thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy will only arrive a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the temple tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high when they bought land but did not use it, and invited May to give up quotas for affordable homes in order to improve the "life-related shame" of Britain.
Corbyn has reported a cloudy reform of the residential economy, including rent control and the end of the persecution of innocent people.
It also wishes to give the councils greater powers to build new homes.
May said: “In the previous year, I promised that I would commit myself as Prime Minister to restoring the dream of Britain — that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live here, work and build life here.
At the same time, it is true that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies located abroad, are as easy to buy homes as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has become too far-reaching and harsh sleeping conditions are common reality."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to run Scotland"
The leader of Sunderlan, Jack Ross, says that his “the ultimate goal ” is to become the leader of Scotland at some point.
Scotland (42) welcomes the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, currently in League One third, with only 3 points behind.
He moved this summer to the stadium of Stadium of Light after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Masters League during the previous season.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to class B and it was limited," Ross told BBC Scotland about the sports sound.
“But I grew up with my father watching Scotland in Hampden, and it’s always something that has drawn me back.
But this is only a chance when I'm successful in managing the club."
Rossi's predecessors under the leadership of Sunderland have been Dick Advocate, David Moyas, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Head of Alloa Athletic says that he did not feel fear in front of such large and well-known names, having previously endured both in Barnsley and in Ipswich Town.
"It's a success for me right now that I can take this club to the Masters League."
Because of its structure and facilities, this club will undoubtedly belong to the Masters League," he said.
"At least, getting there is no easy task, but I can only see myself successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross has worked as a leader for only three years since he was former Deputy Director of Dumbarton and 15 months among Hears' senior staff.
He then helped Allaola recover from falling to level three and made St Mirren the lowest position winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he's more comfortable now than he was in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was a real crossroads," he recalled Allo's transposition.
“I actually believed that leadership was more suitable for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did it, got reasonable income and enjoyed some of the peaks.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things to be done every week.
I'm still trying to keep my job under pressure and pressure, but the management just seems better.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it, and I'm more comfortable now than ever before."

According to the survey, the best time for the surface is Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer heat has improved the turnover of pubs in British trouble, but more pressure has been put on restaurant chains.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, but restaurants had fallen by 4.8%.
These figures were prepared by CGA’s representative of the CGA’s commercial consulting company Peter Martin: “Better participation in World Championships than expected for sunshine and England meant that July was similar to June, when pubs’ turnover increased by 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants became even more difficult.
In June, 1.8% of the trade in reduced restaurants deteriorated further in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars were most successful, and restaurants are trying the least.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, although not as dramaticly as restaurantkeepers.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between heard pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, while food sales fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, an analyst of free time and hospitality, said: “These results are continuing the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The effects of weather and major social or sporting events remain the greatest factor in selling outside the domestic market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to fight, although the decrease in sales by 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year is particularly painful in addition to the current price pressure.
The long and hot summer would not have been able to come at a worse time for food business, and only time shows whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August are giving some essential relief."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of brand-related institutions.

One of the five children has secret social media accounts they hide from their parents.
The study has come to the conclusion that one of the five children, some of whom are 11 years old, has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 gymnasts found an increase in ‘vist Insta’ leaves
The news heightened the fear of postponing sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "basic account" to show their parents.
The study concluded that one of the five children, some of them, is only 11 years old, creates secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20 000 gymnasts found a marked increase in the “vist Insta” accounts (reference to the picture sharing page Instagram).
The news heightened the fear of postponing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "basic account" designed to show their parents and made them acceptable.
One of his 13 - year - old daughter's secret pages discovered that a teenager called to rape others.
The digital Awareness UK and the private school association Headmasters and Headistress" Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles and half of them recognised the existence of personal accounts.
Head of HMC Mike Buchanan said: “It is disturbing to see that so many teenagers are tempted to create accounts online where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the winner of the sportsman at the Scottish Athletics Board.
At the annual meeting of the Scottish Athletics Board, Eilidh Doyle was elected a non-executive leader of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most well-known light powerist in Scotland and Ian Beatie described it as a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience in the last decade.
“Eilidhi is respected everywhere in Scotland, the United Nations and other sports communities, and we are sure that the Scottish athletes will reap the benefits of inviting her leadership,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I wish to be the athletes' spokesperson, and I hope I can make a real contribution to Scotland's sport and contribute to its development."
The American who won the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games at 200 metres and 400 meters totaled four Olympics, and now often shares his opinion at BBC, could not walk after the transferor ischemic attack.
He wrote in Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that whether I'm going to recover and, to what extent, it's only time.
I've done some hard work, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and I've already done speed training!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
A breast pump advertising that compares women with cows divides the Internet into two
The breast pump company has shared the Internet with two leer advertisements, which compares with the milky mother’s milky cows.
According to stories, the world's first silent chest pump presentation was marked by a technology company dedicated to consumers, Elvie's ironic music video, to present the freedom that this new pump gives itself to mothers who want to live.
Four real mothers dance at a table filled with hay, and sing: “Yes, I will milk myself, but you will not see me on the tail” and “If you did not notice, these are not the udders, these are my breasts.”
Repeats the verse: "Pumpa, pump, feed the kids, pump, pump, fill the ladies with milk."
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page of the company has produced similar opinions online.
77 000 times looked at and thousands of comments from video viewers disagree; many of them say that it illuminates the tents of the dairy industry.
“The use of pets to promote this product was a very poor decision.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and give birth to milk, but the difference is that children are stolen from them during the days of birth," wrote one.
Elvie’s breast pump does not pump from the breast-feeding bra’s eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentator said: “Aromaticly tragic for both mother and child.
But why not use these children to promote a mother's breast pump?"
Someone added, "A totally impenetrable advertising."
Some of them are for advertising, and a woman thought the story was a great deal.
"Leian, this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one of those if I was still breast-feeding.
The pumping of milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but let's take it the way it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another comment commented: “It’s a fun promotion for mothers who pump at their workplaces or in their toilets and feel like cows.
This advertising does not praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they've all danced in bras with non-hearing pumps.
The campaign's idea is based on the statement that many women pumping milk from their breasts feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is completely quiet, no wires or tubes, and does not appear to be a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep children and even walk in the yard during pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserved a bold and annoying introduction.
We wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges in comparison to women's opportunities for expression and dairy cows, while presenting the extraordinary freedom that the new pump creates in the entertainment and familiar key.
It's not the first time the news has reflected the Elvis pump.
At London’s fashion week, the designer Marta Jakubowski, the mother of two children, delivered the product.
Thousands of migrants' children went quietly to Texas border tent camp
The number of children arrested has increased sharply, even though monthly crossings have remained quite the same, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policy of the Trump administrator has made it difficult for the children's start-up sponsors.
In general, most sponsors are immigrants with documents and they have been afraid to violate the possibility of continuing their country, so they require child care rights.
The risk increased in June when the national authorities reported that potential sponsors and other domestic adults could present fingerprints and data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior immigration and customs administration officer, admitted to Congress that the Agency arrested a dozen people who requested financial support for non-assisted minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of arresters had no criminal history.
“Approximately 80 percent of sponsors or sponsors’ household residents are illegally present in the country and a large number of them are of criminal background.
So let's keep tracking them," said Mr. Albence.
In order to deal more quickly with children, officials enacted new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest.
Many defend immigration before the judge by means of a videoconference, to come to the office.
Irresponsible for release shall be sent quickly out of the country.
According to the asylum staff, and based on the reports of the system published in recent months - the longer the child is in custody, the more likely they will become nervous or depressed, which may cause violent demonstrations or attempt to escape.
According to the Advocates, these concerns are more relevant in large detention facilities such as Turin, where the child’s difficulty in falling into trouble can remain between two eyes due to size.
They added that moving children to the tent city without leaving sufficient time to practice or say goodbye to friends could cause a trauma that many people are already in trouble.
Syria requires the immediate exit of the US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to come home at the UN General Assembly, even though the country has been at war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces on Syrian soil were unlawfully pretexted and dealt with accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally, he said in the Assembly.
Moualem claimed that the ‘war against terrorism’ of Syria was almost over. Since 2011, more than 360 000 people have died and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight "in this sacred war until we have cleaned the whole Syrian area", both from terrorist groups and from "any foreign power that is illegally present."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and consulting deaf entities and Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In France there are more than 1,000 troops in a country of war.
Speaking on the subject of war refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were appropriate and accused of inexplicable fears that prevent refugees from coming, spreading part of the Western countries.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help their neighbors," he said.
"They are politicians who are merely a humanitarian problem."
The United States of America and the European Union have warned against the fact that there is no end to war between reconstruction aid and Assad.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which will create an Idlib buffer for the last rebel base, has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Türg agreement prevented the widespread branch of the Syrian forces supported by Russia in three million provinces.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had “a clear deadline” and expressed the hope that military activities would be hit by the gangs, including the Nusra Front armed with Al-Qaedada, who would “be destroyed”.
As the United Nations Ambassador to Staffan de Mistura will soon expect the first meetings to convince the new members of government and opposition to plan the post-war Syrian Constitution and pave the way for election.
Moualem made demands for the Syrian Government to participate in the Committee, saying that the work of the panel could be limited to the review of the articles of the current Constitution and warned against intervention.
Why Trump will be elected for another term of office
According to this logic, Trump could win in the next elections in 2020 if his office and scandal had not completed his office before, as is likely to be desired by liberal viewers.
What should undoubtedly be “the most exciting ending of the President’s Office! ”
At present, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-hour ratings have doubled to over 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, the Fox Newsil peak hour has an average of 2.4 million viewers. Compared to the number of 1.7 million viewers in the last four years, MSNBC has increased.
“This is the tension that we are involved in because we do not understand it,” said ABC drama “Designed Survivor” Head of State Secretary, who will become president when the attack destroys Parliament’s building.
Nell Scovellil, who has experienced comedy writer and book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," author, is another theory.
He remembers the pre-election taxi ride in Boston.
The driver told him he was voting for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He said that he would make me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell to me.
All this chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, not like any other show on TV, Washington's famous stories can become fatal for Roe v Wade's future and reunite immigrants' families and the global economy.
Staying aside is merely the luxury of the viewers.
However, a six-hour discussion of Bob Woodward's "the basic background study" of his book "Fear" and Paul Manafort 13 225,73€ of the Janana Linnaha Bomber's jacket (Washington Post said about it as a "too much confidence in clothing"), and Stormy Daniels's backgrounds regarding the description of Mr Trump's anatomy magic, the viewer is more than a educated citizen.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario again with the same feeling.
“One of his activities, which may seem like a series of real life, is that he shares something every night,” said the CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the series Brent Montgomery Trump’s performance with the intermediate performers and day-to-day plans (to-day norming with NFL, Kim Jong-uni praise).
There's no way to leave a single eye between you or you're out of time.
This week at Fleiss, at his home on the northern shore of Kaai, he was 80 degrees warm, but he had fallen into the room to look at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't give up on how Brett Kavanaugh would deal with the Senate Legal Committee and how the fate of the Supreme Court hangs on his hair.
“I remember in our time doing all kinds of crazy shows and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” said Mr Fleiss.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

On the other hand, cash flows are moving to the highest White House intermediate selection.
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania will receive a cash flow thanks to the restructuring of the Congress Area, receiving two dominant companies at the same place.
As a result, Conor Lamb, the first number of the suburbs of Pittsburg Province, who won the place in the second division last spring during extraordinary elections, proved to be a re-election.
The opposite candidate for Lamb is Keith Rothfus, Republican, who is currently representing the 12th Division of Pennsylvania, which is over 17 new.
The maps were changed after January following the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and therefore the old districts were divided into anti-Constitutional electoral regions, favouring the Republicans.
The new 17th elections have triggered a campaign in which the financial departments of the largest political parties will be involved with money - the Democratic campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican campaign (NRTC).
Lamb became known as Pennsylvania after the button won a lot of viewed March 18th Congresses of Pennsylvania in extraordinary elections.
This is where the Republican took place several decades ago, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in division.
Political opinion speakers have given the Democrats a small advantage.
United States El Salvador was punished for supporting China and then withdrawn.
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing as a small setback to Washington.
Mr. Trump met with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in a friendly atmosphere in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw Trump out the corporate management team.
The Foreign Ministry officials decided to recall the American leaders of a diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, since Heather Nauert, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said earlier this month that these countries had not recently supported Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador was scheduled to be punished, who received 140 million dollars of aid from America in 2017, including drug surveillance, development and economic momentum.
The penalties proposed, including the reduction of financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American State and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During internal meetings, North American and Central American officials continued to hold a high-level meeting aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to leave a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a development effort to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, the high officials explained that they wanted to continue the consultation and to stop the debate on any of El Salvador's penalties.
According to the Diplomas, Vice-President Mike Pence is now being evaluated, who will speak during the mid-October meeting to speak about government positions.
And three American ambassadors returned secretly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without further notices or punishment from Washington.
The White House, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details spoken by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss national discussions at the request of an anonymous stay.
Their discussions were confirmed by a close analyst to the government who also spoke at the request of anonymity.
Study History
Next, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller will publish a report on Trump's possible jurisdiction, which has many evidence in the archives of the state.
Mueller is also alleged to examine whether Trump's campaign is linked to Russia's attack on our elections.
If Congress is to change the party, Trump will have to report back to this institution as he would speak to voters and perhaps even his peers.
There are many others here, and I do not want to point out that Trump and his colleagues in Europe are inevitable.
We all have to make a choice that will affect the duration of the fight on both sides of the Atlantic.
In 1938 German officials were prepared to turn against Hitler if only the West had prevented him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the following multi-year slaughters.
History moves around such turning points and the innumerable march of democracy is getting closer or delayed.
The Americans are now faced with a number of turning points.
What do we do when Trump fires the Deputy Prosecutor of Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been boiling in the water since it was announced that last year he made a proposal for a secret record of the President and was speculating that position over the impunity.
Rosenstein says The Times's statement is inaccurate.
“How to react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is neither complete nor fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of reliable accusations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, do we vote for Congress in the middle elections if Trump is to be held accountable?
If these tests fail, democracy will go on a long winter holiday.
But I believe we will not fail because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was picked up by the same Nazi regime as Auschwitz, who never took over and used our ambassador's home.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me the light of the candles on a table with a hammer.
With this legacy, how should I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the battle of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will arrange Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that you will win Australia, which, at the beginning of this month, followed by an impressive line against Villarreal in Spain, will place them in a strong position to become the European League Group G.
The knee injury did not allow the middle player Graham Dorrans from the first appearance of the season before 2 : 2 sign-out game against Villarreal, but believes that Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for better results.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a strong opponent,” said a 31-year-old player.
“We went to the game, believing that we could achieve something and left the game with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but it was usually a fair result.
They were better at the first half of the game and again in the second half of the game.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
I hope we get three points, but this will be a hard game because they got good results in their last game, but because people support us, I'm sure we can get together and get good results.
Last year was difficult, thanks to this, I was hurt and there were changes in the club, but now we all feel good inside.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can move on now, leave the previous season behind and be successful."
Women cannot sleep due to fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that the interviewers had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said that they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said he'd talked to his children about it.
"The people want family members to take care of them, but they are not talking about it," explained Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide's life insurance business.
This should, however, begin.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare to care for your family unless they know your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and family by discussing where and how to get care, as these options may be of utmost importance in relation to costs.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your adviser may have a good plan to pay for these costs.
Your funding options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance policy, hybrid financial life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or early self- insurance - as long as you have the necessary money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop any possible legal battles already in Eos.
Get yourself a health care mandate to identify a trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals will follow you at the time you wish if you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider also the trustee in relation to your financial support.
Choose a reliable person who would make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid even if you are powerless.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to respond to questions related to medicines and allergy?
Write these things down so you'll be ready if you have to.
“This is not only a financial side, it is also important for those who are doctors?" explained Martin.
‘What medicines are needed?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Put it all in place."

Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, former Governor of Alaska and Vice-President Sarah Palin's oldest son have been arrested for the attack.
According to the report published on Saturday in Alaska State Troopers, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, in connection with domestic violence suspicions, domestic violence-related intervention and opposition to arrest.
According to the police report, when a female person tried to inform the police about the alleged crimes, Palin took a phone from him.
The ball is held at the Mat-Su preliminary investigation facility and held against a $500 outstanding bail, KUU announced.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared that he “is no fault,” reported a news net.

In December 2017, he was accused of attacking father Todd Palin.
With regard to the alleged attack, the police called his mother Sarah Palin.
The case is currently being discussed in the Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of an attack at home, of domestic violence in intervention and possession of a weapon, all in a drunk state.

Federal prosecutors in NYC apply for a rare death penalty suspected of a terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors of New York apply for a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, killing eight people, and this rare punishment has not been committed for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) claimed to have used Home Depot's rental car to attack the bicycle route along the West Side roads in Lower Manhattan, making its way to both pedestrians and cyclists in October.
According to the request for a death penalty in the southern region of New York, prosecutors have to prove, for reasons of the death penalty, that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and caused serious injuries to the body.
In both cases, there is a potential death penalty on the basis of the case-law.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury filed a 22-point charge against the whole of Saipov, including eight murder charges, including blackmail, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "a strong planning and aspiration," said the prosecutors, describing the action of Saipov as "a blatant, cruel and depraved."
‘Sayfullo Habibullavivic Saipov caused injury, damage and damage to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco family and friends,’ stands in the intention.
Five victims were tourists in Argentina.
New York South District Court's last death procedure has been ten years.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but the outcome was that he was sentenced to life sentence in September 2009.
The last death penalty was committed in New York in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg's federal case, when two years ago the couple were executed in a conspiracy to carry out a spyage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an old usbekk, demonstrated the lack of regret in the days and months following the attack, according to the records of the case.
According to the police, he had told the investigators he'd been happy with what he'd done.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by an attack to take action on the ISIS videos he looked at on his phone.
According to the police, he also wanted an ISIS flag out in his hospital palace.
In a 22-point charge, he hasn't taken the blame.
David Patton, one of the national defenders in Saipov, said that they are clearly disappointed in the decision of proceedings.
"In our view, the death penalty decision is extended by Patton, instead of a life sentence without the option of being released, to all those affected".
Previously, the Saipov Defense Team asked prosecutors not to file a death penalty.
According to Mr Tory, NIGEL FAAGE should be appointed to lead the negotiations with Brexit.
Mr Farage, during the protest of the Tory Conference today, promised to "mobilise the People's Army".
The former UKIP leader said that the politicians had to "know the heat of the Eurosceptics", as one of the members of Theresa May's own parliament recommended to conduct negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a conservative member of the House of Lower House, said on the march of Birmingham, that UK would "be out by now" if Mr Farage were the secretary of Brexit.
However, Mrs May is facing the problem of reconciliation of her deeply divided lines, which were emphasised by the conservatives in favour of remaining, joining the city with their protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is in trouble with keeping his Chequers plan in the midst of the Brexists, icers and EU attacks.
The Allies insisted that it continue the transaction with Brussels despite the counterattack and force Eurosceptics and liberals to choose between their package and "loss".
Bone said, at the gathering of Leaves Leave in Solihull, that he wanted to "stop Chequers' plan".
He recommended that Farage be a partner and give him responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
'It's his responsibility that we'd be out by now,' he said.
A member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: "I stand outside for Brexit, but we must abandon Chequers' plan."
In reflecting on his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars in order to be subject.
We want to create our own laws on our own land."
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote now: “I believe that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is not true.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Tory Brext, was also on the march and told reporters: “Just one thing: Prime Minister, listen to people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and among our activists who actually walk the streets and choose us at all.
Please leave Chequers' plan and start listening."
He added: “The ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises."
Farage said that politicians at the gathering should be “a feeling of heat” when they plan to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class" he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let that happen."
He added to his enthusiastic audience: “I want you to put our political class at the edge of Brexit’s treason.
"We will mobilize the nation army of that country, which gave us a victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, municipal, proud Great Britain."
At the same time, the icers marched through Birmingham before the two-hour gathering at the center of the city.
The top-to-back activists used the "Tors Against Brexit" to play a series after the group was set up this weekend.
The Liberals Lord Adonis mocked conservatives on security issues that became part of their party's application when the conference opened.
"They are people who say that IT systems can be located and all the technology can lead to Canada and more to smooth border crossing, to cross-border trade in Ireland," he added.
"This is a complete farce.
A thing like a good Brex doesn't exist," he added.

Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the voters in the rave house after Trump took office.
The defendant asked if he was going to run for president.

The L.A. Police in Baton Rouge reported on Saturday that a suspect of the shooting of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims took place on Friday.

They released a video of a Friday shooting, asking for help to identify a man on the tapes.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University in the early morning of Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died behind it,” said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, through 247sport.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and got a bullet from Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, possession of a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Police Department.

Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after the team account gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From this moment on, it became clear that Valtter Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team sequence plays a major role in the race.
Bottas began well and left Hamilton almost unhappened when he first set up his position and asked Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first went to the boxing stops and left the Hamilton group behind in a tight traffic that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the box stop later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went after being in the neighborhood to lead when Ferrari's leader accidentally left the inner envelope to pass after the third deaf attempt to protect it with double tolerance.
Max Verstappen started the competition from behind the square line and was on the seventh for his 21st birthday at the end of the first round.
He then led the competition most of the time, driving the rubbers to the finish, and passing from Kimi Räikkönen, taking the fourth place.
He finally drove to the box stop on the 44th round, but he failed to increase the speed of the last eight rounds, which gave Räikkönen the fourth place.
Today is a difficult day because Valtter worked hard all week and was a real gentleman by the way to my children.
"The men have done excellent work to have one of the two," said Hamilton.
It was a very poor body language.
President Donald Trump accused Senator Dianne Feinstein of the incident during his Saturday gathering that he had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasay Ford, who accused the Supreme Court of calling Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
When speaking about the gathering of Western Virginia, the President did not address directly Ford's testimony to the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, but instead commented on what was happening at the moment in the Senate, which shows that people are “sons, disgustings and falses”.
“The only thing that can happen and is now what has happened in the Senate in a few days is that you see anger and anger, evil, disgusting and false people,” he said.
“When you look at press releases and leaks, on which they say: ‘ Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question: Did you leak the document? — Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he added with the look of the senator.
Ford sent a letter to Feinstein in July on Kavanaugh's charges and it was leaked early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his job.
The Hill stated: “I did not hide any charges of Dr. Ford and leaked his story,” he said to the Feinstein Committee.
"He asked me to keep my confidentiality, and he asked me to do so, too."
However, his denial was not appropriate for the president who commented during his Saturday gathering: “You know what, it was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's one of the worst body languages I've ever seen."
By continuing to protect the High Court candidate accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats use these charges for their own purpose.
“They have decided to take back the power without choosing the means.
You see this horror and disgustingness, and they don't care who they hurt, who they need to go over to get power and control," said the Mediat President.

The pilot dies to save hundreds of people from the earthquake
One Indonesian air traffic manager was declared heroic after he gave his life to ensure the safe take-off of hundreds of people.
The great earthquake on Friday’s island caused a tsunami that resulted in more than 800 deaths, many of whom were unknown.
The region's strong extremities, and many people are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that the 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled from the fluous airport at Sis Al Jufri Airport, he refused to leave.
He remained on a work mail to ensure that Batik Air Flight No 6321 was safe for take-off at the same time.
Then he jumped out of the flight tower, thinking it was gonna fall apart.
He died later at the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesperson Yohannes Sirai confirmed that his decision could save hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News.
We set up a helicopter to transport him from California to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died in the morning before the helicopter arrived at Palusse.
"We were extremely sad when we heard of it" added the pressman.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to thousands. According to the National Disasters Agency, access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the press representative of the Agency, said: “The number of deaths can rise, because the bodies of many victims are still under the ruins and have not been reached.”
The six-metre waves have destroyed the city of Palu, where mass destruction takes place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
The 35 - year - old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News, “The tour will bring new sacrifices every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesia Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we cannot tell you what they can find there.
It's already a tragedy, but the situation can get even worse."
The Indonesian President, Joko Widododo, arrived on the Sunday of Palus and said to the state military, “I ask you to work nights and days to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready for this?" CNN reported.
At the beginning of this year, Lomboki, Indonesia, was hit by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people.
According to Air Niugin, one man has disappeared since the Lownoon Air accident.
Although it has been said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from a floating plane, the air carrier in Micronesia now claims that one man has lost his plane in the Pacific lagoon.
Air Niugin said in his statement that since Saturday afternoon, they couldn't find a male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find a man.
The airline did not immediately answer the passenger details, such as questions about his age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane landed on the island of Chuuk at the airport.
The officials said on Friday, seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still present at the hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the precise chain of events are still unclear.
Both the air carrier and the United States Navy said that the plane landed far from the lagoon runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was going over the flight path.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was flying very low on landings.
"It's very good," said Jayes.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers were able to touch the floating plane in the waist water to the emergency exit.
He mentioned that the cabin crew had panicking and screaming and that he had a little head injury.
The U.S. Navy and sailors who worked on a nearby bank also helped rescue by using boats that were full of people to take them to the shore before the plane went down about 30 metres.
Air Safety Network data show that 111 people have died in aviation accidents involving PNG air carriers registered in the past two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
An analyst will draw up a timetable for the night the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the DPO closed the case for a man who was accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spent several hours as an expert observer in the analysis of intelligence data.
He told the jury how he used his mobile phone records to re-create the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements at night when she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he received location information from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night when she died, which was contrary to the earlier claims made by the young man.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, which is why the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford entered the courtroom on Saturday and admitted that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said that he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said that Tellis said, "she said because my car was in Nashville."
Another mismatch was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers before she died for about two weeks.
Phone records showed that women had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers died, Telles deleted the messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from her life," said Hale.
Protective action is planned to make your trial call on Sunday.
The judge said he thought the case would go to the jury in half of the day later.
The High Breed: What is known about hippo?
Hippo trio wants to fight with a negative genre definition by adding positive messages to music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hippo has removed its political messages and social problems from the beginnings of solving problems.
They want to go back to hippo roots and make the conscious hippo popular again.
The bands like The Fugees and Common have recently re-elected popularity in Britain thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
The New York babysitter complains about a racist message after a couple of courts.
New York’s babysitter sues for discriminatory dismissal a couple of times after an accidentally received message from his family, in which his mother complained that the nanny was “serious black".
Couples deny that they're racist, compared to blackmailing the situation.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her resentment when she learned that their new shooting service provider Giselle Maurice was black when he came to work for the first day in 2016.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband, saying: “EIIIIIIIII, SYRINGE MUSTANAHALINE.”
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, the discomfort of Plasco-Flaxman, after his professional understanding of Ms. Maurice, claimed that their social nanny who was African-American had done some bad work and had been waiting for the Philippines in his place.
Miss Maurice was paid one day ago and then sent home with Uber.
Now Maurice sues a couple of judges to obtain compensation for dismissal, which he wishes to receive on a daily basis for a daily amount of 350 dollars for the next six months, and the same work he was initially hired to do but without a contract.
"I want to show them that look, so do," he said to The Post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
A few have rejected the claim that they are racist, saying that the termination of employment with Maurice was a sensible thing because they were afraid that after she was insulted, they could no longer trust her.
“ My wife sent him something she didn’t mean.
He's not a race.
“We are not racist,” said the wife’s wife, Joel Plasco, in The Post.
“ How could you give your children to keep someone with whom you have been rude, even if it was unwitting?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Commenting on the comparison with blackmail, Plasco said that his wife was two months away from the birth and was "a very difficult situation".
“ Would you go against someone like that?
This is not very nice now," added the investment banker.
Although the case remains, the public opinion has quickly condemned a couple in social media, where they are severely considered because of their conduct and their thinking.
The new letter reveals that the Paddington publishers were afraid that the readers would not communicate with the talker.
Karen Jankel, daughter of Bond, who was born immediately after the book was adopted, said: “It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of a man who read it for the first time before publication.
It's very fun now to know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He said that his father, getting inspired to write a children's book about a small game, worked as a cameraman of the BBC, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work after optimism, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book was due to the death of his father with a mistletoe.
Regarding Paddington, whom he described as "very important member of our family", he added that his father was quietly proud of his final success.
“He was a quiet man enough, and he was not a proud man,” he said.
“But since Paddington was so real for him, it was how you feel when your child achieves something: you are proud of them, even though it is not your achievement directly.
I believe he was looking at Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always recognized himself as Peddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On the ground, his daughter was rushed to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“They called regularly, to say that her condition was very bad and that they do not believe she would survive,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperous.
“ After that, I received a call from Nadia, who said that my daughter will die in two minutes, and I must say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The medications that the doctors gave him to keep beating his heart had begun to disappear quietly and leave his body.
He was a little bit dead before that, and now all systems started to stop working.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay together."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperous, who now mourned his daughter, went on a plane with other passengers who didn't know anything about his experiences.
"No one knew that," he said.
“ I kept my head down, and tears flowed all this time.
It's hard to explain, but on this flight, I felt terrible compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Her postcards prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones working together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sticked cards on the Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Miss Davis' son, Tyler, was 13, when he suffered from depression, and he was 18 when he killed himself.
“I don’t want no parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
The 45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lydney, said that his son was a promising cook who had a contagious smile.
“ Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile would shine all the room."
Nevertheless, he stopped working before he died because he was "in a very bad place with his own."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm always worried it's got a domino effect."
Ms Davis created these cards “to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even with their friend.
Don't shut up – you have to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Miss Davis for years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t say that he was feeling bad or depressed or anything,” he said.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at the lowest point of his first Christmas — when the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
Ms Humphreys said that the man’s death was a terrible trauma to them, but they have to deal with it: “It will tear the wound into the entire family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we have to move on and continue the fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on his hair while the FBI starts his investigation
“I believed that if we could actually have something that he wanted – a study of limited time and scope – we might be able to achieve unity,” said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Committee would “be able to meet” in the middle of the permanent concentration of the Partisans.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate it?
Their resistance was due to timing.
The interim elections will only be in five weeks, November 6, if the Republicans do not expect to do well, they will be greatly weakened in their intentions to get the best of the world's highest court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone to call the senators by lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits his report?
The vote will take place at the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently present.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice-President Mike Pence to give a decisive vote and to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea's troops is "losing" under Kimi's government
South Korea's regulation has said that the number of North Korean troops to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-sug, quoted South Korea's data on the consolidation of South Korea, said that compared to the 2011 troops (2706), their number decreased last year (1127).
Mr Park said that the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a larger number of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of North WMDs have been offered South Korea citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most escapes through China, which has the longest country limit with North Korea, and which is easier to overcome than a heavily protected demilitarised area between Korea.
China, as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, often sends troops back to the country with force.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically in war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the abolition of nuclear weapons.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-uni in Singapore, where they generally allowed them to work towards the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho the United States accused the United States of no progress in sanctions.
"Untrustful United States of America, our country has no security and, in such circumstances, we do not agree in any way to become unilaterally first armed," said Mr Ri in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosis called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that the man was not a judge of the Supreme Court.
The opposition director of the Chamber of Governors, Nancy Pelosi, appointed Judge-General Brett Kavanaugh as “hysterical” and said that the man was temperatively ineligible to work as Judge of the Supreme Court.
The game delivered an opinion on Saturday's interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
“I saw inevitably that if a woman had been present in this way, she would have been called hysterical,” said Pelos on her reaction regarding the testimony given to the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday of Kavanaugh.
Kavanaugh had emotionally denied that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasay Ford when both teenagers were.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening speech, describing his family and his high school years, and he almost screamed at times and was sometimes out of his mouth.
He also explicitly condemned the members of the Democratic Party in the Committee, calling the accusation against him on the loss of Presidential elections in Hillary Clinton in 2016 as an organized and coordinated killing of angry liberals.
According to Pelos, he believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that the man was not suitable for judge of the Supreme Court, since it showed that he had been deported against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
The game remained modest when he was asked if he was to try to withdraw him from office when Kavanaugh was confirmed, if the Democrats were to receive a majority at the Board of Governors.
"I say so much – if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he doesn't fit not only as judge of the Supreme Court, but he doesn't fit in the court where he is currently working," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now the judge of the Court of Appeal of the Columbia District.
He added that he was concerned, as a Democrat, about decisions against the Affordable Care Act (health Act – Translation Note) or Roe v Wade (Abort’s statutory Advocate General – translator’s Note) as a conservative judge.
At his approval, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would withdraw some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It is not the time when a hysterical calculated person could become a judge and wait for us to say that it is not nice,” said Pelosi.
And women have to wear it.
It's a fair choice of words, a rising anger over the months and years, and it can't get away with it.
“We cry when we get angry,” said Ms Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
He continued: “I received help from a woman who was a leader somewhere; he said that she cried also when she was angry, but she worked out a method that stood up to her when she became angry and started crying, she told a person with whom she was talking to, saying to whom she might say, ‘ You may think I cry because I am sad.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are partially accepted as an output of rage, as they are considered to be fundamentalally wrong.
One of my brightest memories is one of the early jobs in the majority of men's office, where I once found myself in the unspeakable rage crying when one older woman — a strict leader I had always been a little afraid of — took me from the collar and carried me to the stairwell.
"Don't ever show them crying," he told me.
“They don’t know you’re furious.
They think you're sad and that gives them satisfaction."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic Party Congressman in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in the men's presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart got caught on board a monkey Business hunt with an extra-marital love story and ended the campaign, Schroeder was deeply upset that there was no reason why he should not think of running for president himself.
“It was not a well - designed decision, ” he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates, and the last thing they needed was someone else joining."
Someone said it's like, "The Snow White and the seven thumb boys."
Since the campaign was running out, he was late to raise money, and he promised not to apply if he didn't get two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, gave him only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a benefit?" he thought.
When he gave a speech, when he announced that he would not launch the official campaign, his feelings became so grateful to the people who supported him, he was agitated against the system that made it difficult for him to turn to the voters instead of the money and the delegates, and his hatred for sexistism — he was so overcome that he had tears in his throat.
"You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," said Schroeder's press reaction to him.
“I should have thought that Kleinex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking about what they're writing on my gravestone.
"He cried?"
How the U.S. trade war can be of benefit to Beijing
The openings of the U.S. trade war between the US and China were curative, and although the battle is far from over, experts say that the inter-state gap can be useful for Beijing in the long term.
This year, President of the United States of America, Donald Trump made the first warning mark, imposing taxes on important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important evolution this week was the introduction of new tariffs for USD 200 million (EUR 150 million) per dollar, which essentially impose taxes on the parties from China to the United States.
Beijing has always answered the same thing, placing the last $60 billion in US goods with tariffs of between 5 and 10 %.
China has promised the United States that it will be allowed to respond to the wound, and the second largest economy in the world will probably not look so soon.
Getting back to Washington would mean giving up on demands, but public worship to the US would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that, if Beijing's maps are correct, trade war with the US can support China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that cause the loss of control over the economy in another country is, in fact, far more dangerous than the Witnesses have previously acknowledged,” said researcher Abigail Grace, who focuses on researching Asia in the think room Center for New American Security.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is ready to return refugees
According to Syria, the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls on the country to rebuild after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country would improve.
"The situation is more stable and secure in the country's territory thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to restore the regions destroyed by terrorists to bring back normality.
There are now all the conditions that refugees who have left the country on a voluntary basis because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting daily life and living.
According to the United Nations forecast, 5,5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the beginning of the war.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be pleased to accept aid to build a country that was a desolate.
At the same time, he stressed that the state would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the resurrection.
Europe won Ryder’s Cup Competitions in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup competitions in 2018 by lowering France near Paris at Le Golf National golf course with the final score of 16.5 vs 10.5.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won Ryder's Karks in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team received the 14.5 points necessary to win the United States.
Throughout the tournament, Phil Mickelson was a star in the United States on the par-3 track of 16 waters, giving victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was shining in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have won the tournament in the current 1979 format as a result of 5 : 0 : 0.
For the American Jordan Spieth, the result was 5&4 removed from the lowest Danish Thorbjorn Olesen on the European team.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, promoted Ian Poulter from 2 and 1 in English, to whom it could have been Ryder's cup competition last.
Eight of Ryder's truck race veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European student of all time.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the chalice back.
It is a team spirit, and I am glad that I was able to help," said the emotional Garcia for Europe's victory.
He's going to pass the hit on to Jon Rahm, the co-man, who won the US golf star Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
“I feel extremely proud that I won Tiger Woods — when I looked up to him,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his fights in France, and now he has written a career in Ryder's truck race result 13 : 21 : 3.
Strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who's won 14 titles of major competitions, leaving only Jack Nicklaus behind.
The U.S. team was a team of fairways throughout the weekend; by way of exception, Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
The US captain Jim Furyk said after the team was disappointed: “I’m proud of the guys, they were grim.
In the morning, there was a time when we put pressure on Europeans.
We fought them.
Cut off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players did a very good job.
Let's get together. I'm working with America's PGA and our Ryder Cups Committee, and we're going on.
I love them 12 guys, and I feel proud to be their captain.
We've got to get the hat up.
We were better played."
New information on water pollution: decreased concentration in Pinelaes, Manatees and Sarasotas
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Living Nature Commission (FWC) shows a general reduction in the concentration of flourishing algae in the Gulf region of Tampa.
According to FWC, there are reports of a more dynamic flower in the regions of Pinellase, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which refers to reduced concentrations.
The waters have a range of about 130 miles (209 km) from the coast to the southern part of the county of Lee.
