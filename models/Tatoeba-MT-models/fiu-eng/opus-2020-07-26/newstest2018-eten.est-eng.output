Four members of the Kemerovo Group were arrested in Estonia and Spain
According to the postman, the police captured the so-called Kemerovo Group leader, Slava Gulevitch, who is known as Slava Kemerovski in the world of crime.
The Gulevitch in Spain was arrested with the permission of the Court.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspected arrests in Estonia.
It is suspected that the so-called Kemerovo criminal association is members of the age of 27-57 who are mainly involved in drug offences.
In the province of Malaga in Spain, Mijas was captured by the alleged leader of the criminal community.
In Estonia, three men were suspected, one of which was collected according to the data, as well as two members of the criminal community.
The data collected indicate that in the Community of crime there were clearly shared tasks and roles.
The aim of the criminal community’s action was to commit drug offences and thereby earn criminal revenues", commented the Head of the pre-trial proceedings on the criminal case, Public Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not exclude the increasing circle of suspects in this criminal case," added the prosecutor.
It is people who have been involved in law enforcement orbs before, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the course of the investigation.
"International cooperation has become a standard for us, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation", commented Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said that the preliminary investigation of detentions took nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of this week, long-term work was realised, and at the same time, we held our suspicions of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
He added that officials of the Central Criminal Police were of help in detention in Spain.
For years we have a good relationship and understanding with the Spanish police and the civilian card force.
These detentions are another message to the criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information collected so far clearly indicates that, while being in freedom, suspected men may continue to commit new crimes, the prosecutor requested their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia.
In the context of this criminal case, real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
The criminal case pre-trial procedure is carried out by the Office for organised crime in the Central Criminal Police and led by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court condemned Slava Gulevitch and punished him with five years of imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevitch was considered to be a second man in the Estonian crime scene after Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevitch, from Kemerovos, rose in the Estonian Underworld in the early 1990s, when he began to deal with blackmail in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes who worked at various hotels and demanded monthly coverage from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscation of proceeds of crime and judgment in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the last of the judgments, the so-called Dikajevi accused of criminal offences, of which 8 000 euros were seized, or nine persons were sentenced to the fact that Igor Aleynikov set up a criminal community in 2006 aimed at the illicit trafficking of smugglers and the conduct of crimes related to trafficking in human beings in eastern Romania and South Estonia.
The consolidated criminal income is close to EUR 71 500.
In these criminal matters, success has been ensured that policemen exchange information with foreign colleagues every day and evidence from prosecutors and, if necessary, carry out operations in any country of the European Union.
The Civil Rights Group warns about travelling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advanced People (NACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The Group's statement states: "The NAACP travel note issued for the State of Massour, valid until 28 August 2017, calls on all African-American passengers, visitors and misourists to be particularly careful and extremely cautious when moving throughout the state, taking into account the total race-based race-based events that have recently taken place in the state and are also listed here."
According to NEACP, the group was encouraged to issue the recent Missouri Act, which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination, as well as the fact that the targets of state organisers are in a large proportion of minorities.
People's rights are violated.
They are drawn to the tea edge because of their color, they are beaten or killed," said NAACP Missouri branch President Rod Chapel to the newspaper The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had such close complaints before."
It is the first warning issued by an organisation for the state of the United States.
The group referred to events such as racist insults towards black students at Missouri University and Tennessee's 28-year-old Black Tory Sanders.
Sanders died in half of the suspicious circumstances of the beginning of this year after he was hit by a state-owned gas station and was arrested by Missouri's police without being accused of a crime.
In addition, the note refers to the recent report by Missouri's Attorney General, which shows that black drivers are being stopped in the state by 75% more likely than white men.
"It is meant for people to be aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues for what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"The people must be ready, whether it means taking bail money or informing their relatives that they're going through the state."
On the basis of the latest data from the FBI hate crime reporting programme, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, which, in terms of the number of similar offences in the state, will be placed in the state through 16 cuts.
The travel alert is also in response to the new law of Missouri, which makes it more difficult to sue a company in search of housing or work for discrimination.
The American Civil Freedom Community (American Civil Liberals Union ACLU) had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after those states adopted immigration laws which required local ability to arrest people for immigration violations, as ACLU said it would increase racist profiling.
Usually, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is issuing travel warnings for other countries, but recently interested groups have started to use this measure as a countermeasure to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: What can anyone know about the different forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis or inflammation of the liver may be caused by five different hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C, which may continue to develop into liver cirrhosis, or liver cortisol, and liver cancer, is at low cost.
Epidemiology adviser to the Health Department Kusar says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are similar in all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grey stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of skin and mucous membranes.
The last signs of liver inflammation are also known as yellowing.
In children, hepatitis may run without signs of disease.
The different species of inflammation of the liver can only be determined on the basis of data from a laboratory study.
Acute hepatitis can become chronic hepatitis and go for decades without signs of disease, meaning that a person may not know anything about his or her disease that affects the liver.
Kutsar Kutsar presents various forms of hepatitis and describes their course.
The hepatitis viruses spread from a sick person to a person and infect us when we eat contaminated food or drink water, by sex, from an infected person’s extremities to the hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, mouth, and drugs.
The risk group for hepatitis infection includes family members and carers of the sick child, people with chronic liver disease, people having an infected sex, men having sex with men, drug addicts, passengers visiting countries with high spread hepatitis A.
Vaccination can be prevented in vaccinations, in particular by recommending vaccination for many persons who are travelling and who are at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet the daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands, before eating for food, wash all fruit and vegetables.
The hepatitis B viruses spread when exposed to human blood, when injecting drugs, tattooing, Augusting, using blood contaminated olives (hambaharads, refining products), donor blood, sex with a hepatitis-like person, and mother of hepatitis/born.
B The risk group for hepatitis infection includes injecting drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health workers, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, and passengers visiting countries with high hepatitis B disease.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is recommended that people be vaccinated, particularly those at risk, and those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes should be vaccinated.
The other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: prevention of the use of foreign hygiene and manicure devices, other sharps and needles, tattooing and suspension of syringes and use of condoms in the event of sex at risk of infection or prevention of sexual risk.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan and free of charge for children in Estonia.
The hepatitis C viruses spread when exposed to human blood, when injecting drugs, tattooing, Augusting, using blood contaminated olives, donor blood, sexual sex with a hepatitis dubious person and from the mother of a hepatitis patient to the foetus/born.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting narcotics, infected human sex partners, men having sex with men, newborns with an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health workers, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, people with HIV infection, and passengers visiting countries with high hepatitis C.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: prevention of the use of foreign hygienic and manicure devices, other sharps and injection needles, tattoos and diluents and the use of condoms in the case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
D hepatitis D is caused by hepatitis D virus, which is reproduced in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection with hepatitis B or superinfectants is present in chronic hepatitis B patients.
D hepatitis viruses spread in contact with blood and other body fluids, infected syringe needles, sexually and rarely infected mother to the foetus.
D The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who are not immune to hepatitis B.
An effective prevention measure is vaccination against hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people against hepatitis D virus infection.
Hepatitis viruses are spread via the fecal oral route with drinking water and food, including low-cooked beef, fish and marine bears, donor blood, syringes used in combination and from infected mother to foetus.
Passengers may be infected with hepatitis E in countries with high disease.
Prevention measures for hepatitis are to satisfy hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after taking a toilet, before preparing and eating food, after care for the patient.
Fruit and vegetables wash before consumption, avoid eating low-cooked beef, fish and seaweeds, drink only safe drinking water and refrain from using drugs.
Although on the last round the competitors tried to pull the four-fold Olympic player off the track, the 34-year-old Farah found power at the end of the line and won by 26.49,51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling the track after the finish with him, accompanied by his wife, Tania, and children.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah said to journalists.
Farah is targeting the fifth title competition in London in a row of 5,000 and 10,000 meters of gold duubs running.
It's all possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connori "Daam in gold. Gustav Klimt’s Master’s Mastership, Adele Bloch-Bauer’s portrait is an extraordinary story" from the birth story of one art piece much deeper into the cultural life of the late 19th century and from the beginning of the 20th century.
But more in-depth with time.
It would have been useful for the information to be taken away, or the harder axe, the narrower the theme allowed in the title, to gain more effect on the extraordinary story of the portrait.
It would now be like two books: Gustav Klimt and the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer on his painting "Daam in gold" and a much more comprehensive and broad-ranging history of respected Jewish families and German occupations along with its consequences in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the cultural life of Vienna in the middle and who himself fell into the capital of Austria, can hardly imagine how more than a hundred years ago life went around Ringstra, or how everyone in Central cafe turned their heads when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe’s richest cities, and the book’s familiar name makes you feel like a grams more cultured.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where there was an inhospitable syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, as if there was nothing more to be done.
Or perhaps, however, each pair of platings adds colors to cultural life in Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century.
A dream of travelling to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had increased explosively, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost every tenth of Vienna's population was Jewish.
Adele's parents were newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele was married twice to Ferdinand Blochi and Klimt of the Czech Magnade for his famous paintings, his father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele didn't draw the whole glamour life she belonged to.
If you look at "Dam in gold", it's hard to believe that at the end of life this great lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his wife's portrait from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
The Klimt order at that time paid 4,000 kroons, a quarter of the price of a house with a good location.
The fact that some portraits were suspected of having a master's love story model, the magnamate did not throw down.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only solid fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist that developed during the work continued for the rest of his life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor.
Gustav Klimt’s Masters, Adele Bloch-Bueri portree extraordinary story", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Immediately before the start of the work, Adele had visited Ravennas San Vitale basil and researchers think that the brilliant masquerades of the masquerade from Theodora gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele in a painted mosaic wall.
Klimt presented his "Dam gold" in Vienna in 1908 and at about the same time (years 1907-1908) was born in another gold painting "Sucus".
Artistic historians did not miss the similarities of two women.
What about the story, Hitler?
"I think that as a reminder of my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his handiwork available to the public", Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, the Klimt had completed another portrait of Adele.
Also in his will (Adele left in February 1925), he asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four provinces of Gustav Klimt to Austria Gallery.
She gave her jewelry to her nieces Maria and Luis.
One year after Klimt had finished "Austrian Mona Lisa", he had tried to get to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but failed the drawing chamber.
Although Hitler’s later anti-Semitism is sometimes considered to be the cause of his failure by Jewish professors to accept him to the academy, none of his experiments were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of Austrian Gallery, referred to at Maria’s will, had changed considerably by 1939, and it had become important for Vienna’s rich Jewish collections of art to be found in Nazi parties.
Hitler’s personal art assets were also suitable for some work at Adele’s home, but not for Klimt’s.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year trial began between the Austrian government and the heirs of Bloch-Bauer.
It should be noted here that if "Sudust" sees in the castle of Belvedere in Vienna, then Adele Bloch-Bauer must be seen as a journey to Neue Galerie in New York.
And before we go to Vienna, to read the above book.
Even if you didn't go to Klimt's work to look at, because at least my emotions turned around more Nazi and Jewry after closing the book than a $135 million painting and model sold around Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So, not as much a portrait as a family fate story - and a very moving story.
The Bauer family tree at the beginning of the book made it easy for events to be oriented.
17-year-old swimmer was very close to Estonian records in Canada
In the mood, Gold was very close to the personal record of its 200 m of cell swimming 2.16.62.
Tipmark dates back to the 17-year-old bishop from the beginning of the week when Canada's jurisprudence competitions took place at 2.16,58.
Gold escaped last, or tenth, the A-line.
In the final he passed the discount with 2.15,76, and reached a good seventh place with a new powerful peak.
Alina Kendzior, Estonia's record (2.15,13) remained separate from Gold for just over half a second.
Gold rose to the third of all times in Estonia, and its fresh personal peak is the fifth result of all time in Estonia.
The young hope of the future is still taking place at Canada's Adult Championships in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m free-circuit and 200 m and 400 m in the complex.
Last week, at the Canadian Junior Championships in Toronto, Gold took on a successful start there.
He won 200 m in the loosening silver medal in time 2.03.22.
This was the last time that this distance was flooded by Estonians in 2008.
Throughout time, only Estonian record engineer Elina Partõka has swimd this distance in Estonia.
A Estonian living in Canada won another 100 m of the Pronksmedi with an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season peak mark 56.66.
For example, a year older Kertu Ly Alnak has swimd this distance only one century faster.
As he reached the personal peak, he reached 100 m in the opening of the announcement at 0.03,69 C.E.
In the longer distance of half, he reached only the seventh place when swimming in the final of 2.17,31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season chart on four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sterilizing teeth
It's time for vacations - that means relaxing the president of the United States to Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has been one of the most holiday days Presidents, critics are already feeding teeth.
According to the U.S. Today and CNN, the president's plan is to spend a 17-day vacation at a golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the President's leave started yesterday, Trump's opponents have already spoken on holiday for a week.
They're giving Trump too frequent rest.
It's called the president's custom to spend a weekend in his villa in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days of office.
For example, George W. Bush had already been on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama was half less than Trump, but only 21 days.
But Trump's going to have a quick dream.
The number of days after Trump was president said, "60 minutes", that there would be no time for long rest in his abyss, because there is so much to be done.
He also published three years ago a grudge on Barack Obama's vacation.
The current president wrote on Twitter: "When Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending parties and jazz concerts, the ISIS journalists will cut their heads off."
According to White House officials, a 17-day golf club visit is not exactly a relaxing one.
It is officially called a leave of work during which Trump does not have time for reading or other activities of mind.
In addition, employment leave had to have another reason.
The White House's Western conditioning system will be replaced, and therefore the entire staff had to leave.
There are also Ovalkabine in the west wing and other office premises of the President.
"I don't think any of you would want to be in the west wing in August if there are 38 degrees and no condition," said White House speaker Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the President would continue working on vacation.
From where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you'll get a clue about the video.
Blocking criticisms from Facebook Do not apply to the public administration if you do not tolerate the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew so much about the adverse media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the papers didn't take long to get him to get rid of everything from internal politics to political principles.
The criticism, of course, upset him.
But he didn't make his critics shut up.
Because in 1783 Washington said that " freedom of speech can be taken away from us, and in dark and quiet, we could be led to sheep-like slaughters".
It brings me to Larry Hogan, Governor Maryland, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted at least 450 people's posts, who published their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And at the beginning of the week, the American Alliance of Civil Freedom (American Civil Liberals Union ACLU) appealed to him for this reason.
The Governor's official identified the action as empty, and the online commissions were colluded by counter-reactions in the style "Who cares?".
"It's only Facebook," said many.
But that matters.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an amazingly popular Republican governor in a democratic state.
His acceptance percentage is better than the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan's not a mind-responsive smokin' head.
He has led the State with a firm hand and remains strictly determined of his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool for communicating with his voters rather blatantly, presenting, for example, the first time after chemotherapy, his bald head.
Thus, the governor’s page, which is a public forum with official marking, manages the unnecessary and ultimately dangerous blockage of people visiting people who receive wages from taxpayers’ dollars.
In Hogan's press officer Amelia Chase defended the conduct of the interview to the Washington Post, saying that blocking comments was nothing more than modulating.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of Internet trolls, rappers, or people full of anger.
The Post talked to a number of real people that Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they're real people who communicate with their elected leaders, teacher, company owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectable, well thought - out, and not ugly.
In his post, the pastor quoted the Bible by pressureing Hogan to Catholicism.
A lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, did not incite anger, but rather anger crimes.
"I politely explained that I was disappointed because he did not respond to hate crimes or to other recent news," he wrote The Post's news story in a commentary state.
"I also do not like the idea that the number of people commenting on the same subject, but some immediately call it an unintelligible collective effort rather than admitting that this is a great deal of concern to citizens."
What the Governors called "directed spam attack" would probably be called "public support".
Facebook time allows easy matching messages by blocking a review or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than old when workers came out to do the same, to collect and burn the newspapers with critical instructions, or arrest the protesters, and to make them shut up.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official to be criticised for the teething of Facebook and other social media.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who are blocked by Twitter's flow.
One of the first marked judgments on this subject was made last week in Virginia.
In Alexandria, the U.S. District Court, James C. Cacheris, decided that the chairman of the Loudouni County Supervisory Board, violated the first amendment to the Constitution when he blocked the electorate from his Facebook page.
Kentucky also visited ACLU Facebook and Twitter after using Governor Matt Bevini (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington’s time, affordable postal costs had a similar effect as on the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800 fourfold the number of newspapers and anonymous writers swept his direction.
And even then, Washington had to do it with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington’s decisions.
According to the historical documents collected in the framework of the project for the collection of online George Washington letters, he buried the cabinet under petitions which criticised his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't make them shut up.
Freedom of speech, differences and discussions are the foundation of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for comfort in the home territory of the Renaissance Club
The former European First Number Ronan Rafferty looks forward to comfort in home territory within the next three days, when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place at the Renassance Club’s golf courses.
The Northern Ireland, who was leading the last round of Archerfield Links in the neighbourhood last year, prior to Paul Eales' surrender, has been fond of the new venue and performs the role of the tournament ambassador instead of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we can see how the club, with this event, will shine fully," Rafferty said.
"The travelers see the track in their best form, it's in a brilliant state.
Jerry's been doing an excellent job setting up this place.
He's a zealous supporter of golf game and he's proud of what's achieved here.
This will make it possible to present the track perfectly."
In English Eales is looking forward to the first time to protect the championship, although the man has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"It sends a very special feeling," said the gamer in Southport.
"I couldn't protect my Extremadura Open's title because it was taken from my winning contest calendar a year later.
It's magical to come back to this place.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, and for me and my wife Sharon, it was special for last year's victory.
It was a very special time that we would always bear in our hearts."
Gary Orr, who joined the European tour of Seniors in Europe, will return to the competition again on the ground of the year when he received 50.
His first event in Scotland following his participation in Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"The home to play is always a little more meaningful," said Helensburg's man Orr.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel the extra effort.
I've had a huge pleasure in playing again and I've shown you a pretty decent golf game.
"I'm happy with the way things go."
Ian Woosnam, a winner of the former Masters tournament, and Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty, will join Trio.
Orr and former Ryder's chauffeur Captain Sam Torrance are two of the six warriors in the race, the rest of them are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entry is free of charge, and parking a car with one passenger costs 5 pounds and 10 pounds for two or more passengers.
All revenue goes to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death on a goldland in Indonesia
When Bartina makes dinner for Dege, she doesn't use a ticket.
He doesn't even use the pot.
In a wooden cabin in Enaroto, the province of Papuan, Indonesia, located in the capital of the province of Papua, the housewife places nota directly on a fire site in local language.
In half an hour, the burnt tuber will be taken from the fire and washed with unwashed hands into the skin.
Degei sits on the floor of the mud, has no furniture, and there she does her daily household work, such as washing her laundry with cloudy water from the nearby sex.
The train's role is filled with a bucket in a roofless room.
Since she is younger than four wives, she has not been assigned to care for any field.
Polygamia is common here.
However, working late can be dangerous for most village men who are unemployed, and many of them drink hard, and there are still soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5:00 a.m.," he says.
This is a rare look in life in the mountainous region of Papua. It is with the former Dutch colony, which was added to Indonesia under 1969 after a referendum in which only 1026 old people were forced to vote under the eyes of the occupied forces.
The movement of its rage against the Jakarta Government, which remains under strong control in the region, to keep away foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, so that the independent Papua New Guinea remained in the east of the island.
The Enarotali is equally a remote and abandoned place. To get here, you have to fly from Jayapara to Nabire for 90 minutes from the capital of the province and then make a five-hour journey to be taken by the rental car.
There is no common transport.
A city of about 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bambard blades and covering the waved iron roofs that the roses have transformed into yellow browns.
Very few Indonesians have taken their way here, not to mention journalists, nor have they been here at almost all foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, the Popes of Mee Pago worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing such clothes," says Degei, referring to the turban, dark shirt, and to the bright skirt in his color-created hand.
"before we carried it on the body only plant leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and the statistics on infant mortality and infertility are one of the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's goldy land.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province of about 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine in Grasberg, which belongs to Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015, Freeport only mined gold and copper for USD 3.1 billion from here.
In addition, Papua can be threatened with consumer timber, which is estimated at USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are the source of the sufferings of the pope, as they result in the stunned presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
The New York Times 2005 survey showed that Freeport paid local military and military units around USD 20 million, including USD 150 000 to one officer between 1998 and 2004.
The efforts of the popes to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and go wildly around them.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 popes have been killed since 1969 and thousands of other Indonesian military forces have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killing of genocide in the mountainous countries of Papuan tribes in the 1970s was the measure.
In the last year alone, over 3900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Indonesian police in the region.
The 2016 report of the Birsbane High Priest's "We will all lose" contains evidence of cruelty committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (in the second report, especially rape and electric shocks) and the brutal rejection of peaceful demonstrations.
"The number of students is difficult to read because such incidents take place every week," says Andreas Harsono, a researcher of Human Rights Watch Indonesia.
Kruvid is even more screwed up, as Papua’s natural resources have caused new residents’ influx from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the Province’s 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but demographics are changing because of the arrival of Muslim economic migrants from the population of Indonesia, Jaava, Kalimantan, Sumtra and Sulawes islands.
The Ja public's family cans sell gado-gados with chips and mixed vegetables, served with peanuts.
The locals can't fight them.
"Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local beans," explains Abeth You, born in Pania, who moved to Jayapura, the province capital for work.
"The papal-ma-ma-ma-a-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-
The Indonesian President, Joko Widododo, who is known among the people as Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to deal with the violations of their inequalities and human rights in Papua.
On his way to the Jakarta presidential palace, the former woodensmith won Papua 29 from the 29 electorate district, including Paniai.
But the Pope has very little changed, and the locals feel disappointed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014, we voted for Jokowi in the hope that he will fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," says You.
In fact, Pania suffered only two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotti sang on Christmas songs at the fire when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on the motorcycle.
The infected children told them to turn on the front lights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tabai, one of the soldiers was bound by their tone and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers were chasing children and beating them with their guns' handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot up children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yimeiot, was so brutally beaten to fall into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby election committee building was set on fire, and the next day, things were going to go further.
Approximately 1,000 young men, women and children from Papua gathered for justice on the football field in front of the local police station and the military control centre.
They carried ceremonial yachts and presented the waita dance of the Papua mee pago tribe, during which they ran around and buried the bird song.
Some protestors started throwing stones at the police and military.
When the evil aggravation has been sent to the soldiers through an internal radio. "If the crowd shows more than three resistances, drop them off," said the official document, which has been seen by TIMME, but which has not been issued to local media publications.
The senior Yeremias Kayame (56) of the City of Kego Koto, Enarotal, recognised a threat and called for peace to be maintained by asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"When I turned around, I was shot at the left wrist," he said to the magazine TIMME in its bright paints on the front of the tree house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a lot of money, a lot to shoot," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw got shot by a cousin said he hit three times.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was with him," said TIMME from the fall of Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, used only one name.
"I saw him die... I kissed him."
Pope Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that he was subject only to the security of his own station because it was attacked.
"We need to protect ourselves when we are threatened to kill," said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistio, police spoke in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watchi, five young protestors were killed and many injured.
The news about the killings only reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapuras held a passionate speech in which he expressed compassion for the victims’ families and allowed them to deal with the abuses in Papua.
"I want to solve this case right now, that it would never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism for the resolution of human rights crimes.
But almost immediately, excuses were followed.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes," he said.
On 5 June, in Jakarta, the magazine TIMME, Wiranto, however, withdrew his words saying that he had no intention of establishing a Papapa mechanism to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said that "all will be solved by law".
Wiranto, accused by the UN of the death of more than 1000 people in human rights crimes in the context of the 1999 blood independence revolution in East Timor, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Papua, including those in Panama.
The families of Pania’s victims accepted such claims with a sizable impoverishment.
"I've been questioned four times over the last three years, but no progress has been made," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still living in fear for years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother, Yacobus, confirmed the opinion that the people of Pania are afraid to break this incident.
He said he got beaten by the army after he had helped bury four victims.
"The army came looking for me from burying dead bodies," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in the Pania neighbourhood in Deiya.
One person was killed and 17 were wounded, including children, when he became a coup between the villagers and the manager of the construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
The male, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
The hateful villagers protested at the site before the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing rocks at police officers, the last of which responded with the warning bills.
But according to the locals, mobile Brigades (Indonesia armed police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in a large panic, we were afraid of revenge," said TIMME 29-year-old Dominggu Badi, who lives near the hospital and saw the unharmed entry.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of police officers involved and the return of the mobile Brigade from the region.
Pania has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtful development feeds on the dissatisfaction of the peoples of the Mee, many, Dani and Damal living in the Middle Mountains of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Revolutionary Army of the Free Papuan Movement (VPL), which, according to its opinion, defends the rights of the popes by providing, on occasion, attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL leaders come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the military's "defence of the sovereignty of the country" has been arresting Pania over the last few years and holding thousands of people on their own.
Some of them never show up again.
Paniad is known as a "tragicly forgotten place" among the Pope's people.
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
A small amount of rice sold at Enarotti is too expensive to buy for the locals.
The bread is the same unachievable.
People grow all their food themselves mainly from the Batat, in addition to a little fruit and foliage.
The knee sacrifice is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five bataat fields.
They usually keep most of the crop for the family, the rest sell on the local market.
Only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between refugees and new migrants, which have been reached a large extent since the opening of new routes at Nabire airport.
These few jobs that exist go better to educated and more prosperous migrants.
Patients often lack capital or the necessary skills to conduct a competitive business.
"The young people are not interested in staying here because there is no jobs or money," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Panian Council.
The isolation will keep the world's eyes away from Pope.
In addition, strict restrictions on foreign media are maintained.
At the beginning of this year French journalists, Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp, were sent out of Papua, because "they did not follow the relevant practices", although they had a rare film permit.
According to Mr. Phelim Kine, Vice President of the Human Rights Watchi Asian Department, the electoral promises of Jokowi have not been implemented to remove restrictions on transparency and development in order to promote reporting.
"In Indonesia, the entry of new threats to the visa rejection and the black list of journalists trying to report from the most peaceful provinces in Papua and Western Papua," he said in his statement.
The lack of a drill in journalism means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the neighbouring neighbours of Papua.
In March, the six Pacific States, Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands, encouraged the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "a wide range of crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Pania.
These same countries have historically supported VPL.
Mr Nasir, the press representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, turned aside the accusations of the group, saying to the journalists Jakartas: "In Indonesia, there is still a democratic procedure and freedom of the press, so that evidence of human rights cases would be difficult to bury."
Locals want more attention to foreign governments.
When the official delegation of the Netherlands took over the country's human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar on 4 May, Jayapura visited, local people stopped at the meeting, but anonymized by the source that wanted to remain anonymous, saying their silence, asking strongly: "We want freedom."
New presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019, but the Popes do not believe that they will vote again in favour of Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of Pania," says Hobai, Chairman of the Human Rights Council.
He wants to explain to Jokowi that, in addition to the fact that the people of Pania are constantly living under the threat of a predatory army, they are struggling because of their educational and health services.
According to Gobai, Pania’s people, like other Popes, regard their voice to Jokowi as a debt to be paid.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of Pania's shooting victims were subjected to the last symbolic countermeasure they buried one victim's body in the police station and the country against the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be set on foot, at least those responsible will not let them forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with his lower head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire swallowed Dubai Torch's cloudbreaker for the second time.
On Friday, the fire fed one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai, making hundreds of residents escape from this 337-metre and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that has destroyed a superstructure, which is called Torchi, or Storchi, for just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injury was reported and no direct cause of the fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up on the fire alarm and yelling at people.
We ran down the stairs, and we took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said Reuters a resident who called himself George.
According to the Dubai civilian security officers, firefighters had a flame off at about 4 a.m. during the local time (00.00 GMT) and were hunting the building.
The government said they were working for the victims to provide shelter.
This incident can once again raise questions about the safety of materials used worldwide on the external surface of high buildings.
In the investigation following Torchi’s fire in 2015, it was found that the most damage suffered by the decorative panels and isolation of the Fascades - outer surface.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the Grenfel Tower in London and the fascist panels may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June in which some 80 people were killed.
See: these phones are probably going to be sales architects in the fall.
Spring and autumn have a sweet time for technical fans, because then telephone manufacturers publish their new top models.
In spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came to the sale, also in autumn it is expected to have new hit-phones.
According to Kristjan Seema, TV2’s marketing and sales director, today’s flagship is characterised by an innovative design, an eye-tired scanner, a edge-to- edge 4K with a resolution of the screen and a high-speed processor.
The technology world, Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the front of the Estonian smartphone sales chart.
In autumn, smart customers will be able to avoid even more high-speed downloads, a more durable battery, a more high-quality camera, and greater water and dust security.
He added that, based on the hearings, you can already make assumptions and predict four top models that are likely to conquer sales trends.
These four top smart phone models will reach the poets in the autumn of this year.
Long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach poets already in mid-September.
You hear what the new Apple model looks like and what it can do is spread a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not make a significant difference next to iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to be completely different from earlier.
It is said of four colours: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
The new design of one of the elements is probably a screen that covers the entire phone’s front panel, lost home button and fingerprint reader are built in the screen.
Apple Design Manager JonyIve requires a new iPhone model to look like a smooth glass.
There has also been talk about the ceramic version of iPhone.
In addition to the eye-driving scanner, wireless loading and even more high-quality cameras, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
I'm sure it's one year of smart phones waiting for.
The pre-ordering of the new model Galaxy Note 8 begins on 23 August.
There's been a lot of rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 looks like.
It is said that even more business users are meant to be, and S Pen allows even greater functionality.
There should be two cameras on the phone, one of which is a wide-angle and the other with a narrower view field television object.
At this point, no one knows what two back cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test, which is definitely comparable to iPhone 8.
But we look forward to 23 August.
Although Nokia has sold three smartphones this year with Nokia 6, they still lack their flagship - Nokia 8, which is already presented on 16 August.
We look forward to the screen and high speed Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors and a more durable battery from Nokia 5,3 to the edge of the edge.
For Nokia, there is also talk about aluminium cork and a significant level of water and dust security IP68.
As with Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear camera cameras that the optics produce from Zeiss.
If Sony's secure flagship has so far been XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smart phones will be added with even more innovative features.
We're waiting for a smart phone that's a little more modest than XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
For Sony's new model, it has been speculation that its screen is at least six ton.
What we can see in reality is already the right thing because, traditionally, Sony has released its autumn flagship at the International Technology fair IFA, which will take place this year from 1-6 September.
According to leaked Transcriptions of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post disclosed the transmissions of phone calls between President Donald Trump of the United States and the Heads of State of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump called the Mexican president of Enrique Pena Nieto to stop the public declaration that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States used him to crack the wall for public judgment, saying, "You can't say it to the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign promise to build a South American wall and swear that Mexico would pay for this project.
Transcriptions were also published on his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which reveals a tense exchange of views.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees to Australia is 'near', 'near' and 'grey'. He said that the agreement made during Obama's government would leave the impression of him as he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States of America.
Trump finished the call, telling Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant speech of the day".
The Supreme Court did not file a complaint with OÜ MRP Linid on the case where the City of Tartu rejected their tender for the purchase of bus bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a certificate that was rejected by OÜ MRP Linid on the Tartu bus supply, since the tender failed to meet the requirements, the director of the City Administrative Services of Tartu explained Anneli Ahitin, who was the director of the City Administrative Services.
This is a public bus service project within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The MRP City Liins appealed to the Supreme Court for a decision of the Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court did not take this action.
While many complain that the noise from the Weeken Festival is disrupting their night and the entire city is full of parties, there are many people who have no bad words to say about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the parties at the store were so polite!
I didn't see any confusion or rudeness.
I even saw the kindness," says Laine.
"It's nice to be come, be, and be glad to have a Pärnu that is wintered like winter," he adds with joy.
The greasy Laine sleep doesn't bother you.
When he was living in the city centre, he still heard that music was played on the beach, and now the music hasn't reached his homecoming yet.
"But I hope to hear it," he says with pleasure.
Agnes, who has spoken to the evening newspaper, says that the grand festival is more good for Pärnu - it will help the local merchants.
In addition, he is pleased that so many foreigners have come to visit the capital of the summer.
It doesn't bother a woman with party noise.
Although I'm no longer on the beach, but I'm glad the beach is alive.
And I'm glad the people are moving, and it's been like this three times," says the woman.
It must have been a little worse for the first time.
"Then maybe there were complaints," he says.
But he said that the noise on the beach is common for the summer princes.
"This Weekly is a very good promotion for our little town," says Harri, in the park.
The noise and the dick haven't hit his rhythm of life either.
What about what?
We should all stick together.
Think about how this interaction between nations would be better.
The man of the loud music won't be mutated.
It doesn't bother, even though I live near there.
"Good people can stick together and there's no trouble," he talks.
The guests who came to Pärnu are polite, he says.
"They have, of course, a little oversized with bottles, but young people are young and Lord God - let go, but be human and we can do it!" he says.
By then, coastal residents have traveled away, either to relatives or to acquaintances.
"But in general the festival has a positive effect on people who like this noise," says Pärnu, walking with children, Tiina.
His family’s dream of festival music is not disturbed either, although last year it went even further than this year.
Last summer there was a second stage, then we heard more.
We'll live out of town ourselves, so that we can actually get back to the town of Pärnu pretty well," he says.
Pearson's cutting another 3,000 jobs and reducing the divisions to revitalize business
The British education company Pearson said on Friday that he would cut another 3,000 jobs and reduce his intermissions by 72 per cent, thus launching another restructuring programme to address the threat to business.
According to John Fallon, lost jobs are likely to be added to 4000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May the plan to cut the cost of the third cost reduction programme by another USD 300 million (394 million) in order to try to re-establish a business that has become agitated due to the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company that agreed to sell the participation of Penguin Random House in its partner company Bertelsmann last month said that their expectations for the year had not changed since the 1st percent increase in sales revenue of GBP 2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Konvoyant in Kabul: A suicide was killed by a NATO soldier
According to officials, the suicide bomber attacked military troops in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and killing several others.
The NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were killed in the incident in the Qarabah district of the city.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed by Herat Mosserena.
On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber near Iraq's embassy in Kabul.
NATO's statement said that Thursday's explosion took place when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "human-made explosive".
According to the statement, everything is damaged in a stable state and is being treated at the U.S. Military Hospital in Bagram Airport.
According to Correspondents, the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) are a major source of concern for the forces in Qarabah, NATO in Bagran.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan, approximately 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people were killed by a car bomb in Kabul.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people were killed by a large bomb attack in the city centre - this has led most to death by military attacks in the country since the U.S. forces that were led by the U.S. forces rejected Taliban power in 2001.
This violence highlights the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, is considering whether to increase the number of armed forces and police forces in the United States.
According to the Correspondents, suicides in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA withdrawn the suspension decision following an appeal.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA has withdrawn the decision to delay the imposition of the Obama-time regulation, which obliges States to limit the emissions from the summer, one day after 15 States appealed to the Court of Justice as a result of this move.
The EPA announced its decision to continue the "2015 ozone determination operations" late on Wednesday, saying that it shows the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the States Parties.
"We believe that we need to have a dialogue and listen to our partners from our states," said the EPA Head of the EPA in Scott Pruitt's statement.
Pruit had announced in June that EPA was intending to reject ozone levels, measured in different parts of the country, in order to determine where this level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to comply with a stricter air quality standard.
15 mainly democratic states, together with the Columbia District, brought an action on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to withdraw a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama.
But these efforts have led to countermeasures among democracies and conservation groups that are concerned about the impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhalation of ozone-containing air may "may reduce the ability of the lungs to work and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases", such as asthma.
German pigs may have a party.
German pigs and cattle may have a party, as strong rains threaten the yield of another wheat producer in the European Union, says Bloomberg.
This year, it may be that the harvests that lasted weeks before harvest may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry is only suitable for animal feed.
"The quality of this woman is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015," said Agravis Raiffeisen's analyst Bernhard Chilla.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can be sent to animal feed, which is twice as normal, forecasted in Agrov.
German farmers as well as their European colleagues have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring that was replaced by hot air in June.
In July Germany was hit by a rainstorm, which has continued in August.
Many eyes are turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvest.
Until then, only five percent of wheat has been harvested.
Most of the regions have not even started harvesting, the local acquisition collector in Ceravis reported.
"It's a pretty complicated day," said Ceravis' senior dealer Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Consistency with all, i.e. with Finnish interior design plans
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the brass homes, because through large windows, the wonderful views of Saimaa's fishermen reach many rooms (life).
At every step, the effort of our northern neighbours will begin to create both harsh and perfect (energy-efficient) homes at the same time.
The ability to use Finnish wood as construction and finishing material, furniture and beauty products is also a matter of inspection and compliance.
Virtual techniques and smart solutions can be found both by the builder and by the (home) designer in the mess houses.
It clearly shows that black, white and grey shades, if they are additional wood Tones and toilets, can be very mindful.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week because the mass lasts until 13 August.
Appliances and round pots suggest that this kitchen often cooks.
Last night against today, a line was drawn down to this year's Weekly Festival Baltice, and Martin Garrix gave everything to remember as the last performer.
The people had a real turn at the time of Garrix's performance, a song, a flute, danced self-sufficiently.
When Garrix finished, the same mass was spread out of Pärnu's beach across the city.
We'll bring you a gallery that has all the pictures that our photographer spent three days trying for Weekendi.
I'm sure you're one of them, too, find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko will meet for the first time, discuss the possible conflict
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to meet the most attractive boxing match in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were at ESPN's office in Los Angeles in separate rooms until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council's lightweight champion, walked on the other end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's closure champion.
After Garcia's unanimous decision, the victory over the former four-time world champion, Adrian Broner, on Saturday at Showtime, is one of both warriors.
Garcia handed his right hand and said, "How you doing, champion?
I wish you luck."
Lomachenko protects his belt with Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19 ESPN.
When a few photographs were posted, Lomachenko said the manager of the Klimas Klimas, that a possible match between the fighters would be "permanent measurement".
"I'm an ex-concentric," recalled Garcia.
"I moved up to [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small about 63.5 kg.
I want to move down the light weight.
And he must move upwards with light weight [60,2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fans have wanted that.
Let us offer them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid; this is part of his strategy to allow Lomachenkol to debut 61.2 kg in the end of this year in order to make it possible for the next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 naput), who also has an interest in fighting Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's match winner after their light-weight title forum on 23 September.
"Seeing this fight could be a reward, because fans have wanted it to be the opposite," Garcia said later that he would be open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We're the main performers.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he thought Lomachenko was a "great fighter" and could go see his Saturday fight.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in thanking Garcia, saying that he thought that the three division masters from Riverside were "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted to pick it up".
Garcia said the goal was to show the impact strength and then box.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension growing into a struggle between them.
"It's a fight that's waiting for realising.
None of the other opponents give so much attention and silence.
I'm more than willing to work for it," says Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is just that.
It will be a good fight."
From what angles of the world are moved to Estonia?
Mullu extended and issued record cards of more than 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals travelling to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, if it was decided to issue a fixed-term residence permit of 6702 to a foreigner, then that number was 4928.
Authorities cannot tell how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be drawn up in the Ministry of the Interior.
When, ten years ago, nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ago, this figure will be close to 2000 in recent years.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased dramatically during the Ukraine crisis - 1087 people received a fixed-term residence permit in 2014, 675 years earlier.
According to the Statistical Office, the number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia is increasing most, with 850 Ukrainians arriving in Estonia more than they left.
"The Ukrainian community has been great in Estonia all the time, and due to difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought in a country where the community and many people have already been ahead of the family", said Kristin Rammus, the press representative of the Ministry of Interior.
The number of Ukrainians who have been granted a fixed-term residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in ten years the number has been the most limited number of permanent residence permits.
When Ukrainians come here to work predominantly, Russian citizens for family migration.
"Thinking about this historical Russian community, they are also more likely to have the largest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, a migration scientist at the Home Defence Academy.
"When looking at where Russian citizens who have been granted a residence permit for Estonia have moved to live, after Harjumaa is immediately east-Virumaa", he added and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married the European Union citizen.
I have received a fixed-term residence permit of 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wished to extend the residence permit decreased instead.
"The reason for this is that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for permanently," Rammus, the Minister of Interior, explained, said that Russian citizens' interest in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years.
A new residence permit to permanently enter Estonia can be applied for by foreigners who have lived here for at least three years from the previous year.
Its aim is to promote the integration of adapted people.
However, a long-term resident’s residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably also been reduced because of the new residence permit.
For example, I was given such a residence permit for 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
The Ukrainians are now able to change their jobs and the Estonian state is no longer on the line as to whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit has become popular - applicants still have hall passport owners (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A total of 2,68 people were granted a residence permit for Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and as many Chinese people.
By the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants has already been 1269.
In the next ten years, the country, which has become a surpriseer from Nigeria, has become one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, a number of 200.
Nigeria's coming to college here.
Estonian higher education is also popular amongst Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of citizens in India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely thanks to the study migration.
They also have a rule that where the community has come forward, there will be easier access to others", added Rammus.
In ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example from North Korea, the same from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If you get a residence permit of about 6,000 third-country nationals per year, it is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if there were more European Union citizens, there would be about a percentage of migration," Maising commented that there were actually small numbers.
A total of 14 822 people traveled to Estonia according to the statistical office, while 13 792 from here.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration.
Most of them are Estonian citizens, but more are among those who leave.
Thus, the issue of migration of Estonian citizens was reduced by 2000 people.
Estonians travel primarily between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess house is charming with sats, pussies and a fight.
However, there is a history for Maria Tammeoru in the Northern Thought Line: old paintings and costumes: "I can dream and admire old-fashioned sparrows and collars in a museum for hours.
If you do something with a passion, you will study and learn more about it every day.
That's the pleasure of finding out!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem strange to some, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much shine your life is!
I've got a girlfriend who's got a whole sauna full of the haute country dresses I've created.
Because it's not his fault that he doesn't live in Hollywood and he doesn't go on a red carpet every day, he wants to wear these most beautiful dresses and wear them!
You can live your own life!
The fashionist does not recognise the gap between shining events and gray everyday days.
It is this thought that led to a set of plans to bring the high fashions to land, between forests and fields in Estonia, to people, to whom the fashions often fail.
Mammu’s collection was presented, for example, at Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu’s fashion hall, where a royal deficit of 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, they often take in the store, they don't know what to do, but elsewhere they're more emotional, they're screaming, they're getting up, they want to thank you for their hands.
A lot of the audience just came to remodel, but now they're Mammu Couture fans.
If you cross people's expectations, they'll be delighted!
And I like the feeling that I'm in my way like a summer trip.
We had a 50-metre red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, and it didn't seem to end!
Maria also fails to admit that the creation must be presented to a super-model, and she is happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own clients on stage - they've always come with pleasure.
It's such a nice experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry I've never seen my show myself, I've always been behind the stage to give the last one to things as hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve wouldn't allow me to look at the prey.
Maria is the kind of kind that wants to be in the hands of not only the representative role.
I have my sewing machine in the studio, most of the collections I do myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you discover.
I'm never far from my creation, and I'm not afraid of work.
It's not limited to design, including stylistics, logistics, organization, organisation - everything has to fit into the day of one temperament woman.
After all, these hours of work still come in huge numbers of fanatics.
I can't tell you when my working day is over, it's just a day full of joy for me!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an endless happiness chain: I do something beautiful, man gets something beautiful and in turn, compliments.
Many times it's been said that my dresses have magic - they make you feel like a princess.
The ostrich satire, which made Maria's talent famous overnight, has remained the signature of Mammu Couture today.
Martin Müürsepp of U18 boys: The Estonian sub-group tournament weapon was now turned against us
Sorry, the fairy tale's out.
The first thing I saw was that we didn't get our desk.
And when the difference comes in at the table, there is nothing to do," said the Estonian U18 basketball boys 61:75 remaining in the UK our only basketball player in the NBA, BC Kalev/Cramo auxiliary coach Martin Müürsepp.
The opponents took 28 balls from the assault table and they got so many more attacks.
We weren't ready for their aggressive defense or attack, it hit.
Many British attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build up protection.
By protecting them, however, they managed to keep their hands together all over the place, we couldn't combine.
It hit the crew's feet below.
The domestic work of the respondents was better done.
According to the Myursepa, Estonia would have made more tactical mistakes to take down the enemy's drive.
In the last quarter, we had a zero mistake, but our opponents have already had several quick baskets.
The attractiveness and close pursuit of our weapon on the sub-group tournament now turned against us.
Today, we had no power against their aggression.
The sale was left to peace with her underside in Kalevi, Matthias Tassi.
The tournament is generally able to say good words about the whole team, a single hit-and-run has been solved until today.
Too bad you've already met an aggressive opponent.
The cup has always been confident and played his way out today, but it seemed that he was tired - he's been wearing quite a burden.
But he made some pretty moves I've seen in practice before," added the coach.
Adjustable numbers: In the ladies' basketball library, the EM tournament threw less than 10 points on three quarters...
In the U18 age class, only young men’s EM B-divisjon basketball tournament in Tallinn began early in Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland, however, was in the area of anti-registers.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter, was standing at 9:49, perhaps only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took their foot off the gas pedal, and that period remained at line 16:16.
On the first and second quarter Estonia threw 4, on the third point...
In this way, in the first two minutes, the Estonians hit two of the first four shots, but in the second half of the game 25, one in three, and then another 21 out of the way...
Maybe in almost half an hour, 47 whiskeys were caught.
In addition, two points came from the four free toilets.
The loss of the ball was a reasonable number in that time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland had a whiskering rate of 33 and Estonia had 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two disappearances, on the opening day, Portugal 83:56 had to admit the benefits.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to complement supplies
Today, NATO’s primary mine control group 1 arrived in Tallinn for a weekend on a port visit to supplement ship’s stocks and prepare for the forthcoming exercises.
During the visit, ships are preparing to return to the sea and provide crew members with the opportunity for a few days’ leave.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and be ready for future historical explosives search operations.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and their co-operation in local waters is well reflected in our integration with the allied forces," said Commander of the Navy Operations and Planning Division, Captain Arto Reinmaa.
From 29 June, the Latvian Navy Commander Gvido Laudup, who took over the duties of the head of the group in Riga from the Estonian Navy Officer, Lieutenant Johan-Elia, in Seljamaa, is led by the Latvian Navy Force Force Force Commander.
The group's flagship is designated as the Latvian Navy Support vessel LVNS Virsait, which also operates as the leader of the group.
This half year, the composition of the international unit also includes the Estonian Navy Ministry Sakala.
One of the four groups of vessels under NATO's marine command is NATO's primary mine control group 1 as a first-time rescue unit, which could be sent to different parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita convent will once again be a place where the Brigitta Festival, which was called by the Maestro Eriks, will be held 13 years ago.
According to Risto Joosti, the Tallinn Philharmonic Artistic Manager (36) will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The students will reach the opera class, belonging to "Taviata" and "Tosca", the ball competitions from the enchanting "Bolerost" to "Karlsson", and there is also no plan for their own production, which will be the production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful Oracles by the same international creative team that brought Pirital stage to Haydn's second masterpiece in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre shows.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It's a festival with the snow taking power and never let go again.
For the experience that the listener can experience in this superior and mysterious environment puts human souls on hold and affects human senses in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the first artistic leader of the Birgitta Festival.
Didn't the maestro Special Dress shoes seem a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Erika, it's been a lot of help.
He led me through my entire student career and supported me at the beginning of the conductor's career.
Maybe that's why it's easier for me to continue his work.
Erik Klas has injected the Brigitta Festival team so much goodness and, of course, it's all passed on to me.
It was great to join a team who knew exactly how things were going.
The great heart of Erik Klas gave me the strength to go ahead with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What could the audience do at the festival this year, which you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania, and, as a surprise, the first ballet written by Astrid Lindgren.
That's what Karlsson's about to fly for.
And one of the criminal nuances about it is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer, Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed his wish to write this piece.
He's probably had Karlsson's character in his soul since he was a child.
Risto, how can you do all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner, I'm sure.
Such work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have it.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend as much on other people as on myself, perhaps on how I can resist every new day.
And keeping this conscious tone, keeping positive, and actually smiling at yourself in the morning mirror significantly increased my fortune rate.
Especially now this week, when the most important tests are being done, I have especially worked on it and it works.
A smile of her own activates her brain and lifts tone.
It's not just a word.
I don't think people know half the stuff about their body that the universe offers to them, but it's not everyone who's going to find out.
Now, it's an important moment.
Do you have any rituals before you step on the conductor's counter?
Yes, you have to change your clothes for more comfortable.
It's this little moment for yourself.
But in general, I don't have a chance to rest until I've done a big show or to make a little sleep.
In fact, I even like to actively communicate with people, even before I enter the conductor's party.
But come to Birgitta Festival, here's something to discover, not even a very big opera and ballet friend!
Look at the moody video with Risto Joost!
New results of the Swedish age assessment tests were published
In Sweden, a medical examination of their age with a new approach was carried out amongst asyl applicants. The latest results of the test indicate that more than 80 percent of tested subjects were evaluated older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute for Public Medicine (Rätsmedicinalverket) started the tests in the beginning of this year.
The tests were set up for a more accurate assessment of age in the course of the application for azyl after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) was criticised for having failed to correctly determine the age of several alleged minors.
For the time being, the Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases and the Institute of Justice has issued a total of 2481 test results between mid-March 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) was assessed as 18 years old or older, and in 25 cases, the Institute of Public Medicine assessed that the test could be "may be 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that human beings are "presumably younger than 18".
The test is only used if the age of a person is under the question mark.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Justice, the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
"We don't see a big difference compared to previous months' statistics, the numbers are quite consistent," he said to the newspaper The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as older than 18, does not necessarily mean that asylic applicants have lied about their age.
In May 581 the Institute issued the results of the test and said that in 442, "there are indications that the subject is 18 years old or older".
But when the Svenska Dagblade newspaper examined the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that in 243, a person had directly argued that he would receive 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, in which the X-ray images of wisdom teeth and the MRT of knee joints are taken into account, after which they are analysed by dentists and radiologists, have been criticised in some circles.
One of the sceptics is the endocrinoologist of the Karolinska Institute, Claude Marcus, whose tasks include the assessment of the biological maturity of people, to determine whether they passed through puberty earlier or later.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the current measurement method should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't make a face that we can," he said to the newspaper Metro.
But Johan Göransson from the Institute of Justice defended the accuracy of the tests: "It is generally possible to say that the child is at little risk of being fully adult.
The greatest risk, perhaps at around 10%, is when a person is a little less than 18."

A 20-year-old hammer thrower, Anna Maria Orel, made a beautiful debut at London's MM, getting a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was the youngest woman in the world, and a happy wife confirmed that she was hoping to fight for the medals in the future.
The competition went well and I got a good experience.
With the first test (64.80) I immediately removed my average result, the second (62.80) I risked too much and the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear", said Orel after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm really glad I found it.
Anna Maria Oreli's MMi debut ended well with 18 places.
The rainfall orel didn't interfere because he's training the winter through the TTÜ stadium.
"I'm scratched," he said with a little mummy.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house of people, did Orel realize people around himself or were able to turn off?
I get it, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it gives more - that's right!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that she would remain in peace with MM's debut, and she's still waiting for a lot of good competitions: "I've come here for the 32th of this season, or the last result, I've finished at 18.
This is a very good result.
I'm 20 years old and MM is the only thing that matters.
I'm taking a good experience, and one day I'm going to have a fight for the medals.
West Virginia Governor announced a party change
On Thursday evening, President Trump and President Trump announced that he would exchange political parties.
"Let's like it or not, but the Democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I say to you, having prayed and thought about it... today I say to you, Western Virginias, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
There was joy in the assembly.
"This will make me a Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"Treenerina, I'd tell you it's time to play another game."
Trump had previously promised a big announcement at the gathering of West Virginia.
Trump won by 42 points in West Virginia, and Justice did not support the Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and the coal mine was his father.
His value is about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, on Thursday evening, the National Committee of the Republics (RNC) announced that "the change of Governor Justice is another blow to the democratic party, which would rather prevent the country from being made better than work for it".
"From all 15 governors and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent rejection of the party that is completely unmanageable and cannot find a positive and connecting message," said Ronna McDaniel.
It is not a surprise that there are many people, there are many injured ones.
The Urmet at the medical tent last night said to the evening newspaper that they had had had to hand out quite a lot.
The cereals and raves are the main, out of the bends and light fallouts.
Of course, head, back and foot pains.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with false shoes and so problems come.
Media have also had to assist a few more injured visitors - there have been a few panic attacks and also one leg fracture.
We have also made sewings when a person has broken his hand or finger.
We're going to get the smallest seams out here, get the bigger ones to go to the hospital.
Look at the video, see if the festive medics ask for painkillers.
Coe accepted the Russians' sincere apology for the dopingus canal.
According to his words, the international noseman Sebastian Coe, "Russia's Thursday sorry" for the doping canal, but repeated that this is not the time to allow the country's sport back.
The Russian light-powered noseman Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAAF convention that his country's competition ban was correct and he has a certain aim of fighting doping.
He said he'd apologize for "all the light-powered people who have been caught in competitions with gold medals and silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the competition ban established in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state supported doping in Russia.
"I think that today was a very honest response, very honest presentation," said IAF President Coe to journalists.
"The Health Council and the whole convention were satisfied that the Russian alliance itself acknowledged that they had had had a pretty difficult time and that they would do everything possible to restructure the Union."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted its own recovery criteria.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and that progress is taking place, but the Congress supports the group's proposal that this is not the time to withdraw Russia," said Coe.
"We need to do everything in the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always been based on the principle that we want to separate pure athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian Light Forces, meeting the strict IAAF criteria, will compete as neutral athletes at World Championships starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia still does not meet several criteria for recovery.
Following a report from the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that the doping check was still insufficient and that trained workers were still not allowed to operate freely.
The revolution of electric cars significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
The fact that the revolution of electric cars significantly changes everything from fuel market to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers on the metal market.
Although mines like Glencore can say that one place they win and lose, smaller mining companies do not help.
Currently, Glencore serves as coal and oil, but in the age of electric cars, cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel demand are growing.
This year, in terms of the spread of electric cars, the UK, France and Norway have increased their contributions to the decisions of the governments of the United Kingdom, which will allow for a ban on the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
That is why Volvo has already announced that they intend to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring the cheaper Model 3 electric cars to the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that electric cars will be sold more than cars using fuel from oil for a period of two decades.
"As for some metals, this changes everything," said Capital Economics raw material analyst Simona Gambrani Bloomberg.
We have already seen a great impact on metals such as caves and lithium, whose demand has grown for years.
The electric cars have about three times more copper than the conventional car, reported Glencore.
More copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Pabarisi estimates that it will increase the demand for copper by around five per cent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric cars' batteries means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glencore gains from the growing trend of electric cars from the increase in copper prices and the fact that it is the world's largest cobalt manufacturer, Jefferies Group predicted.
According to this broker company, the other electric cars will win Freeport-McMoran and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is responding to the already changing trend.
This year, 70 percent of London's metal exchange caves have grown.
The high price increase was 37 percent.
The copper has also grown by 14% this year, mainly due to economic growth.
The Glencore share rose by 20 percent in London, after crossing the line from the price increase to Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billito and Anglo America.
On the losing side, there are lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine who have to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of lead is batteries that supply starters for petrol and diesel engines.
Electric cars use lithium batteries.
"This is a serious risk to ploughing unless another purpose is found to overcome the decline in demand," said Bank of America Merrill Lynch, metal market analyst Michael Widmer.
In the face of the price movement of the lead, there is no noticeable trend yet.
Pli has grown by 17 percent this year, which is the best metal in London, among the main industrial metals, from the price rise.
Investors see problems with metal only far away in the future.
"I'm not sure that lead is so bad, because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars in competition," said the metal brokerage company Triland Metals' sales manager Herwig Schmidt.
If the lead falls into demand, it'll be slow.
It might happen in about ten years.
Until then, however, tougher exhaust standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which depend on advanced lead-based batteries, will be assessed by the international lead and zinc research organisation when starting frequent engines.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel, as the lighter car can drive away with less electricity.
It is already explained by an additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium demand until 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 per cent of the total aluminium production in the world.
This trend is probably getting worse, said Widmer.
Aluminium has grown by 13 percent this year, as increasing demand by car manufacturers has led to market deficits.
Steel producers don't sleep.
The AK Steel Holding cooperates with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of amazing cars.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter fuse steel to resist aluminium Museum.
"The compatible steel should be the answer to this development", said the Exane BNP Paibas analyst Sylvain Brunnet.
Some progress has been made in Europe.
The end of the nifty age can also bring suffering to the platinum.
I needed about half of this metal diesel engine to be catalysts for cars, reported metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"In many cases, high demand for raw materials such as oil and platinum may not have much demand in the future," said Natixis raw material analyst Bernard Dahush.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will become more important over 15 years.
The platinum producers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, Head of Uncore, said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold from full-electric cars.
In the 10-year term, the high hope of the platinum producers is that of the hydrogen-based cars developed by Tokyo Motor and Hyundai Motos, which depend on the platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
However, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
"Dizel seems to have a clear loser on the way to electric cars," said Exane BNP in Pabaris Brunet.
German car manufacturers received a major setback in July, as Stuttgart's court refused the use of the diesel in Mercedes-Benzi and Porsche's hometown.
How football finance rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unbridled consumption of European football clubs do not prevent the world record transition from the Spanish football club to the Paris-Saint Germain club in Barcelona.
Whatever consequences from the UEFA, the management body that rules the European game and which has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestitial Master League tournament, Paris is still waiting for Saint-Germain.
UEFA’s fair game financial rules (FFP) established in 2011 mean that PSG must at any time prove that Neymar’s transition was financed without enormous losses.
The EUR 222 million (EUR 226 million) was paid to Barcelona solely for the purchase of Brazilians out of his contract, and Neymar's salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of the transfer to Neymar's French club.
The PSG will undoubtedly be able to recruit Neymar and take out such money in order to include its starring order, given that the team is financed by the family that controls Katari's energy crime.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of time recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal income sources that allow them to come out of football.
The FFP set up Michel Platin after he was elected President of the UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that go into large debts in search of success are actually engaged in fraud and risk stealing if banks or owners should give up support.
From 2011 onwards, FFP will focus on monitoring their losses instead of the debts of FFP clubs.
This change means that the business model Roman Abramovich used first in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a club with potentials and then to make big expenses in order to make the team better and create a global brand is more difficult to implement.
For the current three-year evaluation period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs may bear losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platin's shameless rejection of the President's office in 2015, his successor, Alexander Cefer, is still committed to preventing excessive consumption.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules," said the last week to the Associated Press Andrea Traverso, who is the supervisor of the FFP in UEFA.
While the PSG paid Neymar for the oversale clause as a single full payment, they can split that amount for accounting purposes into parts throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar entered into a five-year contract and therefore it is possible to show the transitional fee as a sum of EUR 44,4 million for the next five years.
With regard to the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, received the most severe punishments on the neck.
PSG was fined EUR 60 million (i.e. USD 82 million) which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to limit the team of the Masters League in 2014-2015 to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to plan over the regulatory financial institutions by turning their incomes on the basis of companies related to the owners of the club.
While PSGs may be sponsored by Katari's company, if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be taken into account as an official income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of Qatar Tourism’s PSG support was set up.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymar’s PSG service can come from Kataris through the 2022 World Championships Management Committee payments.
However, PSG and Katar 2022 deny that Neymarist could become a World Championship ever since, and claim that the UEFA regulatory authorities could easily reveal such a maneuver.
Penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the rules.
On Thursday, people familiar with the situation said that UEFA had not previously discussed with PSG about Neymar's transition.
They spoke to the Associated Press on condition that they were assured of their anonymousness because they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published reports show that PSG earned more than EUR 10 million in profits during the 2015-2016 season at turnover of around EUR 542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar’s arrival will have a good impact on sponsorships, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase of at least 30 % in turnover in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, being clearly upset about leaving one of the biggest football players, tried to prevent Neymar's transition, claiming that PSG was breaking the FFP.
"This is a clear "financial doping" case with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas said to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG primarily belongs to Katari.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports master, shares La Liga's attitude that the country is funding the club.
"This is the result of property rights, and over the last 15 years it has completely changed the whole football scene," Wenger said on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of the honest game, as the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player country."

Today 50 years ago: the storm of the orange dimension in Estonia, which torn roofs and windows from houses.
The storm of the century caused major damage to the Westland, Harjumaa and Raplamaa in particular on 6 and 7 August.
In North Estonia, during those days the wind was more than 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one karable tree to another in the garden and covered them with his hands to support them.
Everything was dark and gloomy, like the end of the world.
In 2002, Linda Kurova, from Haapsalu, who was already in the houses, recalled the interview provided by Estonian Nature.
Linda's husband saw her planting garden collapse.
But what do you still support the trees with your hands, where you get this storm?
The sea came under the window, from the windows poured water in," said Mrs Linda's tone on Haapsalus Kalda Street.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the pendulum roof of the railway station had flown 20-30 metres away, Linda, like most of the Haapsalus, only saw the next morning.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa lay down, some lay down, some by half.
It all seemed very diabolical, the storm went through beautiful old trees like a war.
In August 1967 the West-Virumaa could not suffer particularly seriously compared to Western Estonia, but the damage was also high there, wrote Virumaa Official Journal in 2007.
Haapsalu Lossipark and Padise Park were wiped out from the ground egg, but our ducks also suffered heavily.
In Tallinn, the wind was measured at a speed of up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
At 6 o'clock in Tallinn, there was a little girl in the seafield saying, "Mom, Mom!
Chickens are in the air and can't get down!", wrote Virumaa Official Journal.
The building of Põll’s manor, located in the region of Viljandi, was destroyed during the storm so that it was decided to be destroyed later.
Augustitorm was not able to withstand the constructions of Türi's ski pole, which were later no longer restored.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star wrote that cleaning cities and settlements from reduced trees and their branches slowly progress, and that residents could be involved in cleaning work.
In the storm it was also hard to suffer from crop crops, and the newspaper reported that "partisan organisations must be an incentive and guidancer to both repairs and harvests".
Orcans can be spoken if the average wind speed exceeds 32,7 m/s.
The record of pure wind in Estonia will last from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul was measured at 48 m/s.
So the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded on the island of Vailloo.
Secret of clean bathing areas: night cleaning and poor beach weather
The cold summer worlds also mean a smaller harvest in Tallinn's bathing areas.
"If there is no weather, then people are on the beach, and if there are no people," says the beach cleaner.
The kayaks at the beach of northern Tallinn, Strom.
For them, melodic competition is provided by a tractor on low rotations, which lowers the stripes on the plate.
In fact, the last slides through the sand in a depth of seven centimeters, picking out the sea bristle and people's leftovers: bottle heights, cigarettes and more.
People are still coming to the beach, regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If there is a beautiful weather, then people are on the beach, and if there are no people," says Alexander Usov, Head of the Department of Administration of the Beach.
It's 6.30 a.m. and there's some bitter cleaning work on the beach, because at 8:00 a.m. the platform must be fine for people.
Usov's already on the job at 4:00.
In addition to Strom, he will keep an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, Lake Kakumäe and Pikakar of Paljasaari.
The quantity of waste has decreased.
Years ago, it was a lot more than that.
People are already able to assess what is being done for them", says Usov, who has been cleaning the beach for 15 years.
Before that, when something new got up, it was broken the next day.
Now they're keeping what's on the beach.
Clean beach price
One of the biggest works on the shores of Estonia is the cleaning of seaweed or adru.
For example, at Pirita’s beach, it has to be spent 400 000 tons after the beach season.
"It's an incredible amount," notes Usov.
The second large category forms a domestic waste, or all that people leave behind.
There are eight large garbage containers on the beach of a half-kilometre of Strom, which need to be emptied three times a week.
That's how much garbage comes out.
However, colder summer worlds have meant that garbage is five less than otherwise.
The third species consists of leftovers.
They're mostly children's lives.
This is the harvest that Usov has swept out of the sand by a ten-way model car.
These owners remain waiting for the shore-line bounds.
"It's gonna come out more than that, but it's a normal prey." Usov already knows that he'll soon find them again inside the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them again in the sand.
The trash will be discoloured
Erika Scholler, a representative of the administrative services of Haabrist, admits that the screening work of the tractor interferes with the localities.
The noise that lasts from night to morning interferes with the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
But it's impossible on the day.
One month you'll have to go through the beach twice.
"If we don't do that, the part of the city is punishing us," Scholler says.
However, similar to Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu, the aim is also to get the beach of Strom under the international quality mark of bluewood.
"There is much more work in Estonia compared to Europe to ensure that the beaches are maintained," says Scholler.
We've got more scars and stones and harder to fight sand.
However, there will be less garbage on our shores than anywhere else in Europe.
Upon hearing that the beach is talking about garbage, Martin, who lives near the beach of Strom, comes into the conversation circle of a journalist and cleaning workers, highlighting the current weaknesses of the beach.
There's a disgusting picture all morning.
The problem is birds and bottle repairers who have pulled the garbage bags into the bakery," says Martin.
While it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about garbage cans and, for example, put on cover to prevent at least birds from renewing there.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of the beach of Strom.
You can see that the city will take care of it.
With children’s fields, illuminated and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
Once upon a time, there was only one way to drive on rollers," says Martin.
Aardeküt's inventions in Strom: coins, only coins
Morning, the sword period has come to use 40-year-old Dimitri, who comes to the shore with a metal detector.
He doesn't think he'll find anything precious today or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough for that.
"I've been on it for a year and haven't found anything worth," says Dmitri.
As Hobiaardecüüt, Dmitri has some euro coins, bottle caps, and also dangerous nails that later throws into the trash.
Usually, there are coins.
"You know, you don't usually have rings, and you don't have that kind of stuff," says the treasurer.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected from the Bank of England that interest rates will remain at the former level, as the decline in power-driven economic growth and inflation have softened speculation regarding the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain a spell, since household incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The policy makers of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of keeping the 6:2 levels at 0.25%, and less members will require an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened its support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast by 1.7% in 2017 and by 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on households' incomes will remain, as inflation is still expected to rise by 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the Bank also indicated that the increase in rates will be necessary to control the inflation caused by Brexit over the next few years and that there may be a need for higher than expected loan costs in financial markets.
The members also voted for the partial withdrawal of the MAM package, which led to the entry into force of the Brexit one year ago.
In February, the Bank will close its fixed-term financing scheme, which will provide banks with cheap financing, although it said that it is now expected that 15 billion dollars more bids will be expected under this scheme, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision taken on the determination, the bank says: "In the mid-term forecast of the CAP, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain in force in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household income will continue to affect consumption."
The definitions have been repeated as to the need for "a somewhat tightness of monetary policy" in order to mitigate inflation and to the extent "very much greater" when markets are expected.
The stock exchange is now predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and the second rise in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any jumps are gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast growth rate of 1.8% in 2018 remained stable.
After this news, the pound rate for the dollar and the euro fell.
The pound fell to 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 Euro.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointment-making growth indicators, which have reduced the growing hopes of the rise in GDP growth from 0.2% in the second quarter of the previous three months to 0.3%.
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will start to slow down slightly.
The latest inflation report by the bank gave little reason to rejoice with the rising inflation and the poorer waged households, saying that the situation would get a little worse before recovery.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent a hit of income in the next few years, but a marked recovery of wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak pound, the growing demand for British production also stimulates the economy, which partly compensates for lower consumer costs.
The decision will be taken one year after you were assigned to 0.25% of last August after the shocking EU referendum, which caused sudden weakening of the pound.
According to the Bank, it is likely that it will take four years for prices and the economy to enter into full life.
Before the last decision of the bank, there was a growing demand for increased rates, as inflation had increased pressure on households in distress; in July three policy makers required an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell by 2.6% last month compared to 2.9% in June, although the Bank said it was predictable and in the coming months there will be another rise.
The Bank said that excessive growth compared to a 2 % target was caused by a completely weak female.
Andrew Montlake, head of the mortgage brokers of Coreco, said: "In view of the recent decline in the exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming more competitive, as the borrowers want work and hope to end the year positively.
The exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions will be completed, as refinancing, often at a low level of service, has become increasingly popular."
NHS is writing a conflicting HIV medicine for 10 000 people
Patients have had access to preventive treatment of HIV from September to preventive treatment after the battle in the Supreme Court on whether NHS should be financed.
NHS England reported that, during the initial three-year clinical trial, public health is estimated to be available to 10 000 people in pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) tablets that are administered before the interval and have shown a reduction in the risk of infection by approximately 86%.
NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the Board of Appeal supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year that NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite its own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, the CEO of NHS England, welcomed this move published on Thursday as a "new comprehensive intervention", while the National Aid Fund (NAT) described it as a "reversive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October more clinics will be added before the programme is implemented throughout England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure Prevention (PrEP) is a courses of HIV medicines that are taken before the interval to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials indicate that PraEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people with infectious infections.
Taking PraEP before the interval means that there is sufficient amount of medicines in the human body that prevent the infection of HIV.
Such medicines may be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the end of the period.
The treatment of suitable candidates includes gay or bisexual men, transsexual people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not being treated.
Clinical signs are identified by appropriate individuals who are willing to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transsexual people and those whose HIV-retroviral partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish for participation in the local sexual health clinic participating in the program.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to obtain medicinal products this week after the international procurement procedure.
The objective of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PraEP by collecting clinical evidence of who the medicine is intended for and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new wide-ranging intervention should complement and enhance the wide-ranging and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in the struggle for more than three decades with one of mankind's greatest health problems."
Deborah Gold, NAT CEO, said: "This is a turning moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is properly targeted at those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people with high risk HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on negotiating with a partner, funded by NHS, thereby improving many lives.
We welcome this announcement warmly."
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Fund, said: "It is now essential to ensure that the clinical trial over the country is postponed rapidly and that no HIV risk group participant is excluded.
Now that PraEP has been prescribed a clinical trial, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.
Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: "The beginning of a clinical trial in PrEP is very welcome and is very late after months of delays and the fall of government feet.
The evidence shows how much changes this medicine can bring to the end of HIV prevention and the spread of its life-forming infection.
This clinical trial leads us step by step to the full understanding of the benefits of the PreEP.
It is now important that a clinical trial is taken over the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us step by step closer to the suspension of HIV spread in society."
The price of electricity rose by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania it fell.
The difference between prices for electricity in Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania for the next day decreased to EUR 1.94 compared to EUR 7.71 in June this year, Elering reported.
The main reason for this difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Sweden Community.
In Estonia, the average exchange price for electricity was EUR 34,33 per megawatt-hour last month and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent from 36,27 euro megawatt-hours.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34,17 and the system price for Nord Pool was EUR 26,37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices rose by 12 and 7 per cent, respectively.
The electricity between Estonia and Finland moved 75 per cent of the previous month’s hours towards Estonia and 16 per cent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine percent of the hours were not transactions between the two countries for the following day.
The electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved 99 per cent from Estonia to Latvia, and 73 per cent of the hours had full transmission capacity.
According to transactions on the Nasdaq OMX market on the last trading day of July, the electricity exchange price may be around EUR 34 and EUR 37 megawatt-hour in August.
The price of carbon dioxide affected by the electricity production price rose last month and transactions took place at a price of 5,04-5,47 EUR/tonne.
Living high standards - half floor and smart design tips have turned this little Earl Court apartment into a roomy home
Joanne Leipzig, former banker, who is a passionate real estate developer, changed his home in Knightsbridge in 2014 to Earls Court's apartment.
It's on Queen Anne Terrace's first floor, and Joanne hasn't packed up her bags and resold her apartment, is a tribute to a new design.
"before that I lived with a former partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this apartment in Earl Court, and it had the same high rates.
I fell in love with it and made an offer on the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93-metre apartment has passed through the full innovation cycle.
At the beginning it was one bedroom and a complex apartment - to reach the bedroom had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half floor to use high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azad's architecture and design studio at Notting Hill, Duck & Shed, to use the 3.8 m height ceilings and create a home that would not just be a developmental object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The law was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-creature where you can stand up.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
"The forest structure is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to reorganize the rooms, so they were on each other's side without being a freak.
It wasn't just the construction of the platform, we used the steel structure to make the height of both the upper and the lower space right."
This regulation enabled Erfan to create two full-time rooms in the room with a lot of dramatic elements.
On the half-storey side, the old-time copper opens up to a glamorous living room in the view of the retrovius window.
The golden furniture with mirror surface, silver details and the retro-flung Serge Mouille light highlight the space style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatre, spatial and light-freeness.
The mirrors on both ends of the short corridor are attached to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror will leave the window opening in the other room.
At the entrance, the reflector offers a storage place for all Joanne's meals and glassware.
The living room adds the magic of the possibility of closing down the kitchen part if not used by creating a more glamorous space of imagination.
The kitchens to be collated are nothing new.
At this kitchen, however, it is a unique fact that this is the door to the garage type.
"There went a bit of a design problem," explains Erfan's door from D.M.F.F.D. with steel support.
"It has a counterbalance, which is why it slides very easily if it is to push it up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage, Joanne now has 16 extra meters, an extra bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"In the end, the floor area is what you sell - or what gives value to real estate," said Erfan.
"The treasure broker enters an obsolete room and makes calculations based on the area of the floor."
Here they have managed to increase the floor, using high quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"The materials are what you touch and which help to create an emotional bond with the home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make your heart ring."
This shows that good design and increased area help to make a rather ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they can cause a desire not to leave, as did Joanne.
The main player, Dane Jensen, is the head hunter in Chicago's cloud-breaker, who competes with my colleague for a promotion.
It doesn't matter anything but the amount of money it earns, and it forgets all the ethics.
My wife and three children only see a man early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I think it's a business version of "The Card House" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech manager are similar.
The movie goes on, the less the frame-house element remains, and the moralist intention of filmmakers is becoming more and more apparent.
As a life-changing experience, the main character will have a son’s cancer.
Now we have to make a choice between work and family life.
The son who dreamt of the architecture makes his father walks around major buildings in Chicago to think about really important things such as faith, goodness, love... without touching even the disaster of the two-sectors.
After the third scene, where the son opens his eyes, it is evident that filmmakers have come from the purpose of having to cry for the audience, since even the most pale-hearted viewer can't keep tears back in sight of the suffering of the dear-patient boy.
When his son falls into a coma and his situation almost seems hopeless, his father will finally understand his work for immorality and do good work for an old man.
Now I'm gonna bet on myself - if the movie has a happy ending, I'm gonna give it to myself after the movie's coffee, but if I'm wrong, at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a doubt that I'll miss coffee when my husband calls Dane from the hospital, and he'll storm down the hallway room.
However, the son is wonderfully well - healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it will prove to be positive, because now it is time to deal with the family.
I can also feel well - I can predict the end of the American drama!
The truth is that the film is well-designed, all the elements necessary for it exist.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and moral beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure this movie's gonna be good for you.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
Then he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information from President Trumpin, including news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in a more smoother water.
Here's a broken reporter from Josh Dawsey:
"When the new Chief of Staff of the White House John F. Kelly met with high officials on his first working day, he identified the key problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he was planning to solve in the hands of the President.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to go through her, whether on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions than to share good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems totally logical, but others have tried it, and they have failed to watch Trump's media use.
President Trump's relationship with television lasts for decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his television-visual habits are nowhere.
"When a candidate, Trump, was angry because of an unfair media demonstration, it was worth showing him that he was reflected honestly in the relevant publications," said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg in February in Politicole.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "the former six campaign workers say that Trump is the key to managing Twitter habits is to ensure that its personal media consumption includes also a stable runway".
All right.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits have never been "controlled under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe those campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know that Trump's shirts without their intervention were even more mature.
We'll probably never know about the sparks that Trump didn't post.
If his assistants could save him a couple of times from trouble, their efforts were worth it.
But no one's been able to stop Trump from creating all kinds of nomadic.
Part of the problem is that people in the White House who compete with each other are trying exclusively to promote their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their world outlook, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, which reflects the whole course of the story, wrote in May a tendency to feed the president information with strategic questionable value.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Freaks and former Trump subordinates say that Trump can respond to a negative press, especially to harmful information leaks, explosively, by being obsessed with identifying their source.
This was also the case at the end of February when a copy of the article on GotNews.com web site, Charles C. Johnson, who accused Chief Staff of Staff Katie Walsh of being the source of the White House's information.
It doesn't matter that Johnson's been permanently blocked off Twitter, or that he didn't offer any concrete evidence, or that he's filed false charges in the past and taken them back.
Trump read the article and began to ask the subordinates about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that that that time chief of staff Reince Pricebus and Head of White House Office Rob Porter "was trying to establish a system for managing and documenting the documents available to Trumpini".
How did it work?
Kelly's trying to do exactly the same three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader of Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unaltered factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad are not allowed to perform bitter acts.
There are many foreigners in the city centre of Tallinn to decorate.
Those with whom the Evening Paper got into the story admitted they were playing in the old town without permission from the city government.
First, we found three street musicians near Viru Gates who had taken the same amount of dogs with us.
It was clear to see that musicians with rastacks and broken clothes were back-bag migrants, who could use a shower to get away.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the company played a story with a good rhythm, while one man next to her was juggled with three balls and invited passers closer.
The third man had sat next to them on one backpack and smoked himself a screwed fuck.
The three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing people.
Bob, who played with Noem and the balls, said they were kissing on the streets for fun and money.
The aim of the company's performance was to collect tickets to a ship flying to Finland on the same night.
Asked if they asked the city permission for mussing in the old town, and they were shaking Noem's head and Bob's head.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city more than a day or a couple and will usually be allowed for a month or something.
There's no point in paying for this," Bob explained.
When we got back to Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw two women at the musicians and drive them away.
The Society moved in with its backpacks and dogs to the Viru Center intersection to test luck.
There were also three Polish young men on the Viru street, one playing violin, the other piano, and the third had carried an electronic piano.
"We are here to provide people with entertainment to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and living," explained the Trio pianist Mikosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that there must be permission for the city government to perform.
"We certainly don't have it," he said when he was kidding.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we'll go somewhere else, but we'll try," he added.
Eesti Pank bought bonds for EUR 149 million in July in the framework of the public sector asset purchase programme of the euro area central banks, the central bank bond portfolio increased to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank shall not publish more detailed information on purchases.
The President of Eesti Pank Hardo Hansson has previously explained that the Eurosystem central banks' asset purchase plans include three different purchase programmes: financial covered bonds (covered bonuses), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public bonds (PSPP).
The central bank will buy bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
The purchase will result in lower-risk asset yields and will motivate investors to take greater risks.
As a general rule, in the framework of a public bond purchase programme, each central bank will buy its government bonds, and other government bonds will not be purchased.
Since the Estonian State has not issued bonds, the Bank will make so-called replacements within the limits of the volume allocated to them.
Replacements are also carried out by central banks in those countries where the provision of debt equivalent to the purchase plan is limited.
According to Hansson’s confirmation, the Bank generally buys European institutions’ bonds, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank’s bonds.
Eesti Pank will buy bonds under the asset purchase programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering’s bonds were also acquired, but from June 2016, Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering’s bonds.
Both Elering and Eesti Energia’s bonds are bought by the Central Bank of Finland on behalf of the euro area central banks since June.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to the "millionaires' districts"
Some of the most wealthy domestic owners in West Midlands have once again come into a rage with determined migrants who have ignored the ditches of the council to win back the field that is far from their wools.
The travelers have parked their 20 trailer servants in the field on the streets of the wealthy "Million District" crossed near Solihull Street.
They have returned with the army of horses, children, and trucks since they were only kicked out of May, without letting themselves get mixed up in a ditch that was dug up by the council to prevent them from being intruded.
The tactical team found a weak spot in the protection zones by pushing their vehicles through the uninhibited part that had been left on foot.
Maruvihas live in a council of Solihull, saying that the council is "unprofit to deal with the problem".
One anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday night after their desolation from Bentley Heathis, where they were throwing pastors with stones.
The Council should be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driving away, and now they're back again.
They came up last night, probably even more today."
He added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by getting long barriers to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook's way, and I'm not happy that I have to continue to pay the council's fee if the council can't even stop this kind of thing."
One local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said, "It's ridiculous. We saw the last of them leaving the migrants, and there's already a new attack.
This time, the number has grown and even the horse has been seen in the grass.
The representative of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that in a country near the Streetsbrook Road there is an unacceptable campground, and we are working with the Solihull Police. We are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
The collection of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling number 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the court if we present the case to them."
Indrek Saar, a cultural minister who is pleased that Estonia has been able to bring real world top names.
The question of why the Weeken festival is so important for Estonians is that it should be asked by all those who enjoy three days of the festival in full honor.
But he will know that the real ones in Pärnu have arrived in his territory.
"In view of the level of artists that have been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute peak names of this music genre are brought home - this is often not the case in our cover", says the Minister of Culture.
What kind of festival, however, do the artists present themselves most speaking about Saar?
I think I'm a relatively old man, and for people like me, one of the most experienced artists, Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
According to his record, all of us have at some point been running their own feet," he says.
But he'll bring out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, we also own Estonians: starting with NOęP and they can be read in a whole row.
In reality, this known name concentration is very high," he says.
Take a longer look at the evening newspaper video!
Audit updates the rating of car manufacturers in the middle of the criticism of up to 850 000 diesel vehicles
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it would provide software upgrades to more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the BMW chairman, the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than travel restrictions", referring to European cities, including the BMW home town, Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday Daimler announced that it would renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
None of the companies described these operations as a setback.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
It also increases the cost of equipment to be installed for the neutralisation of diesel emissions for automotive companies, making it difficult to keep car prices competitive.
At the same time as the German car manufacturers are subject to a thorough investigation, the Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of being abused by powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring the particular signs referring to the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen errors, which were silent about the use of so-called fraud devices, which allowed for the adjustment of exhaust gas emissions to comply with the regulations during the test of the car, but were withdrawn in normal driving conditions.
A number of Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are both under investigation in the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics unit of the Audi engine development unit was arrested in Germany.
Former President, Zacheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may go to trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was brought into criminal investigations in Germany on Volkswagen when the authorities accused the Audi of installing the system to circumvent Europe's exhaust emissions requirements by extending the investigation that had previously been focused on the United States.
The involvement of the audit in the investigation can be a major boost to Volkswagen by the manufacturer of luxury cars generating a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen’s profits.
Estonian schools will receive 20 000 euros of European Union tickets.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy European Union flags to Estonian schools by 1 September.
A total of 105x158 centimeters of the European Union's 570 educational institutions will receive the European Union's flag.
The flags are intended for exploitation in indoors, they must be carried out in high-quality printing equipment in indoor spaces with tunnel tension, transmits the ERR news portal.
The flagvarda label has the text: "The Estonian Schools for the first presidency of the Council of the Estonian Union.
The estimated cost of 570 tickets is €20,000 for the Ministry of Education, which means one ticket costs €35.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes the growing threat situation in Mexico
The workers of Riodoce magazine usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the Sinalo state, which are sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and uninterrupted drug wars.
But today they are gathered in the shadow of personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They're told it's important to change their routines.
Two senior writers will discuss which seems safer: either bring the children to an office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on the table at the front of the room: 'necessaries', ' neutral', 'the allies'.
They ask reporters for the names of each column to provide evidence is not necessary, with the impressions and inner feelings sufficient.
Being paid by government or cartels is suspected of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists having a full list of evils that make the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
The majority of these journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, have been vanquished since the appointment of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 by at least 25,589 journalists, following attacks and threats under national protection, have been killed for at least seven journalists in seven states.
The latter are their editor and source of inspiration, the donor of Riodoce in Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The worst mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug abuse.
His absence gives a deep feeling, although his presence on the fascist of the Riodoce building hangs a big picture of the mid-finger Valdez with the letter "Justness" and two 30th reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry the T-shirts, which are portrayed with his smiling glasses on his face or his typical Panama bar.
The meeting will take place less than two months after he died. Reporters will discuss a common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although two cases were created to deal with journalists' cases in 2010, only two cases have been brought under judicial responsibility as reported by the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
As in most annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders, which range from thousands to thousands, journalists rarely get to trial.
Riodoce continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the meeting on security without the details and justice of the killers, there is no great deal of benefit.
"It's stupid to waste his time here at the meeting," he says.
"Until the cause is known, you'll be sure to trust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the capital of the state in the morning of May 15.
He only managed to drive a couple of blocks before two men stopped him from the red Toyota Corla, forced him out of the car and shot him 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name, which means "twelfth of the river".
A man who was armed drove off in Valdez's car and made an accident near it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left behind by a woman and two grown-up children.
The rumors are spreading freely in Culiacan.
However, only silence prevails mainly on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and issued to the United States in January, Sinalo has been one of the most bloody combat powers in the country, because rivallized clicks are fighting over a power vacuum.
No matter how many people, or even many, die every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is full of well - decorated, double - kings of drugs, which are larger than the homes of many living.
Let us forget for a moment that the time of peace refers to how valuable ports and drug routes to the United States can only lead one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers involved in his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60) is aware of the fact that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes there were two mistakes that encouraged him to kill.
The first of them was the publication of an interview with a man from Damascus Lopez, who was competing with Guzman's sons, who was at war and who was at war.
This copy of the book could have been bought by suspected gang members as soon as they arrived in the newspapers.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after the raid took place in one of the newspapers that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and killing him is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he was always there.
He worked as a veteran reporter for the newspaper Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloas was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem.
In time, the newspaper gathered its reputation with bold and honest reflections and increased sales and advertising.
The reporters liked to publish strong studies without fear of the censorship and readers in a firm edition of which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won its Latin American reflectors for the prestiige Maria Moors Cabot Prize.
In the same year Valdez, the Valdez Journalists' Defence Committee (AKK) won the prize for international freedom of the press for his courage to follow Mexican drug history wherever it leads.
He admitted openly that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said with the AKK prize.
Last October, he told the television station Rompevito's TV interview that trafficking in drugs is a way of life in Sinalo.
"You have to take on the task of the journalistic office with another chance to play dumb.
I don't want to be asked what I did when faced with so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on."
Riodoce's collective misses Valdez, a joker who, like the madman, was a friend who kindly shared the embassies and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported her routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to the bar in El Guayabo, and he was always sitting at the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love became fatal to him.
His death has also made them doubt how to do their job best and to stay alive.
"They don't like to see you as a rabbit with these women, their children, their legitimate business, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"It was not necessary to touch those things," Bojorquez said.
Even in the best times, self - control and self - control are the result.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to the editor of Riodoce, Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that Sinaloas no longer has old rules, exactly as they do not apply to the toxic composition of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros, or other states that are home to the productive smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt public officials.
The landscape changes all the time.
In the space where Riodoce staff met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was discovered that only the spy goods sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers were looking for a relief from the 40-mile heat in the shadow of the tree.
The government assigned them to guard Riodoce's office, located in a four-storey building in the middle class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered whether those policemen were one of the 50 percent policemen whose governor himself had made an unbelief impression.
Several months have passed since reporters drove to mountain areas where control is held by de facto narcotics.
Riodoce’s publication this week dealt with three main stories.
One of them was the murder of a former boxer, Julio Caesar Chavez's brother in Sinalo.
They also had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official statement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it had to be cautious when it was time to write what everyone in town knew about the restaurant is both a place of concern for drug dealers and the authorities.
Reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant is registered to the name of a politician who is a member of the institutional revolution industry (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the previous century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in cases of widespread echoation.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at the same location, including how the son of Guzman, who wore the nickname El Chapo, escaped from military forces.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have looked for Valdez column to get information about kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have already known what happened," said the 46-year-old Villarreal, whose dressy body design has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels are broken with our sources."
Valdez's office has become a storage facility for signs and stickers that protest against the murder of journalists, and the inaction staff have become something they never expected to expect activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few tags and went to the local prosecutor's office next morning for a demonstration of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the West of Michigan.
The body was found burned and the officials said it belongs to him on DNA tests.
Journalists have become more pronounced across the country and criticise "SOS press" as an organised protest on the walkways and buildings.
On that day, Mr Bojorquez will be away in Washington, trying to collect international support to establish justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez was killed by Governor Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because of telling the truth.
After that, he asked that he be diverted from the government to other parts of his activities, concerned that his anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are "limited" by organised crime, fellow state officials and an independent society.
In his last book "Pharmaceutical literature" he wrote that reporters not only kill drugs, but also do so under the command of politicians and security forces who are in a state of organised crime.
In the past year, Articulo 19 was dedicated more than half of the journalists’ attacks to police and public officials.
"You die in a Mexican, because you're wanted to be silenced," said Ramirez.
Murders obviously have a bloody effect.
Nobody forgets the death of a blogja, Maria Elizabeth Macias, in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter that was probably signed by a cartel in Los Zeta: "I'm here because of my reports."
The computer keyboard and the headphones were lying next to the head cut off.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, for example, the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihua, after the killing of their Correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others will pass on as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their leader in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke to drug cartels with a guide entitled "What do you want from us?".
Some journalists have lost their country or even their country.
It's a mermaid decision.
It's hard to find work in Exile, and they still have to hide the streets to avoid danger.
And sometimes, they will be brought back, as probably happened with the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in 2015 at one of Mexico's apartments three months after he left Veracruz.
Those who stay put and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, acknowledges that he was frightened by the cover of the drug business.
"Mexico's on his way to hell, and that's why I started reporting," he said.
At the middle of a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodoce's editors were sitting in front of the office on the sidewalk and crawled beer when they suddenly started vibrating all the phones.
In Mazatlan, the coastal resort town, 19 people were killed by confirmed data in the exchange of fires between rival forces and security forces.
War continued to deteriorate, as promised by various cartels found in the region.
On the same side of the walk, reporters put news on the Riodoce website using their mobile phone.
The first day of the day needed a change.
The sirens swept another fire in the area.
Bojorquez's hiding with the police guard to see if they're alert.
If they were afraid, they didn't show it at least.
Under the massive portrait of the founder of the newspaper, which shows his average finger on all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's employees delivered his tracks.
"How can I even think about closing down," said Bojorquez, "when the day Javier was killed, the trainee asked me to send him to the streets to report?"
Dinosaurus used a protective color to prevent enemies
At first sight, it looks like a figure, though pretty scary.
Scientists have now released the first findings of the Canadian miner's discovered the incredibly large nature of the nostril, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of the Indiosaurs".
It's almost so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that the skin covered with its veins was redish brown color and his past had been somewhat "hard".
The report in Current Biology magazine described the essence as "the best preserved soloistosaur that has ever been found" and as "one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
Fossil is a new nodosaurus type that lived in the middle of the critical age 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation of open scientists who describe it as "very significant".
According to the National Geographic magazine, this warmed vegetable is the best preserved of this type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was found on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk, when he mined the Suncor Millennial mine near Fort McMurray in North Albertas Canada.
He hit something that didn't recall the surrounding stone, and decided to study more closely.
The detected fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The next six years were worked on digging an animal out of 2500 pounds [100 kg] of land.
After all this hard work, the outcome is now finally ready to bring the public before the end.
"If a little eyed out, you can almost believe that he is sleeping," said the leading author, Caleb Brown, researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It's going to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur seisena - dinosaur Mona Lisa."
By examining his skin, scientists found that this plant eater, although covered with suctions and recalled the walking tank, was likely to be significantly threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
This rich dinosaur used a red and white protective color to hide from predators and applied a shadowing technique called resistance, and it also used many animals today.
According to experts, dinosaurs were better placed in the vicinity and prevented enemies, as larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt for him.
This being of the 11 million - year - old Nodosaur family reached the news for the first time in May and is now being visited at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now studied and named it Borealop from the markmitchell Museum according to Mark Mitchell, who belonged to a team that made the animal difficult to reveal more than 7,000 hours.
Thanks to the amazingly good maintenance of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the bowels in the body.
They discovered the method of protection that was spread in the animal kingdom, which means that the top half of the creature was darker than the lower half.
Although the resistance has spread, the bread will come as a surprise, since Borealopta is far greater than the animals living in countersurgents today.
This suggests that dinosaurs were sufficiently active in hunting other carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favoured abstinence instead of a survival act.
However, most animals using modern counter-surgeons, such as deer, zebras or achids, are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, which suggests that the nodosaurus had to really work to survive.
"The strong hunting of a dinosaur covered with a huge and numerous favors shows how dangerous it may have been for the crippling dinosaurs of the critical age," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of progeny organic compounds also revealed that dinosaur skin was a redpox.
Scientists will continue to study the animal to get clues to this life, including the remaining contents of the intestine, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river, thereby reaching the sea with the current, where he fell to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and the rivers and oceans are likely to extend far beyond the internal land.
"This nodosaur is truly significant, because it is fully covered with preserved soft skin, while it has remained three-dimensional, maintaining the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as the critic age.
You don't have to use a lot of imagination to renovate it -- it's just enough to tear your eyes out, and it seems like she's asleep."
The critical age was the time when the vast two-legged carnivorous dinosaurs, teropoids, were on Earth’s feet.
Although all of these King Tyrannosaurus’ Rex lived millions of years later than Borealop, it was a popular dinosaur to hunt some of his frightening predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 metres) long and six tons of monster.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in Current Biology, believe that Borelopta was threatened after death in the sea and that mummification in the mud.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the existence when he mined the Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in North Albertas Canada.
According to the museum, it has been best preserved in the salt-densoro in the world, including skin and bowels, and it is a complete conic to the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five metres) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20 inches of barley came out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this plant-eater, covered with swamps, went through the present West Canada until the flooded river threatened it into the open sea.
However, the seaside burial site of dinosaur helped to maintain its well - being in detail.
The stoned remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skulls of mygarous suction plates along the dinosaur’s skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the magazine National Geographic: "The present degree of maintenance is as rare as the lottery butter.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
Excessed skin remains are still covered by mygarous suction plates on the animal skull.
The right front leg rests beside him, and five toes are stretched upwards.
"I have the opportunity to count the favors on his feet."
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Who do they thank?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a complete shock.
The only day after the trip to New York, it sat on Facebook on the phone in a room rented through St. Louis's resident Airbnb.
He went to his former schoolmate's post.
It says, "Politsei just killed an 18-year-old kid, and he's still resting on the street."
He was confused why no one else had posted this information in his voo, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
With the length @TheePharoah user Posts were repeatedly distributed in his timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis was a real-time delivery of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's living body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," said Ferrell himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He hung up on his phone, but later on, he saw a new set of people this time on Canfield Drive.
They shared photos of the police tape and screaming people and the man who said he was Brown's father and yet kept it in "Ferguson's police just killed my non-armed son!"
He looked at the current in real time, where the police stood before a group of protesters with a hatchling dog.
In the second video, another cop, he said, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
Ferrelli remembers how he hit himself with the thought, "It's unusual."
"It's not the kind of murder we're used to and what we might call typical."
I used to feel a lot of nightmares at the moment.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After landing at 23 p.m., his father went after his six - year - old daughter and decided that they would drive the two of Ferguson next morning.
What happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson in the next three years is the central theme in the new documentary "Whose Street?" ("Who thanks?" which premieres in the cinema on 11 August.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and perseverance of the sight of those living in this community and who fulfilled the answers in demand.
When Ferrell and his daughter, who had a flower dress and had a suitable crown for Ferguson, they again discussed a subject that had been discussed several times before this morning, about the experience and the conditions of life of black men.
"Do you remember when I taught you how to fight for your rights?" he recalls asking himself.
"We're driving Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't take her with me," said Ferrell later.
"What's happening right now is... a cult in the past.
He needs to know and see and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activism and organisation, and at the same time feel the different layers of black experience and living conditions, and what we need to do to get free and free ourselves.
Even if I succeed in raising him so that he does not personally experience the depraved racism, he does not differ from another black girl.
I feel like I'd make her feel like I'd be protecting her from this world."
The first stop they made when Ferguson arrived was on the South Florissat station in a place that had become a certain kind of camp site where activists were waiting for news of Officer Darren Wilson, who was not finally charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with the local business owner who made lunches.
They put food bags together and helped them distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrelli, he started slowly taking the shape of a new type of activation.
"My activity changed completely after 9 August," he said, stating that when he was Missouri-St. Louis University student, he was the president of the Association of Minors of Teachers and focused on inequalities in food justice and health in black communities.
"I had no organisation experience.
It's all just a lavage."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with a co-director of the film Sabah Folayan during his evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and the film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrararr just wanted to document what was happening.
Ferrelli asked me, "Are you trying to document what's going on or find a story that can be used?"
Such scepticism was due to countless cases in which people - often white - come into the community and try to reap the benefits of its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in the recent interview: "We heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson was not heard, and we wanted to do so differently."
Folayan had already struck hands with the co-chair of Damon Davis, an artist in the region known for the activism in relation to the prisoners who were sentenced to death.
His involvement turned the project into a tie to Ferrelli and another six other locals who were watched by the team in "Whose Street?" after Brown was shot for years.
"In this documentary, no one talks for us or with us, but we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
"It was important for me to see how these people are being pictured, because that's how I'm being pictured."
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrelli's experience, it would be to show that the movement is not 'in the lead, but in the assembly of the community', as Folayan said, he became the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Street?" is documenting surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as love and marriage to his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing over the first time he saw a sheet of linen.
"But I realized that this work and the humanization of black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
Furthermore, Ferrelli's story highlights and re-emphasises the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three beginners who thought about social media in 2012 after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin out of the theme reference #BlackLivesMatter are homosexual.
"The leading role of black homosexual women has been holding the movement globally," Ferrell said, "and that is precisely because we have to keep on fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women must bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed, stating that "the movement really keeps black women alive, and many of them are black homosexual women".
He also claims that "this is no type of equal opportunity" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the center of the film because of his identity.
"He was the person who had the right energy," he said.
"But it's not a coincidence that he was right on the front line because as a black homosexual woman, there's a lot of weight living in such nodes.
His energy can be realized through the screen."
At the same time, news cameras from Ferguson have long disappeared, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The penalty imposed on Ferrelli during his demonstration of intent for blocking the road will be another 2.5 years.
He describes the social political atmosphere in the region he calls home, just a "superbest thing".
However, he still considers it important for the mantra he has eaten since he went to Ferguson's streets three years ago.
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing but our chains."
7 nipples of how to get over the basic after the Weekly party
A few more powerful male sons will find a party after the sunset, so that it may be helpful.
Or they're based on the expression "the bonfire, the constant drunk."
But it's just an inevitable delay and a proper strain on health.
What can you do to make it as painfully as possible after today and tomorrow's Weekly Trall or any other party - feel better in the morning and get over it?
Drink water.
Alcohol down and down, after a big party in the morning... or, if possible, instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of liquid when drinking alcohol, it has to be returned somehow.
In combination with water, mineral materials are poured out of the body, and so it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritable after the urination, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or just slightly glazed.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure that won't cost a bug to get his grandmother to break trees - it could be a fateful false decision.
But a mild walk helps the body to remember what it feels like to be alive again.
Landing and laying the ground is a more time-consuming way of healing.
Give the body back energy slowly and carefully.
If you're already on the run yesterday, I'm sure you don't want to try to load a big fat steak.
Start with fresh juice, for example, where the fruit sugars are contained in your body’s quiet to shake.
If you are already suffering from health in the south, you might want to try a broth, for example.
And a little later on.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretics will release your body from the final water.
As I have already said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller tonight to prevent painkillers, your liver will have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and will lose performance.
That's how you're gonna ruin your liver even more, and there's a lot worse in the future.
In addition, painkillers do not last much longer in the body.
If you take the painkiller in the morning, don't do it in an empty stomach - it'll upset you'll already be a dirty stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you'll get along well with yourself.
It's about as good as walking, but walking can't get orgasms.
However, avoid being too active and twisted at the time of the boxing - the physical effort should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding me.
Talk stupid to friends and friends, do simple stupid things, and laugh friendlyly over yourself and the others.
A joke and a laughter may not drive away the hanger, but it will certainly be more fun to tolerate the consequences.
One time, it's going through the bottom anyway!
Professor Northwest and employee at Oxford University are being searched for suspected murder.
According to the police, a nationwide search is made for professor at Northwest University and an employee at Oxford University who has been suspected of having found a male body with fatal stab wounds from one of Chicago's luxury housing.
According to Cook County's case-law, on Monday, the order of arrest for 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were issued indicted for the murder of the first degree due to their alleged connection with the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Durunleau.
According to the documentation, the 26-year-old Cornell-Durunleau died after repeated injection.
According to the warning that the Chicago Police Department issued to the community, the body was discovered on July 27, was discovered.
The cops received a phone call and found a victim in Grand Plaza's apartment building who had multiple stab wounds on his body.
According to the officials, the Cornell-Durunleau scene was declared dead, and the investigators are talking about being stabbed as murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a co-sponsor of microbiology and immunology at Northwest University since 2007.
The vice-president of public relations at the University, Alan K. Cubbage, said in his e-mail statement that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from work and has been banned from entering the cities of Northwest University.
"It is now the criminal case of the competent authorities, and the University of Northwest is working with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior massist at Oxford University's Financial Department.
An e-mail statement from the University and the Somerville College said: "We have been in contact with the British police and ready to assist U.S. research agencies in any way possible."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted to give up.
Anthony Guglimiste, head of the Chicago Police Department's communication department, strongly advises suspects to turn themselves over to the authorities.
"The police have an idea where they are, but we are dealing with a more intensive definition of the exact location," said Guglimi.
According to Guglimi, the local, regional and national authorities will help search for suspects.
Guglimiste said that the police received a phone call from the owner of the Grand Plaza apartment building who had just received a cryptic hint that there was something going on in the apartment no. 1008.
According to the police description, this was a magical sight.
According to Guglidel, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's stay in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," added Guglimimimi.
The Grand Plaza Management sent a letter to the residents: "It is currently working to identify events in the field of chromology and victim background, and to examine various motives, including the possibility that this was a family seat."
Businesses that help your company avoid becoming Uber next.
Amy said she wanted to measure the satisfaction of her employees at her start-up e-commerce company, but the polls were unprofitable.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, he did not trust some employees in this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Erert, who, with 75 employees in San Francisco, led by an e-commerce company selling hair care products from Madison Reed.
So he called outside people.
New types of human resources start-ups are important, helping companies find out what their employees are feeling.
By developing and licenseing software with a strong aim of measuring employee involvement, companies will be able to conduct sudden interviews, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer workers anonymousness and hotline complaints and, in some cases, allow language carriers to go along the C-level management and directly to the management board.
"Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, an assistant and CEO of Redwood City, Glint, whose software analysts use companies to measure employee involvement.
However, he said that he has received a much better overview of what his employees think and feel over three years.
In addition to sudden research and specific teams, it offers a company's thermal map, which provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to identify the reasons.
Companies have begun to realize that they need to remain aware of their working culture so that they do not become the next Uber, which has been inflamed to scandals since the former employee published a blog mailing that described a distressing environment, where those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups like Glen, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation and compliance may be above USD 118.7 billion according to the Let's Talk Payments data on the financial technology statistics website by 2020.
In Denver Colorado, the start company Convertcent, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, observed this year the suspicious reputation of Uber in the background of interest and activity growth.
The Convertcent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
As Glintki, Convertcent lets companies send customized pulse interviews, collect real-time confidential answers and watch thermal maps from problematic areas.
It also offers an anonymous communication line that allows workers to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when the CEO comes in, the complaints go straight to the board.
"The public opinion has been acclaimed by the regulatory authorities," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the Convercent.
Quinlan said that if it is found that the company treats its employees badly or behaves unintendedly, the company may face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, workers' departures and cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 sites, has used the Convercent more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and activities and offer an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the company’s headquarters’s telephone number or e-mail address, file an official complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously.
This was a frequent and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday's general advisor James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to follow employee complaints.
However, now that the company is using the Convercent, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices are possible, which did not reach the leaders who had previously worked in offices in other cities or states, to identify and deal with them more quickly.
"I can get closer to the hollicidal 360 degree experience of workers," said Vitrano, who is running Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Team.
"And we will protect our shareholders from legal disputes with employees."
Quinlan said that companies started taking ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, i.e. after Arthur Andersen fell due to ethical violations in connection with Enron's scandal.
But only when "the social media became mature", companies realized that they could not prevent their black wash from being washed publicly online.
"before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity for venture capital investors to have supported both start-ups.
In February, the Convercent financed $10 million by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, increasing the value of the capital collected by it to 47 million.
Glint invested $10 million in the Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments will not be as a surprise to take into account the link between companies, culture and venture capital.
More research shows that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
Competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, have high wages and interesting projects that are just on the table.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy in the company, they feel that they are being listened to and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of the staff's experience in LinkedIn, which uses both the Convertent and the Glent.
Investors earn income if their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and involved.
If the third party analytical tools allow increased employee commitment and involvement, it is no wonder that they will find support.
It is important, according to the experts of the workplace, to have data on the involvement of workers.
But these data are useless if the company's supervisors don't start anything on them.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that changes will be expected.
And if changes do not take place quickly enough or at all, this can lead to disappointment and reduced employee involvement.
"If you ask 4,000 proposals, you must be ready for 4000 conversations," said Kutter International President Russell Raath, who has seen how companies make mistakes by relying on too many data collections.
'Cause if things don't end, the employees will think, 'Did you really take me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to the report, Madison Reed, who is now conducting six studies among employees, has been able to implement the measures on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glent.
And after getting feedback from employees who were disappointed in decision-making speeds and quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and offer communication training to deal with the problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, collects new data on employees and hopes that in the long term it will lead to a longer-term commitment of workers in the industry, known for the volatility of their large workforce.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies."
The star of the euro area is Baltic: incomes are growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have affected the Baltic Sea, the three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries in Western Europe, Bloomberg refers to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the central bank, since 1999, total economic output per person has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
There is a low debt burden behind success, a rapid improvement of institutions and a business and free market policy.
"Balt countries with Slovakia are among the few euro area countries where the real SCP per capita purchasing power is significantly closer to the EU average", the central bank reported.
Although the objective is to make total economic output more equal to that of Western Europe, in 2015 the average of only 2/3 of the 15 countries of the Baltic economies per capita, which were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement process.
Low wages have led the Baltics to look for better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, local residents are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvian and Lithuanian residents estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, it was slightly less than half of the surveyed economies in their countries.
The decision of the NCAA to cancel the trainings taking place twice a day makes Bruins' days long
It's almost 23, when the trobby UCLA football clubs stop at the edge of the new training field located in the team's campus.
Some of them have peeled off their backs by exposing their first day of training camp effort to sweat their backs.
For a large part of the team, these forces offer a midday break.
In summer courses, players will head back from three hours to study for the final exams in the joints before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings next morning at 6.30 p.m.
"The next three days are a real challenge for them," said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The decision of the NCAA to cancel the practice of reducing the burden of players twice a day has actually made their days longer - at least until the end exams reach one side on Friday.
For this reason UCLA’s first three trainings were scheduled to start at 19.15 to fit players into a already tight schedule.
The transition from two trainings a day means more than one exercise days - the start of the Bruins training camp was increased in comparison with the previous season almost a week forward and for the first time in Mora's six Westwood season will take place during summer courses.
They have until 20 August scheduled 18 training sessions before officially preparing for the opening of September against Texas A&M.
According to Mora, he is in favour of the changes in the NCAA regulation, although it adds one more item to the tight charts of players.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days, and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they will break themselves through this trial; and they will make effort, and they will be fine young.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it will be really nice."
Once the camp is completed, UCLA's trainings will become closed, which is not a simple task, given a clear view of the nearby parking lot and the adjacent centre of Luskini, from a higher-class hotel that has already been hit by football which has already escaped from the network of defences around the gate.
From this weekend, the Hotel Bruins players are calling, but Mora admitted that problems may arise during the season with free rooms.
"We'll put security in place," said Mora.
"This is a real place of concern, and it is not excessive to think that people can rent a room and watch training there.
If you have a record of training, it could be a pretty good deal.
But we'll use a security team there and on the 8th parking lot.
We do our best by using the existing ones.
I'm trying not to worry about it.
We have a plan in place."
In return for duty to the Central County Electoral Union of Savisaare-Ivanova, Kristiina Ojuland, who has been deported from the Reformative Society, and to the EKRE in connection with the forces of Maria Kaljuste who have been forced to leave, our Tallinn and party election association, Tegus Tallinn - seems to be taking part in the election of the elected party-makers' initiative, at least as much as the political parties, this year's local elections.
The chicks will, however, be considered in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointments for all of them.
Who's staying with Savisaar?
If Edgar Savosaare’s sponsorship has fallen small, it may not be the case for events organised by his electoral union.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current middlemen and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And is there any reason why some Savisaare’s loyal followers and friends are dissatisfied from being applied in Tallinn, looking for a list of perpetrators in the 'Savisaari', whose lead is corrupts and suspected of corruption crimes, becoming real?
The music video on the roof of the city council filmed in Russian-speaking populus, involving the senior of Lasnamäe’s district; and in every sense the original computer game, in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must avoid the noises and squirrels of the 16- and 17-year-old voters on the road?
We look forward to the idea of a youthful election campaign by other parties.
If the Channel 2 or TV3 viewers look against the black square from the beginning of August, there will be two options: agree that only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English France24 channels will be seen in the future, or will be given to some television operators every month.
There are probably also those who are happy at the beginning of the commercial-free television experience, but eventually, although opposedly, they pay for TV and advertising.
The music singing, the loud people and the trash left on the streets are almost unpleasant side effects of every major music festival.
If you don't want to be part of the noise yourself, you should go to the country instead of the pain in your home to find out, and leave the sleeping spot for the festival halls for the amount.
Washington changes the green card rules
Media publications quote President Donald Trump, who said there is a new American immigration plan that will change the green card rules.
The plan provides for a reduction of the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, more stringent rules for obtaining temporary working methods and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The bill goes to Congress for discussion in two chambers.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers' money because it changes the way the US delivers green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce the chain migration and will replace the current programme.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and have financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said according to US media publications.
The Siberian Seto young people move into town, the pensioners return to the country.
Jevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the once famous set of gold miners along the Maana River.
He works 140 kilometers from home as a driver in a gold cartel near the Maana Additional River Image.
It is hard work: two months in a row without holiday days for 12 hours of work and then only ten days at home and again.
Anatoli has only seen gold once in three years worked at the Artelli.
"There is a hard time: going in thoroughly to check that the wine is not brought, and going out so that the gold is not taken," says Anatoli.
Mare Piho, in the village of Haida, is talking to the local seto Jan, who has told him a lot about his family's memories in Siberia.
The still preserved archaeological culture of Siberian Setotes will also affect home-sets, as it is simply so amazing, thinks the most far-reaching setes of Piho Mare studied.
His first trip to Siberia will last for 30 years this year.
During that time, he's been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many setts still traveled to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to become the land here?
That's an unsolved question.
I say 8,000.
I've calculated it according to Siberian set men's stories, who's thought about it.
It's hard to say exactly, because there could be up to 30 people in one group at that time, but the passport was only given to the man.
The passport was only given to one, but he had children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look how big this territory was here!
It was many times larger than the historic Setomaa.
It had to be educated, managed in some way.
Setets came here as peasants, but their lives changed because here they came to regions that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (charging), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Peter, many sets later went to work in the classified city of Krasnojarsk-45 (the Soviet power was built by the uranium plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the sets then represent a majority of the population in this region?
Yeah, they lived in a compact way.
In addition, the tradition of getting married was long preserved, and many children were born.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How different is Siberian Seto culture and different from the mother country’s Seto?
They're different, even though what was brought here was never the same.
They brought a lot of folk clothes.
They did so themselves (comforts), but they always made the difference that was brought with them and what was done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional clothing of settos, because it is colder here.
Food changed.
For example, in Setoma, meat was salted, but it was just frozen here.

The motherland of the communication was spiritually strong; it was considered to be very important.
It seems to me now that it is going to give back to Setumaa, it will affect them.
Those girls who have lived here in families have been listening to amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to visit Haiti at the beginning of July for the day of Seto Kingdom and lived four days at home - J. P.
What's left here is amazing.
"It is extremely easy to come and go, as the city has a great place to live: at a railway point and at a road crossing," says Reigo Tamm, an operaist from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military town, we have a lot of nature, sports and culture, and pizza is available at every corner.
Kill's a top stop town!
There's a small island near the White River running through the city where killers usually hold a Japanese party.
"This beautiful place in the train window doesn't look like it," says Reigo.
Anyone who is not afraid of cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of resources.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
On the river's water, you can hold a picnic and just make romance - you can look at the river's flow and think back and forth.
I've been out there walking with my girlfriends.
The Operaisian Tamm has been on the river other than the three bridges to practice his treasures, saying, "That this place is near town, no one may ever come back to the face of their own stories."
"A wonderful view is open from the hill to the Tapa, but there are also health lines where you can run, ski in winter, and now, for example, the discolf play - a golf course has been made, disks can be borrowed from the sports centre", directs Reigo.
I mean, old professionals go there with their disks, but I haven't been able to play there yet.
It is probably necessary to invite my colleague Rasmus Kull Tape to visit, because he has experienced a discgolfi player and has disks.
He's gonna lend me!
Reigo and Männikägi were inseparable at the time of their childhood.
At least during the gymnastics.
There are many tears left on this mountain, disappointments, and you can enjoy my sports life.
Not to mention broken coils and skis.
"The central town is now full of construction works, all this becomes unknown," says Reigo.
Kill the old and tired blind house, however, is a very attractive place to play summer matches.
I'm glad that in 2012 R.A.A.A. Mi Director Märt Meos accepted my idea and my theatre came to make a blind summer theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with "Alexei Karenin" was just over, on August 11, the railway station has "Electrication" when the old blind house is moving around in the 1980s.
"From 11 to 13 August, the city of Tapa is the days of which, in addition to the opening of the blind hall building, have been awakened and a series of cultural events, including the folk race", Reigo, who suggests to visit the city of 91 years in those days.
In a small yellow house, on May 1st, the museum has since 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibit is very much and information enormously", says Reigo, which is filled with the history of the city of Tapa, the majority of which focuses on rail and military.
Reigo recalls that, when Killer goes through all the recommended places, the stomach is going to be empty on the long end, but fortunately, the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good meals and we sometimes get the feeling that you're abroad", he describes.
The trained and young soldiers who have come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs, so sitting there is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but around you there are such an international society together.
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we've got a lot going on!
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
On TV, bTV was quoted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who announced that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
In the morning of August 1, the police arrested the Sithonia Peninsula group, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but there's an investigation now.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV station BTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing severe fines for all who are not in a place where rest is missed.
Controls continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Dogs teach wolves to break sheep.
After a year, the Hiiumaa farmers have to give the wolves a "training material" from their herd - the wolves who probably taught the puppy have already broken a lot of sheep.
This year the wolves in Hiiu county have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, says Hiiu Leht.
I only had the corresponding number three, the year before 124.
The environmental agency’s data on the fractured sync also show that the soil’s Hiiumaal huts were not born and that information from the Hiiumaa Antiquities Council that this year there are two wolves units fixed on the island.
The night against Monday, the wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna, the village of Emmaste, and injured 18 surviving sheep.
In the morning of Wednesday, wolves broke the village of Rehesselja in the pasture of the village of the village of Rehesselja, and seriously injured one of you who had to commit an emergency.
Rules for the management of genetically modified crops shall be clear.
The Ministry of Agriculture sent a draft legislation amending the legislation on the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOVS) and the Act on the Protection of Plant Protection.
The amendment of the law will give up the creation of a separate data collection for both genetically modified crops (GM) and operators, which will then be used in the plant health register.
In addition, GM changes the obligation of a crop operator to have a prior agreement with a man in the field of beekeeping.
Although genetically modified crops are currently not grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the compilation of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least until it was decided to declare Estonia GMOs free," said Sigmar Suu, Chairman of the Department of Plant Health of the Ministry of Agriculture.
"It must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account both the costs and administrative burden for the private and public sectors", added Suu.
The draft legislation repeals provisions relating to the dataset and the training of farmers in GMOs, as well as the management training of GMOs, lays down requirements for the management of the crop and for the start-up of economic activities.
In particular, as regards beekeeping, GM growers are hereby replaced by the obligation to inform beekeepers of the obligation to reach an agreement with bee before cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to examine the draft information system and, if so, to submit their views to the Ministry of Agriculture.
The proposed changes will affect in particular those active in the field of plant production, beekeeping and the Office of Agriculture.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize MON 810.
Until then, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in the cultivation of GM crops.
The reason is that there are no corn pests in Estonia, a European stalker that is resistant to maize MON 810.
Its varieties have also been developed for the southern regions, and it is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Agriculture has commissioned studies to detect contamination with possible GM organisms in the seeds of various suviraps, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia.
The results of the analyses of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain alien genes and as a result of the study it was concluded that seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that there are no consciously genetically modified crops in Estonia and that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruit Nemanja Maticu in the form of "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has recruited Nemanja Matic in the face of "genius" after the midfield player Sampdor against Wednesday night in his debut.
For 40 million pounds of Chelsea, the player who was bought from Dublin began the last season before Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid in a first round of 2-1 wins on Tuesday, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on the raids.
However, having missed the long-term Asian tour of Blues, Maticul remained in need of a match for only 45 minutes, according to Mourinho, to make sure that the Premier League season should be improved.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he's got the style of football," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him achieve the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, others began in the beginning of Aviva stadium, recruiting Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku and Mourinho began to place their eleven initial men at the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho would still like to recruit three football players, but he confirmed that the club has already done "great work" by concluding agreements with three of his four priority choices.
"I'm grateful to the club for being able to realize three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another son of a bitch was hit by a GSM escort on August 1st and this time in Muhus.
According to Mati Martinson, a live bird watcher in Sõrves was first equipped with a homeboy, and this nest is already flying around, has left the nest and joined a large pool of Mullutu-Súrlah nights.
This is because Sõrves is not a crop field, says the Island Sound.
On this Tuesday, a relatively late ringing of the throats, another sore son of a bitch, and this one on the island of Muhu.
Martinson said that installing transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
I was equipped with a sorcerer named Mati GSM escort in Sõrves Tõrkel.
"His work on the Internet is all viewed as: how he was wintering in Spain, coming back a long time at the German and Polish border, and then came to Saaremaa", Martinson spoke.
The British inventor was able to install a microchip in his body to get into the house and car with a handbag.
The inventor of Britain became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could simply open his front with a hand-brake, get into the office and even start the car.
33-year-old Steven Northam was able to install a tiny chip between his thumb and finger and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who wish to make their lives easier with technology.
He has combined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, the Royal Hospital of Hampshire, Hansit, to ensure that the installation procedure is compatible with the medical standards.
The technology is similar to that used for cats and dogs, and only 30 seconds is required for the procedure.
The Northami company also replaces the locks of houses and cars to match the chip, asking 300 pounds for a lock.
This married child’s father has now installed technology at home and in his car BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House Expoate went to pay the taxpayers thousands of dollars.
According to TIMME published military documents, the White House's decision to land a marine helicopter for an American production event in the previous month went to pay almost 24 000 dollars to the south-west taxpayers.
The green and white color Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, who was on board the president, was the central image number of the event that took place in the White House on 17 July.
The senior officials of President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and the White House, renewed industrial products from all 50 states on their tour.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exposed together with the hunting from Maine, the fire-fighting truck from Wisconsin and the hand-knive-knit-knit-knit-knit-knit-knit-knit-knit.
According to the documentation of the eskaar Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) responsible for the operation of Helicopter, the presence of the White House military chamber in the helicopter was required by a partial order, i.e. FARGO, almost 36 hours before landing in the south of the helicopter's "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this, because it is an unusually significant event," said HMX-1 commander day before the event in e-mail to his superior, the Deputy Officer of the Navy in the field of aviation.
The mission indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the south yard at 7 a.m. on 17 July at 15 a.m. and remain there until the yard is cleared between 18 and 21 o'clock the same evening.
The fact that if leaving the White House was to be present was added, a second ekipaa would be required to return to work due to restrictions on working time.
The initial flight crew was at the helicopter at the time of the event, and the Eskaar security team remained near the aircraft during the entire period of its stay on the ground.
The documents given to TIME in the magazine could not be read as to whether or not another ekipapaa finally needed or not.
The Hatchi Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event could break this provision.
"We asked if it broke Hatchi's law, and they told us not to break it," wrote the commander.
"It seems you have no choice," responded the chief officer.
White House declared the event "made in America" for an official event, and Hatchi's law would not have covered it.
But even official events have political altons.
The president supported the efforts made by the health reform at the Senate at that time and encouraged efforts to keep government regulations under control.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for political profit purposes is no new phenomenon.
Presidencies must be used to travel.
However, the requirement to use them as a purely photo session is unusual.
Trump came to the attention in February when, at his first campaign event in Florida, Melbourne, he rolled into the background of the president's plane, and his Twitter account is full of messages that complain about how his predecessor's president used the plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the exhibition "made in America", where products were represented from all 50 states made from American workers," said the White House press rapporteur, Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 teams often take auditions around Washington and the south yard to practice landings at the White House of the President of the United States of America with centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 held 58 auditions in the White House.
According to the official, the flight was assumed to be part of the flight standard of the flight crew's flight this month.
The Escaar helicopters flew for another 11 hours that day for non-president support missions.
According to the White House, none of the others charged this event in the tax collector’s wallet.
According to Sikorsky's representative, the company was not involved in the organisation of the helicopter's south-east exploitation.
HMX-1 does not maintain the President's budget documents and the exact costs of the event are difficult to identify.
However, the Ministry of Defence's annual annual prices for 2017 show that the VH-3D compensation rate is $24,380 per hour.
The Escaar documents indicated the length of the flight from its base fleet Quantico Airport for 30 minutes in both directions of Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount.
"The calculation of the cost of the payers based on estimated compensation rates is very misleading," said Walters.
"These estimated compensation rates include staff, maintenance and many other irreparable expenditure which will be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the RAND 2015 study, the Ministry of Defence’s compensation rates do not include personnel costs, although they cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
The former White House pressman, Sean Spider, protected the use of the helicopter at that time at the event.
"The idea is to show things made in America this week," said Spider.
"And I know that the State of Sikorsky and Connecticut is very proud of their contribution to our national security and that there are supposed to be hundreds if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe, exactly like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked hard on.
So, of course, it's right to highlight it."
It's not clear if Trump came into contact with or not with the helicopter in the southern court event, but he was sitting behind the wheel of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump Sikorsky approached representatives, making fun of media publications about company products in his personal aircraft park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - through tears arrived peace and joy
In 2011 MM Dékus hit Šadekoko in the last area, 800 m of running a pedestrian, and the milk was taken off from the stadium with a load.
Immediately before that, he had received zero in the distance cut of the universe in China.
In 2012, Helsingin’s EM wealthed the cheap damage, but at London’s debut Olympics, he was ranked 6013 by point 23.
However, the lack of luck continued.
After the opening day, 2013 in Moscow MM, Estonia's record schedule was provided with a remote injection of thumbs.
Two years later, he became the 15th place in Beijing’s MM, and he fulfilled the Olympic standard, but he had also wanted more of the athletes to be disappointed.
The hardest catalyst was passed by Šadeiko only on the soil if the EM at the beginning of Amsterdam did not receive the result of the distance cut.
I'd just like to put together one proper multi-competitive event once.
One time," sadeiko.
The worst was ahead: a month later, his Olympics broke out in Rio because of the thigh injury.
Is it time to take off - will it go on with the seven races?
Are two days of effort worth all of this?
She thought long, but she found peace.
I've had my head clean.
It's quite difficult to describe this experience, but I've been thinking that last season and Rio Olympia were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and think clean.
"I knew I wouldn't put the pill in the bag yet," says Šadeiko about his self-cleaning.
I've got a clean sheet to turn around and a new one to move on.
According to Coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the suffering of care, but she realized that the athlete had to be able to explain himself first and foremost.
I mean, he was so laid off by everybody.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit, however, said he wouldn't give up and he wants to prove what he's worth," says Mägi.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He'll be happy to.
The competition came back in May when Šadeiko set up a new Estonian record 6280 at the Gottzis Multi Competition.
At a high-level competition, he improved his personal peak position in a bullet point at about one metre (13.89) and ran a record-to-end obstacle.
Then, a multi-stakeholder felt that it was not a pool of abilities, but that it became just a first event in the race.
For years, Mägi, guided by him, says that Šadeiko is a pattern student.
He's a athlete. He's good at training.
If something goes wrong or wrong, he'll say it right away.
He knows his body and trusts his feelings.
That's what we have to do.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and what to do.
A new approach has also been found in Šadeiko.
"I am not the one who makes maximum exercise," he says and says that the most important thing is getting the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
The baby fun of the loved ones
Happy emotions have also been offered the happiness of loved ones in Šadeiko.
Both her ex - training partner, Maris Mägi, and Sister Grete, recently received parental support from new weather citizens.
"It's been interesting," says Šadeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking is equal to training the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that he believes that wine can train his brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
It is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but about the "very active" process of taste of wine.
When we smell the glass, we turn the wine in the mouth, we put our brain to work by enjoying it and perceptively.
According to Sheperdi, wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but taste arises from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He's a comparison of how the brain sees the colors.
"The taste is not in wine, the taste creates a wine taste," says Sheperd.
Things that still affect the appearance of wine taste are, for example, the age, sex, and even the amount of spit that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, says that wine is not to be drunk.
"There must be more in action," he says.
If you take too big a sip, the system will be overcrowded.
Too much wine drink can damage the brain instead of profit - according to the 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, balance loss and reduced mental ability are at risk.
10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less wages from colleagues
The data from the personnel searching company Fontes reveal that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less wages from colleagues.
Ten percent pay gap between men and women, writes on the portal of Genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the wages study of the ICT sector.
Overall, there were fewer than 8 577 posts.
63% of posts were employed by men.
"Although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and that the remaining companies do not have a pay gap, in reality similar work is on average 10% higher than the men's monthly basic salary and 8% higher than the average annual salary for women's own", said Fontese analyst Ilmar Northerna.
"Narcose" 3rd season advertising clip: now that Pablo Escobar has gone, Cali will take over the Netflix hit series.
Despite being exposed to Pablo Escobar's killer in the second season of "Narcose", the series of Netflix has not ended far.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service and the first of them have already been made up with a promotional climax that upsets the series of new evils.
In the third season, the DEA will pay its attention to the world’s richest drug industry - Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful Crusades "like Fortum 500 companies", simply with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilbertto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) in this brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) conducts links with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
The recently released ad ticket sees Pedro Pascal returning to Javier Penana as a character recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement aid against drugs.
Among other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Wheelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will be opened on September 1.
According to the United Nations, Afghan democracy depends on women's role in politics
On Wednesday, the head of the UN Afghanistan mission said that elections can represent the people only if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN relief mission, said that hundreds of women are candidates for local Soviet elections, three women are candidates for the Vice-President, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The importance of women's role cannot be over-expressed," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Selections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The election and presidential elections of the Afghan local councils take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has threatened, for its part, the electoral process, which coincides with the transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes acceptable.
The elections of this year will be marked for the first time by the peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that women's strong role in democracy will be enhanced by the success of Afghanistan.
According to Afghanistan's independent electoral committee, 1.2 million registered voters have been registered.
The joy of sharing makes every thing brighter in both big and small.
There is always too little time in common, but the exercise with the moors provides a good opportunity to combine the association, the game, the proximity and the burden.
And what a convenient solution - anywhere you cruised in the summer, living hankys are always with you and reminds you of their little voiceless memory: "Let's practice too!"
Start with heating - it's very good to have a regular ball game or go along the beach bar.
The cap is the base for keeping feet and bourbon - who would want to take the shape of the sand cake from the waves during the summer?
It's amazing to use children instead of the cloth!
First of all, it is safe and comfortable, the difficulty grows steadily at the same rate as the training force.
Progressive ones can also be set up with pretty big children.
A child trains balance, reads repetitions, and feels the pleasure of being high - schooled and important.
At the same time, larger children can heat themselves.
The range of movement will be fixed by touching the earth and stretching up the hands.
Hold your fingers straight, ask the mini-container to hold tight.
A child can read reinventments and feel like a coach.
The plan is useless, but a hopelessly boring exercise for the child.
But it's easy to make things more fun!
Game-plank: Take a long planner, one of which you can go through.
In fact, it's harder than usual, but it's much more fun to do than in the meantime to give a friend a hand.
To add the load, you can stay in the plank, on the back of the foot, and walk around in this position.
A small child may be put on hips for extra trouble, but this exercise offers fun for all children.
At the same time, the crabs get the burden of triflage, ash and belly like an infection.
The child descends on his feet so that his body weight is distributed equally in front and back.
You can hold your hands for safety.
Put your feet up and stretch straight up.
You can fly, have fun, balance training and difficulty.
A little coach's life is an extraordinarily fun when he gets a little kiss on every coming up.
Additional loads are given to stretching the legs.
Make sure the back is in a neutral position.
Children themselves have much more fun doing stomach muscles in pairs and platings.
Handicraft and pulse cap.
Track child safety, knee position, and keep your back neutral.
All children's favorite and great fun!
At the same time, it's truly effective throughout the body.
The sports equipment was Ott (10), the Dark (8), the Lucky (4).
From the Philippines to the heart of a wide world, or of the Ollgkoti Moophans
The bag of straws is a summer class, which has become a piece of faith in recent years, which, on one of the right souvenirs, has to hang at his hands and which has been used by traders, regardless of its modest origin, to rub a price label in line with the hit.
A bag of straws, apparently, is one of the things that each one has once existed in life, and has not caused any special emotion.
It just exists, and if it isn't, there's nothing broken.
Now, however, the straws are making a real race and fashion fans have changed their fine design bags for summer months, rather than for simple sacks of straw.
At the same time, it is not only a beach bag, but it is equally popular as a street bag, and even the bravest women walk into the office.
However, it is appropriate to clarify before the boss’s weekly schedule still sits or pays for the wet and laptop to be put in a slightly more formal fogadan.
However, divorce has made women’s true summer love from their shoulder bags.
For example, reading foreign fashion logos, the first thing remains that the fashion worlds, on a holiday trip, will be the first thing to do to the local market, and they will buy a straw bag, which will then be the whole holiday trip, and which is accompanied by the beach, the market, and also the girlfriends on the city's tails.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy bags from the market a larger pile and sell or sell them to their loyal readers.
In doing so, it is worth noting that the demand for the bags is so great among the readers that women (and men) in the real world might go hand-in-hand to each other to become the happy owner of a bag.
In some ways, such a madness is understandable, as few times in a fashion world, it is possible to buy just a few euros for some of the things that have risen into a hit-and-run situation.
True, planning traders have found a simple way to spend money here, and so are finer luxury brands for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Obviously, even so, more wealthy customers do not feel like simple mortals who promote with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy a debt of over a thousand euros in Dolce & Gabbana.
However, the interpretation of Chanel's shoulder bag can take place in a circle of €6000.
Unlike the majority of fashionrs, the straws are not derived from any of the great fashions, but their story began much further.
It is said that straws are from far away from the Philippines, where they have been carried wide.
The weighting of the shoulder bag is particularly high there, and locals are not often seen walking around with them.
It's supposed to come from the 14th century C.E.
However, since the shoulder bag does not have to braid as hard as the basket, it is possible to collect patterns and other materials that will make the bag more personal and more attractive.
For example, recently there are particularly trendy bags, with colored shirts or strips in it.
However, the letter of appreciation may be sent to actress Jane Birkin, one of whom had not been seen before.
It was exactly what he had to do with all kinds of clothing kits, and it didn't even have to go to Cannes's film festival.
However, with the popularity of the bags today there is no less role to play than the fact that caring for them is a head of cock and, unlike all other Sumadans, they do not have to be cared for by special means, but also by water and wet towels.
As in the case of trendy attacks, after the classic appearance, brands have come out with all kinds of interpretations.
For example, if you would like to buy yourself a ridge or a tiny shoulderbread, you might want to buy it.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag never goes from the fashion, but on the shoulder.
But what about the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, a bag of straws that resembles its style is open and short, as well as straws, has been considered to be classic.

A missing man was found on the island three days ago
The treasure left her home on Wednesday night in the beginning of Kärla unknownly.

GMB worries about the investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The company is waiting for a confirmation from McVitie's managers of long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow factory.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has kept silent on the future investment in the Tollcross object.
More than 500 people work in plants producing Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products.
McVitie's owner, Platis, said they've invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years.
That's where employees were hired and union presidents were "the first to hear" if anything about the factory changes.
In a letter sent to the company's head of business, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's company "to resolve concerns about the fact that funding is not used to modernise production lines".
GMB's Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we can't find out from the head of the object that Tollcross's business needs and the investment plan for the future makes our members deeply concerned.
Many generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely composed of local communities and people around Glasgow, with a strong pillar of support to ensure decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social waste.
Therefore, in view of the jobs, wages and well-being of the eastern Glasgow East, and in the context of Brexit, the rise in living costs and the chronic decline in production, we urgently need a strong-growing company in McVitie."
The representative of the platform said: "The head of the Customs Cross just received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company corresponds directly to it, as we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting was held between the employees of Tollcross and GMB representatives, where a wide range of problems were discussed.
So we discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are looking at our activities in progress - and this applies to all our companies and objects - in order to ensure their competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested over 5 million pounds of Tollcross's object, most of it has gone into production lines and operations to improve operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a production object and if any change in its activities is to occur, the employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear from it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about the approach to Neymar?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain won't give up trying to lure Neymar into his ranks by offering $189 million to buy it. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record of conquest?
This hurried approach has opened the summer transition window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to crush more than double the current world records of oversolding, which were built during the previous season by Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for $89 million.
Once the transition has been completed, Neymarist will become the most expensive player in the world and also the most well-paid professional athlete in the world, who will start to earn over 500 000 pounds a week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona is known to be angry because of both the approach and the Neymar break-out, although the source close to the Catalans board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of its football player since his arrival from Santo in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world about this opportunity three years ago?
In 2014, when Manchester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the contract with Blaise Matuid, Nasser strongly warned all clubs thinking about recruiting some of the best PSG players.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they touch any of our players, we're going to meet them and contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect every club.
But if they try to make a deal with one of our players, they must face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have gone beyond this limit, as the Spanish club previously showed interest in the PSG's mid-field player Marco Verratt this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave on any condition and that Barcelona could have a setback as a result of this interest, losing one of its precious assets in Neymar’s form.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brex is seriously threatened by a struggle between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned Northern Ireland on his first visit after his appointment in June.
"I can't imagine who'd benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made available the free movement of current people and goods, said Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: build bridge, not borders," he stressed.
According to the Vardkar, he would prefer to remain part of the European Union, and because it is not capable of being, he would be part of the European common market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make the departure of Britain more smoother would be to establish the European Union and the UK Customs Union, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could have such an agreement with Great Britain without a doubt".
An alternative to this would be to return to customs points, which would declare historical fragmentation and political failure.
"To trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "a challenge of our generation" and warned that this result could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily life.
The Irish Prime Minister met Belfast, visiting with the leaders of the main political parties in Northern Ireland.
My first half-long triathlon passed through Märt Avand: Ironman can pass through everyone.

Although Avandi lost both to Raio Rajaoja (time 04:59:53) and to Jürgen Lig (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called "prominent class" competitions.
Last year, Tanel Padar lost Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
The German John Molda was crowned with 3:58:27 by the men of the Ironman series, the best Ivo Great time was 04:14:09.
