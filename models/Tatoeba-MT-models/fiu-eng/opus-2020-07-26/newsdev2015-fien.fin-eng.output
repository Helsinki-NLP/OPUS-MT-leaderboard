Change in company support practices - Country - Regions - News - Karjalainen
In addition to EU company aid, the management of national company aids will also be concentrated in four ely centres from mid September.
In Eastern Finland, the South Savo ely centre is located in Mikkel.
According to the new company aid law, which entered into force at the beginning of July, EU Structural Funds must no longer be allocated to large enterprises unless it is a whole new operation.
The subsidiaries of municipalities of more than five thousand inhabitants are also considered to be large municipalities.
On the other hand, investment in local economic conditions can continue to be supported by EU support.
In Eastern Finland, the strength of the EU and national support management unit will become around 30 people.
For the time being, they all continue to work in their current locations.
For example, Kalevi Pölösen, Head of the Structural Funds Unit of the South Savo Ely Centre, has a job in Joensuu.
Researcher: In this country Russia is now working towards Ukraine
Russia is consistent, even if it does not always seem to be.
Head of the Department of National Defence College Strategy, Lieutenant Colonel, Docent Torsti Siren was not surprised by the conflicting Ukrainian news of the Monday morning morning.
This has been the same thing for a long time, Siren says.
Other Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (read more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine reports that its troops are currently fighting with the Russian tank department near Luhansk Airport, and that the tank department has received confirmations (read more here).
Mr Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire in Minsk's negotiations.
Russia denies its involvement and immediately needs to obtain the outcome of the negotiations in order to get their permanent status in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That's the whole thing, siren says.
This is the big pattern: suddenly, we need to negotiate and precisely so that Russia can take its own hold in the areas of Luhanski and Donetsk.
Finnair externalizes cabin services for Norwegian companies, vacations people
Finnair begins buying cabin services under acquisition from the Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation.
The agreement concerns the routes of Finnair Hong Kong and Singapore at the first stage, but is intended to be extended later.
In Finland, the appearance of the two routes leads to a reduction of about one hundred staffing years, which will be carried out at the first stage on holiday, the company reported in its information.
In addition, the work of some 80 Asian temporary agency workers will be terminated at the time the routes are externalised.
Finnair already told me in June that it intends to externalise about 20 routes of cabin services over the next two years.
The exits were concluded when no savings were made with staff.
It's supposed to start next year's January-March.
According to the company, the negotiations on cooperation will continue with other partner candidates.
According to the study, sleep problems are multiplicating the risk of nervous back pain, i.e., ischemic pain, for those who work hard.
Firefighters were monitored for 13 years in the field of occupational health.
The link between sleep disorders is surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and sustainability of firemen tested regularly does not appear to protect against pain, says the director of the study, Mr. Sirpa Lusa's Office of Health at Work.
The work of firemen is an irregular shift, where shifts can be stretched up to 24 hours.
According to the occupational health institution, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on the survey conducted in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you know any new causes of water damage?
It is easy to destroy other apartments
Water damage The water damage is not always caused by a leaking tube or handle, a reminder of the host union’s expert.
We have had contact with aquarium since the crackdown has caused water damage in the house company, that it is possible to ban aquariums, says Marina Furuhjelm, legal expert in the host union.
Furyjäm reminds us that only pipes and sewers are not the common causes of water damage, but also today, more and more new machinery such as ice-creaming machines have caused floods of housing.
Many do not realize that machines such as washing or washing washing machines should not be left unattended.
The water supply must also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on top, as otherwise pressure in the pipe may lead to water leakage.
A resident may be considered negligent in the event of failure to fulfil these obligations, in which case the resident is liable for damages.
Of course, in these cases, home insurance can compensate for damage, depending on the terms and circumstances of the insurance.
If it can be demonstrated that the resident has caused negligence damage, the resident has liability.
If the resident has entered the shower on the floor well, neglect can often be proven because in these cases the water is flooded elsewhere and the serviceman comes into the apartment, which is found to be a dead person.
Furyjelm tells us that due to the generalisation of entry on the floor wells, two floor wells have now been installed in several student dwellings.
Water damage has also caused water pollution, although no longer to the extent that they were more popular.
Even the dog’s water cup and the fall of the domestic wine container can become real water damage.
I also know a case where there were many cats in the apartment who had peed on the floor so that there was extensive damage, Furuhjelm tells.
The principles of liability for repair always apply in the same way if the company does not provide otherwise in the company’s company order.
The shareholder is responsible for repairing the surface material and for damage to the building structure as well as damage to other dwellings.
Water damage easily destroys other homes because the structure of concrete really absorbs water.
According to the Furyjeltim, the battery leaks of housing are particularly difficult because batteries are easily leaking into secret structures.
Water damage can be caused by today’s increased air temperature pumps that produce condensation water.
Water should lead to a fixed sewer or rainwater network, not just a container.
It is also the responsibility of the shareholder to remove water, snow, ice and garbage from the balcony, and to advise legal experts.
Furyjäm provides that even if the rules of the house company do not require, for example, a solid removal of the washing machine, the insurance may contain a condition for which compensation is not granted for that reason.
You should be careful with your own home insurance policy.
However, I consider washing machines to be a major risk, for example, of water removals in the tub, which have caused many damage.
I recommend that the removal doors should always be led firmly to the draining stand.
Remove snow and water with balcony
Control of washing machine, washing machine, etc. machines while on.
Sealing of water mines (washing washing machine and dishwasher)
Cleaning of the ceiling well is partly visible twice a year and a half.
The recommendation is to link the removals to the sewer firmly.
Check the gloves and their possible leaks
Regular freezer melting
Do you have any experience with water damage?
Tell me about your experiences in comment.
FC Honka lost again and poured into a serial jumbo.
At Tapiola Sports Park on Sunday night, two of the weakest teams of the football Veikkalusliiga gymnastics met.
In June last, FC Honka, who celebrated the victory, will host seven games in a winning tube, sailed from the Phalo Society of Vasa.
VPS just accepted Honka's previous victory in July.
Sunday’s encounter with the sub-group came to a good pole, as the VPS returned from a long time to a profit rate of 2-1.
Chief coach Olli Huttunen complained before the game about the inefficiency of his team, but the mixed Honka defense facilitated VPS's goal-making problems.
It's probably very nervous to perform.
We didn't get any longer attacks, we couldn't keep the ball," Huttunen estimates his own performance.
In the first half of the time, Honga's top of the league Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played very uncertainly.
Both of the pink paints were born as a result of the loose play of the captors.
My opening goal was only seen after five minutes of the game when Steven Morrissey directed Sebastian Strandvall's launch by an abandoned Honka painter, Walter Viitalan.
It's a shame for the first half of a time.
By the field, the team did the opposite of what was agreed before the game," Shefki Kuqi, head coach of Honga.
After the start-up, the tops got their game full and rolled the ball at the top of the attack.
Especially the midfield player, Carlos Portela, and Roni Porokara, who worked hard to find places of action, but the last solutions were almost repeatedly dim.
The closest goal was Honga's midfield man Jussi Vasara, however, whose 20-metre shot was slightly past the VPS painting.
VPS was effective in attacking its flawless attackers and Honga's mixed toppitrilar.
At half an hour, the whales made a 2-0 match when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart got through two lines.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was on the right side of the game during the opening period and repeatedly created situations on the left side.
Steward's speed again seemed to be too much for the upper hand defense all the time.
"In half time, if you lose, you lose with honor," Kuqi told me.
In the second episode, the enchanted Honka applied fiercely for the mining ground.
The team was twice close to the hit until the third attempt succeeded.
The cooker, Yerai Vilaboa, finished the goal from the center of the penalty zone.
After the Vilabo goal, Honga had half an hour to set the match.
The Espoo team took more and more risks, giving VPS the opportunity to take dangerous counterattacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey got into their game once with Five others, but the hordes of the Honka painting kept the home team in play.
After the end, Honka was a little tired, and it didn't get any more goals over time.
With the kill, Honka poured the Veikkausliiga last time there are seven more matches left.
Press: Putin threatened to conquer Kiev in two weeks
Russian President Vladimir Putin was quite loud in his telephone conversation with the President of the EU Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, reports the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
The Putin expressed its enthusiasm for the European Union's plans to tighten up sanctions against Russia.
If I want to, I can take Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica tells me Putin has said something.
According to the press, Putin's message to Barroso was this: it is not worth getting annoyance of Russia with new sanctions.
Putin gave Russian TV the first channel an interview about Ukraine's crisis on Sunday night.
In the interview Putin explained that he held a conflict entirely within Ukraine and called on the Kiev Government to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiev very much about the fire of civilians in eastern Ukraine.
Russia "can't watch by the side" if people are shot to death in the vicinity, Putin said.
Esco Roine confesses: The actor's work destroyed the family
hard work The Konkari actor and the theatre company grew to recognize how the actor’s profession destroyed his first marriage.
The actor Esko Roine will fill in for 70 years next Friday, but I think he's a qualified saying that age is just a number.
I don't see any difference compared to the year before or two years ago or ten years ago.
The spiritual puberty seems to continue, says Esko Roine.
He's been retired for years, but still he's been working hard for a lot of men.
Sometimes it was a joke that there were not many plays in this country without Esko Roinet.
Currently, Raine has a role in the Helsinki City Theatre's play How to succeed in business life, at the Tampere Labour Theatre's Előlőtő and at the Tampere Komedia Theatre Kvartet.
Roine will also be seen in the future Risto Räppuja film.
KUVA: Reijo Hietanen
Her acting career didn't start promising.
I didn't go to school with a tiger picture.
40-50 years later, the teacher said it was because I was so bad.
Esko Roine didn't fall.
The career selection was clear. There was no choice.
It seemed close and loving.
I was so busy in the field that I left school and went to the army as a volunteer just to get to the theater school as quickly as possible.
Roine has made about 200 theater roles and 300 TV shows slightly depending on how it is calculated.
If the work is calculated as angels, that every part of the TV series is its own show, then the TV stuff is over 600.
I was three years old in a new day, which was done three episodes a week.
In the other spring, I was killed when I didn't have time to do it.
Commitments for autumn 2016
Esko's isosikot Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full attack and are still doing the charming roles in the Tampere Work Force Theatre.
My little brother's going to hang out with me for years.
That's what it looks like, but you don't know about this age.
You always have to take a little reservation that I'll come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
Calendar has reservations for autumn 2016.
They've left a man behind for years.
Age is not coming alone.
The knees have been operated, the hip is inflamed, and the joint is in trouble, but when you don't let it be too disturbed, it's in these heads, Esko Roine says.
To the Tv General, Roine became known, for example.
From the pirate radio, and from a visit to Antti Einio, where she and Antti shared hundreds of banknotes.
It was Antti Einio, who divided the crops.
I tried to make them sad and not rainy.
In the Reinikainen series, Roine was a superstitious Inspector Rautakallio.
He became the favorite of the Tampere policemen, at the institution when it happened to be the same-looking Inspector.
A cop stopped the car on the street, pulled the window open and yelled at me, "that Raltakallio is great!"
Working Group Success
The theatres of Roe and her mind have remained, for example.
Producer and Master Class of the City Theatre in Helsinki, the death of the Trader of the Tampere Workers' Theatre and the long-term journey of the Tampere Theatre to the Night.
All of this is that the performances have been popular.
It's not my fault, it's my team's success.
There's been criminalism.
The role of Pekka Puupää in the movie is one of those.
There are others.
It's because I've agreed to it too easy.
I don't know if I'm gonna regret those roles, but the outcome is not satisfactory for me or the viewers.
As an actor, you can't choose your own jobs.
It's just been done nicely, what's been told.
Besides theatre work, Roine has tried to succeed in business.
In the '80s, he held a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot in Tampere.
It was a educational experience.
It became nothing when I tried to be the CEO of the Tampere Theatre, the actor and then the food business operator at the same time.
If I remember correctly, within a year, it became clear that these must not be agreed at all.
It was typical that when the show was in the end or in the middle of the hour and I had time to think about whether I'm gonna put the sauna on, the restaurant became a call that your friends are here hoping to see you after the show.
Recalls for Birthday
On his day of birth, Esko Roine has been shown memories, as ghost writers Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
Some sort of nail they've made from the facial images of the masking device.
I used to play in Zoom when they called me a female explorer.
They didn't even know me, they didn't know me.
The book has been written for years.
In time, Roine told me that no news bomb has been promised because she hasn't done anything so bad, or if she is, she won't tell me.
I made a small preliminary statement.
I say that if someone expects scandalous revelations or good gossip, you should stop reading this.
There's a lot of business involved there, and as an actor as the director of the theatre.
The publisher feels that there is also a tour of an unscrupulous theater school.
It was a pretty normal student life, but as a kid, all kinds of tricks were made.
It wasn't as wild as Turka's time.
It was very different.
I don't know how much I got from there but confidence that when the school has gone so far, it won't be closed if the actions aren't better.
I didn't have to think how good I would be if I went to school.
Roine also recalls the legends of the National Theatre.
I became friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Hurlyinen and got to work with them.
There were legends from my first father-in-law Kaarlo Death.
Pia Hattara and I had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I had time to get to know him at school.
The middle son of the fire, Martti, was with me on the same course.
At the Theatre School, Roine met her first wife, Marjukka Halttusen.
As a pain, he remembers his divorce.
After a relatively long battle, the children were divided.
Not in two parts, but in a way that my daughter went to my mother and son to me.
I did not think it was a good solution, and I believe that children are in a pretty good way now agree with me as adults.
It's not uncommon in theatre circles that silver is divided.
In my case, some part was that I did a lot of work back then.
I was in the theater almost every case.
Then there was television and radio on it.
I did a long day and a family life suffered.
On the day of the party, maybe a night off.
Esko Roine celebrates Tampere's Labour Theatre at the Mental Nurse on 7 September.
The festival will continue at the Helsinki City Theatre on 21 and 28 September.
It's a mind-responsor who's in there, too.
I was working for the 50s, and I was working for the 60s.
When such an easy moving play happened, I thought we'd keep the sevens, too, and we'd get them out with one rhythm.
Roe and I don't have any holiday expenses as a real birthday.
I remember it's free night, but I'm not going to swear.
I may have been snorting some job for that day.
Or maybe it's a strange night off, which I'm going to keep on the night off, Roine says.
Aviation companies are concerned about the production chain
Some of the smaller British aircraft manufacturers are concerned that the manufacturing capacity problems in the supply chain may result in the ambitious plans of large aircraft manufacturers to increase the production of passenger aircraft.
In Britain, thousands of companies in the chain of aircraft production currently enjoy an unexpected large number of aircraft and engine development plans at the same time.
Aviation and defence
While some are enjoying order intake, warnings have been provided about the capacity problems at the production chain and price pressure.
"It is quite true that there is a price pressure, especially now that the volume of production poses challenges," says Craig Gallagher, Director-General of MB Aerospace, such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, the CEO of North West Aerospace Alliance, representing about 240 carriers of North England's aircraft production, we need more capacity.
"Are strategies and investment plans based on these growth plans?
To tell you the truth, I'm not quite sure.
Above all, we need more investment in new production equipment and machinery needed to achieve these production volumes," Gallagher says.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in aircraft building are part of the problem.
According to the CEO of JJ Chhurchill, producing gas turbine wings, Andrew Churchill, the company is behind it with a "sufficient time" when several new construction plans began to be implemented at the beginning of the year.
In the blink of our eyes, we moved from very low production to a state where production capacity was exceeded.
Many orders were only paid afterwards, and we also had to try to tighten forward.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of the new production plans," Churchill says.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by placing 800 000 pounds on new machines and hiring 26 new employees.
Several industry players believe that investment and coordination between small suppliers is needed further if Britain wishes to maintain its position as the second largest operator in the aviation sector after the US.
The President of Ford Aerospace and Tynesid's engineer for fine mechanics, Geoff Ford, says that the order ratio should increase producers' confidence and want to expand and increase production capacity, as work needs to be sufficient.
"If this does not happen, we will lose in competition against other countries," Ford says.
A few large players are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
The company that produced aeroplanes and enginenoss from the FTSE 250 index, Senior, bought the parts of the aircraft in Malaysia, by UPECA’s 75 million pounds.
Last year MB Aerospace bought companies from North America and Poland.
“It is possible to buy start-up companies that create new activities, but in fact, the limited nature of design and the number of engineers slowing down production,” says Gallagher MB Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned price pressure from large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engines.
Some people believe that the problems of operators in the production chain are being exaggerated.
Marcus Bryson, head of GKN’s aviation division, also active in the UK aviation trade trade, believes that the production chain has dealt with the problem better than in previous years.
There's pressure in the supply chain, but I wouldn't describe the situation as critical.
"The introduction of new technologies and advanced processes is more important," Bryson says.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned the wrongs and are now more careful so as not to increase the number of buildings too quickly.
As Boeing tried to increase its production in 1997, it was faced with major difficulties when the company made losses and factories and the production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, Director of Rolls Royce's Engineering Unit, says that the company has not yet encountered problems in the production chain, which delivers most of the 18 000 parts required for the manufacture of the jet engine.
"You will certainly be drowsy, but we believe that we have done a more thorough job on the supply chain by choosing the best partners and keeping in touch with suppliers when they are preparing to increase their activity," Wood says.
According to the CEO of Boeing, James McNerney, the company's production chain has had time to prepare for an increase in delivery volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have been open to journalists, which is very important.
Fabrice Brégier, CEO of the Airbus passenger transport unit, says that the company will do everything in its power to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase the production of the A350 model to 10 aircraft per month by 2018.
"We may not succeed in any of the suppliers, and it is our job to try to prevent this situation as well as to support suppliers and look for alternatives, but it is waiting for major problems," Brégier says.
Bergier says that Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: "The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the editor.
So this is mine and Airbus's work.
Hong Kong's demonstration teams are starting the "Cansal of Credentialism" in the Beijing language of open elections
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
Activists supporting democracy will spread to the streets of Hong Kong after China rejected their open elections requirements.
The groups in support of democracy in Hong Kong stress that demonstrations can be stamped and swear to ensure that the "time of civil integrity" in the city begins to oppose the elections proposed by the Chinese Government.
Thousands of protestors threatened the rain from Hong Kong’s hot horizon as a result of their marching to the Occupy Central Group, which is in favour of democracy, in front of the Council’s premises responsible for the implementation of the laws on Sunday night, where the protestors invited people to participate in a large sit-down demonstration to undermine the city’s financial quarter.
The demonstration took place only hours after Beijing announced that it would prohibit voters' right to propose candidates in public in 2017 in the municipal elections, undermining these months of protests, which would further increase the city's tenure.
The demonstrations of the Occupy Central Movement will take place in front of the key government buildings in Hong Kong.
"We want a fair and decent election," says Dion Tse, a 24-year-old publisher of the website, who attended the Sunday demonstration with his 50-year-old mother Wong Chi-y.
The government doesn't respect the sound of Hong Kongers.
We want the government to listen to us and see the determination of Hong Kong.
China's highest law-making body, the Chinese People's Congress, approved plans for electoral changes, which allow only two of the three candidates to participate in the first direct elections in Hong Kong.
However, the proposal requires the approval of the 1200-vileged designation committee, and opposition politicians believe that this will effectively prevent the access of the different political views to the electoral flags.
The speakers will participate in the demonstration of the Occupy Central Love and Peace Protestant, which was carried out in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong government building.
According to police estimates, more than 2 600 people were currently involved in the demonstration.
A large number of policemen followed when some 100 protestors led by the Scholarism student group gathered to Grand Hyatt late on Sunday, where Li Fein, a member of the Communist Party, was supposed to stay at Beijing after he arrived.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of the Occupy Central, attended a press conference with members of the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism and Federation of Students.
However, in order to comply with the law, he said the exact date when the blockade of roads would take place, but he called on the participants to closely monitor the development of the situation in the "in the next few weeks" while adding that the city is officially moving to the "time of national integrity".
Benny Tai will answer the press questions.
"Look at the man next to you," he said, in the Sunday demonstration, that two characters representing disobedience in China were in front of the advertising board.
That man will take over the center with you!
Joshua Wong said earlier that preparations for the demonstrations of high school students are under way and are designed to be held at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to show their mind by refusing to teach.
"In addition to academic responsibility, we have social responsibility," Wong says.
In Beijing, Deputy Secretary-General Li Fei, the Committee of the People's Congress, told journalists that the defence of the 'non-national requirements' of the universal right of vote is 'time-consuming' and from some Hong Kong politicians who are trying to "mand society and mislead it".
"Unusual proposals such as the appointment of a public candidate have wasted a great deal of time", Li says, demanding that the electoral method should be created in such a way as to fit the real situation of each society and the legal framework.
The general initiative on voting rights can only be accepted if a large majority, i.e. two thirds of Hong Kong's 70-person legislative body, is in favour of this initiative, which means that 27 opposition members of the government can stop the initiative.
Li warned that Hong Kong might be drawn to a prolonged political debate if the reform proposal was rejected by veto.
"That would harm business and city development," he says.
Almost 800 000 people voted in an informal questionnaire organised by Occupy Central in June to oppose China's demands.
Even 172 000 people marched for democracy on 1 July at the same time as the March of 17 August against Beijing and against the Occupy Central movement attracted some 88 000 participants, while the books are from Hong Kong University, although the estimates of the police and organisers differ considerably from these figures.
Three injured lightning attacks on the New York bathing area
In a lightning strike on a beach in New York City, three people were injured.
According to the fire department, men were injured on the Orchard Beach coast in Pelham Bay on Sunday night when the storms went over the area.
The injured men are in hospital.
The extent of the injuries is unknown.
The lightning struck when the rough thunderstorms wiped over the city.
The storm rains, thunderstorms and lightnings cut off the Labor Day weekend party and the U.S. Open tennis match in Queens and forced the music festival to close early on East River Island.
Ten commercial flights to city airports were late due to bad weather.
The new idea is not to please
This is the latest guide for network users to employees and supervisors, and it is shared by Harvey Schachter, author of the Monday Morning Manager website.
According to Detective Seth Godin, a good idea is to recognize comments like "I don't like it" or "I don't understand".
Unless so, the idea is probably popular and self-evident — i.e. boring and everyday — or the advantages it brings with it are so little that they should not be pursued.
As a historian in history, Harvard Drew Gilpin never repeated anything that had already been published so that people would not think that he had nothing new to offer.
Now, as the headmaster of the university, he repeats the same thing several times so that the message can be widely received.
Advertising consultant Bob Hoffman thinks TV and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more people read the news about the network does not mean that the internet would be good between advertising – just as the first phone was a popular communication tool but a bad alternative for advertisers.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson says that one word is enough to motivate workers: together.
One of the participants in the study was told that they decided to cooperate with the problem, even though they actually worked alone in an empty room, and these participants worked longer and solved more problems than the participants who were not told about the cooperation at the beginning.
If the task is to find a repeat pattern or relationship between the two units, Dave Paradi advises to forget about Microsoft SmartArt and instead use the Diagrammer.com program, where you can choose between 14 different relationships.
Mount Stuart’s excavator surgery due to safety risk
The specialist has been temporarily removed from his post, and the national health system in the United Kingdom ceased to direct patients to the hive surgery in that private hospital after the hospital’s problems were raised.
Two people went to Torbay Hospital after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay Hospital in Devon has said that he was in contact with 19 patients on 26 July and called them "a radical clinical trial".
The Mount Stuart hospital regretted the matter and said that it had been started to look into the matter after the doctor resigned.
The case became known at the Torbay Hospital when two patients in Mount Stuart applied for it for first aid due to eye disorders.
According to Torbay Hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients who were all studied on the same day were required for repairs.
The Torbay Hospital and the South Devon and Torbay Hospital have not been directed by patients after the problems with Mount Stuart.
David Sinclair said that "We have identified the problem at its early stage and were able to contact all the patients concerned quickly", the interim director of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation, led by Torbay Hospital.
Whenever we direct patients to the service provider, we carry out quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider fulfils the latest legal requirements and that its permit issues are in order.
According to Gill Gant, the patient safety manager of the South Devon and Torbay hospital care district, "the safety of patients is always absolutely one, so it is important that these hives are not carried out for as long as we can be fully sure that the treatment is safe".
Ramsay Health Care UK, which manages Mount Stuart Hospital, asked "unfortunately for any patient who suffered complications".
The company was reported to be "as soon as we learned about the possible problem, we and later the Torbay Hospital were called to all patients involved".
This specialist has had a treatment permit for Ramsay Health Care since 2005 and has been registered as a doctor since 1989.
To date, he has performed 4 537 scallops in different parts of the organisation. According to statistics, the clinical results of the surgery he has had were excellent, and the percentage of complications is less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor was temporarily removed from office until the case had been studied.
What's "4chan"?
A refugee anonymous communication site was the first to publish leaked naked images
What exactly is "4chan", and why was it the hacker's first option when he published stolen photos?
"4chan" was set up in 2003. It has raised a communication website, which is called as much as it is called.
The site is divided into a number of sections, i.e. notice tables where anonymous users can discuss everything possible, video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other online forums, users do not create the same, constantly used profile and their publications are not maintained.
With the most popular notice tables, comments may disappear in less than one minute when the latest publications set aside them in the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchist and surprising creative atmosphere for "4chan".
Anonymised members of the Community have created some of the most well-known mechanisms in the network (such as "rickrolling" and "lolcats"), but the lack of rules on the site has also led to the fact that the site has a lot of questionable or criminal content.
The most popular communication table on this site is /b/, which is intended for mixed discussions and is regularly published on NSFW content (Not Safe For Work).
This may include summer porn, but also rough and shocking pictures. An anonymous hacker published famous stolen images specifically on this noticeboard weekend.
American CytRx invests in cancer medicine research and development
CytRx is designed to improve cancer – or at least slow it down.
A company that produces biological drugs in Los Angeles, which, a short time ago became the subject of a coma caused by the sale of shares, has been specialised in the research and development of cancer medicines.
The most promising medicine is aldosorubicin, which is a more advanced form of doxorubicin commonly used in chemotherapy.
CytRx performs clinical trials in the treatment of aldosorubics soft tissue sarcoma, AIDS-related Kapos sarcoma and renewable glioblastoma or brain tumours.
It's like a controlled missile that goes directly to the tumour and not to the other body, says Steven Kriegsma, CEO of CytRx, on aldosorubis.
Aldosorubisin contains so-called "joint technology" that works like a Troija horse.
It binds directly to the protein in the blood, which also collects into the tumours, which leads directly to cancer cells.
The compound only releases the medicine in an acid environment, i.e. cancer cells, but not in a healthy tissue.
This technology allows patients to be given cancer medicine at more than and at more than one dose.
"It's like a missile that goes directly into the tumor and not into the other body," says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on developing medicines, CytRx does not make a profit.
This year, the company sold shares and collected $86 million for operating and research.
CytRx is currently looking for 400 patients worldwide in the crucial phase 3 clinical trial of soft tissue toxicity alternative treatment.
Soft tissue sarcoma is a form of cancer that develops in soft tissue in the body, such as blood vessels, muscles and fatty tissue.
Alternative treatment is used for cancer treatment where the initial treatment does not result in results.
If the clinical investigation is successful, CytRx plans to apply for a drug authorisation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration already in 2016, says Kriegsman.
The medicinal product could then be adopted in 2017.
Analysts say that the data published by CytRx in December in the previous clinical study showed that aldosorubis is a promising treatment for soft tissue toxicity.
"For a long time, the question was "We have not seen any clinical information about how much it differs from the medicine itself," says H.C. Wainwright & Co.
The publication of results confirmed a number of opinions that this treatment is different.
However, Fein says that it is difficult to predict the results and timing of the current clinical trial because it differs significantly from the previous study, which produced good results.
"Some things have to go right," he says.
Fein compares the development of medicinal products to the mining industry.
"At first, a lot of money is invested in finding that one gold salt, and the investment will continue for so long that I find that gold salt," he says.
The money will be spent on research and development for as long as the drug is managed to commercialise.
Several shareholders have called for the CytRx company to court because they believe it gave a better picture of the success of the reality.
In the complaint, the company was accused of employing a DreamTeam Group company engaged in investment relationships, which claimed to have hired people to write positive comments about CytRx and another biotech company for Forbes, Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet on pages such as the Forbes, Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool, and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the complainants, the articles did not indicate that the companies paid fees to the writers.
As a result of the news, Seeking Alpha announced that he had deleted articles that were against practice.
A number of letters concerning companies were also deleted from other sites.
Kriegsman refused to comment.
The company has hired an outside lawyer to reply to the complaints.
"I don't have time and energy to focus on this," says Kriegsman.
According to him, the real challenge of CytRx is to find talented workers who tend to employ biotech centres such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"This is in many respects deserted from the perspective of the pharmaceutical industry," he says.
Analyst View
The price of CytRx’s shares rose to $8.08 on 10 January and then fell to less than $3 in April when the charges for the advertising of shares came to public.
According to the Analyst magazine, complaints and negative publicity have decreased the cost of shares below their actual value.
"It's unfortunate," Fein says, "but I'm not sure if there's any easy way to bypass this thing as long as the perception is valid."
In the name of the law - police cameraman was killed in the middle of the description
On Tuesday night, when he was shot in the middle of the shooting, the cameraman of the Lain series, which was presented in Finland, based on real events.
The cameraman shot the shooting of an alien police department and a fast food restaurant from armed robbery between a suspect when he was hit by bullets.
He died of injuries he quickly received.
According to the TMZ website, the police reported that, in the shooting incident, a person suspected of armed robbery died in addition to a cameraman.
Since 1989 the series has been presented in the United States in the name of the first programme of true-tv.
In Finland, the series has been presented on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The question of an outsider is to play a crucial role in the court proceedings that started today in the event of the death of Ulvila.
Anneli Aueria is accused of murdering her husband, Jukka S. Lahti in 2006.
For the second time, the court of Pasa will deal with the case, as the Supreme Court restored it with new evidence of the court.
The purpose of court is that the judgment will still be given this year's side.
Auer was released in 2011.
At that time, the court considered the possibility of an outsider to be sufficiently likely.
In his opening address, C.E. Kalle Kulmala told the prosecutor's view on the night of the murder and the facts that exclude the possibility of an outsider.
In our view, the crucial question is whether the house has become an outside agent who has killed Jukka Lahtin Anneli Auer in the way and in time.
It's about the credibility of Anneli Auer's report," Kulmala said.
According to the prosecutor, he began a family dispute during which Auer had announced that he would leave home and seek divorce.
At some point they moved to the kitchen where Lahti was holding onto Auer and tried to stop him from leaving.
One of them took a kitchen knife," Kulmala described the events of the night of death on Monday.
According to the prosecutor, a number of things prove that there was no outsider.
For example, there is no sound of an outsider.
The oldest child in Auer's house, the daughter, told me in the interview that she saw the unsub leaving the back room.
In 2011, the judgment of the Tribunal was partly based on the daughter’s report.
According to the prosecutor, the daughter's observation can't be true.
"Tyryr didn't see an outsider in his parents' bedroom, even though he visited there twice," Kulmala said.
The prosecution's new witness has just been involved in the possibility of an outsider.
Jukka S. Lahti's sister has been telling me about what happened since night of the murder at the hospital.
According to a woman, her daughter only told me at the hospital that she only saw Lahti's body when she was in the back room at the scene of her death.
Auer's defence intends to present to the court a list of investigation lines whose role the police are not sufficiently informed by the defence.
Three years ago, when the court of Pasaa released Auer's charge, the court held the Neighbour to find a strange man's dna as one of the five external factors.
The sample later proved to be a dna of a scientist working at the Central Crime Police Laboratory
That's when 700 people took a dna sample.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigators were excluded," Juha Manner said.
One of the new witnesses in the defence tells us about a potential outsider.
The Ulvilian woman told the police about a man who, according to a woman, had confessed to his actions.
The police questioned him this summer.
The prosecutor made a decision that a man of the Porilamist had nothing to do with a life crime.
A woman's attorney filed a request for investigation because the prosecutor suspects she lied in his report.
Another of the new Witnesses in the defence is a nurse who worked in the central hospital of the Satakunta during the night of death.
In December last, Auer was sentenced to a life sentence for murder in prison.
According to the judgment of the Court of Justice, the possibility of an outsider is fought against, among other things, Auer’s children’s reports, the noises of the outsider’s emergency service, and the time required by the course of the events.
The verdict came out of voice two to one.
The less-favoured judge wrote that there is a need to interpret evidence that is contrary to the criminal case as a benefit of the accused.
That is why the daughter’s report must be interpreted as meaning that, despite the contradictions of the report, this had found the outsider leaving the back room.
Two oldest children in Auer have been called court hearing.
For the first time, the daughter was personally consulted last year in the rainy court.
As soon as he was in court, he didn't remember the night of the murder.
The second oldest child of Auer named his mother as the killer in the video interview in 2011.
The boy told me he heard the night of the murder happening behind the closed door.
He also told me that Auer was planning to kill for six months.
The boy has no duty as a lawyer to say nothing in court.
The court proceedings will continue today in consultation with Anneli Auer.
If necessary, the hearing of Auer will continue tomorrow.
Anneli Auer is currently in prison for more than seven years for sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin's participation in the G20 meeting be allowed?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him a number of first-class greeners.
The Putin is due to attend the G20 Summit in Brisbane in November, and Australia is very much discussing whether or not it should be allowed to enter.
The Punkrock Activist Group, Pussy Riot, called on Australia to ban Putin's participation in a summit involving more than 4,000 representatives of the most powerful countries in the world.
"This person has nothing to do with the G20 meeting," Maria Alyokhina said to the public in Sydney's fully packed opera house in connection with the Festival of Dangerrous Ideas.
Kiev has warned that he is on the brink of a 'full war', and Putin calls parts of Ukraine "Novorossia", or "new Russia." So is it necessary for us to welcome him?
Tony Abbott has said "to make a decision".
Mike Callaghan, director of the Lowy Institute of Research, says that the Australians cannot decide who will attend the meeting, even though the meeting is held in the country.
"Austria may decide who it is to enter the country, but this is an international meeting," he says.
Just as in New York's hosting UN meetings or Washington's hosting International Monetary Fund meetings, "it is not the father's duty to deny someone to be invited," Callaghan says.
Last week, Tony Abbott said that he would "save a decision" after Russia's blatant actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important issue.
Since Putin is coming to a very important international meeting, Australia does not have the right to decide on its own.
"But there is an important issue in question, which I will weigh much, and I believe that the other countries will also do so in the next few weeks," he says.
People will attend an anti-war meeting in Mariupoli, Eastern Ukraine.
The event lasts for two days, with a wide range of representatives from the world's largest and fastest-developed economies, where around two-thirds of the world's people live and account for 85% of world GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include, for example, Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as some specifically invited guests from non-G20 countries, such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia was faced with a questionable task of balancing the various interests under great public pressure.
In his view, the prime minister's best way of handling this is to take advantage of the opportunity to put Russia into public talk about its recent activities.
"The Prime Minister should say that we are going to take this opportunity to seek a very open dialogue and that he will require President Putin to make an account of his actions."
If Putin comes to the meeting, it's his duty to provide an explanation of his actions," Callaghan says.
There is clearly an increase in geopolitical pressure.
I think the world is waiting for them to talk about these things.
Russian rebels are preparing weapons at Donetsk Airport for the attack on Ukrainian military base in eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether Puti will attend the meeting, and Callaghan says this may not be known until a few days in advance.
I'm sure this is the last thing in Putin's mind.
He hardly notes that "I have to change my attitude towards Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November".
President Bill Shorte is of the opinion that Putin's visit to Australia is "in particular reservations", but he understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the Prime and Foreign Ministers to discuss with other countries and G20 whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
This is an international conference, not an Australian conference, and I understand that.
After the tragic events following the Malaysian Airlines accident, as well as the lack of proper cooperation in terms of weather, responsibility and air accident, and now, as thousands of Russian soldiers flock to Ukraine, I think that most Australians are very prepared to welcome Putin to Australia.
The German business world criticises the 'securities' of Berlin
Some of Germany's top business leaders warn that Germany has become "untrustful" and "free", as government policy threatens the competitiveness achieved by the problem of the country.
The criticism of Angela Merkel's government will occur at the same time as Europe's largest economy shows signs of slowdown, which will give rise to concerns as to whether it is able to run economic growth in the euro area on the ground.
The criticism of business leaders is the result of the intense opposition of the German business sector to political decisions, including the introduction of minimum wage and the reduction of the retirement age of certain long-term employees for 63 years.
"I think the greatest threat right now is excessive confidence in Germany, which inevitably causes the sense of selfishness," says Kurt Bock, CEO of the world's largest chemical producer, based on sales figures.
EU economy
He believes: "In general, there is a feeling that we are doing well, we have money to use and unemployment at a relatively low level, so what is the problem?"
I think there's a great danger here.
The German government's policy shows that we are not focusing on growth and not on the favourable environment for businesses, but instead we are focusing much more on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain bodies.
According to Markus Kerber, CEO of the German industrial organisation BDI, "The German situation is now good.
In the next ten years, however, each developed economy must change. ...[Germany] The reform programme does not achieve as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce, DIHK, has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
Germany's unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced, even if it has already slowed down consumption again.
However, the decrease in GDP in the second quarter has highlighted the vulnerability of the export-efficient Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP fell by 0.2% over the three months preceding June compared to the previous year.
The decline in German performance threatens to make the ECB’s fight against low inflation even more difficult and may make quantitative recovery more likely.
Kerber would like to see the government 'dissemination from public consumption to public investment', for example by focusing on future consumption increases in infrastructure rather than pensions.
According to Kerber, the Merkel government will destroy the fruits of his social-democratic predecessor Gerhard Schröder at the beginning of the 21st century with strict politics.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, CEO of Stiftung Familienunternehmen, the Foundation for Family Enterprises, "The German situation remains good compared to other countries.
It has been a praise for businesses and not for government policy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The example of the neighboring country in France has shown that the use of money in social aid and the restriction of freedom of management is the wrong way of action.
The leading German investment bank described the situation more explicitly, saying that recent government decisions are a disaster.
Germany is threatening to lose everything it has done so much work on just to please the voters.
This is my main concern right now," says the banker.
According to Bock, the energy reform of the new government coalition did not succeed in solving the fundamental weaknesses of the policy that have caused industrial competitiveness.
With Ashton Kutcher's handicraft Music Festivals, barred security officers' access to the fan
An actor, Ashton Kutcher, attended the Stagecoach casino festival in Indio, California, where he is reported to have been inflamed with a strict security officer.
Ashton Kutcher is reported to be in a timed fight with a security guard at the cantrimic festival.
Kutcher's fan tried to approach him with a backstage Stagecoach casino festival in California, and then the situation got robbed by hand, says the TMZ website.
Kutcher was in VIPs when a young woman approached him to say hello and hand him out.
When the star of the male series went to say hello to the fan, an over-intelligent security guard went in and caused a mischief.
The actor and security guard got into a handicraft, and Kutcher's friends had to go in between to arrest Kuchcher, says TMZ.
After leaving his ex-wife, Demi Moore, Kutcher is dating Mila Kunis, who is the stars of the former 70s of Kutcher.
The nojakka happened shortly after Angus T. Jones was practically removed from a set of standard acting cards after he published a video in which he called the series "roast" and called the fans not to look at it.
Actor Ashton Kutcher participates in the Stagecoach Music Festival in California.
Angus T. Jones, "Jake," calls the show "shit" and urges people not to look.
The Baltic Sea bacteria killed a vacationer.
Six people have been infected by the bacteria from Caribbean which are located in a popular German tourist destination.
One of the sick is in a coma.
The Vibriovulnicus bacteria are seen in parts of the Baltic Sea and other parts of the world, but most of them are found in the Gulf of Mexico.
The bacteria are more effective than 20 degrees in breaking waters.
"Bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are correct," Dr Heiko Will told the Local magazine of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's Health and Safety Agency (LAGuS).
The bacteria are found equally in Denmark, Poland and along the German coast.
According to LAGuS, the affected had been on vacation on the island of Usedom at the end of July.
He died early in August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks, and it is possible that his foot should be shot.
He went swimming near Ahrensopia with a small wound in his leg.
She went to the hospital after she found her foot turned blue on her way home.
Doctors noted that Vibriovulnicus was caused by blood poisoning in the leg.
"My husband would not have spent time in the Baltic Sea region if he had known of danger," said Sonja Bruehl, the sick wife, who told Ostsee Zeitung.
A serious disease and damage to blood poisoning and to this family could have been avoided if information had been better available, for example, a site could have been developed in this regard.
LAGUS informed the dpa news office that the following infection situation has been asked by doctors at the beginning of the summer, but no official information was received.
Fresh temperatures have resulted in a higher risk of bacterial disease.
"[Manantan] test results showed a significant reduction in the strain of V. vulnificus," Dr. Will says.
The cool weather's done.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative of the cholera-induced bacteria, is particularly dangerous if a person has chronic liver disease and a reduced immune response, such as HIV or diabetes patients and elderly people.
Men’s risk of disease is higher than women’s, as estrogen has been observed to be protected from pathogens.
If the bacteria get infected, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
After Bacter has been exposed to the wound, the probability of death is about 25%.
The V. vulnicus bacteria can also be infected by eating contaminated seaweeds, although Dr. Willi says that in these cases this is not an infectious condition.
Food pollution from the sea is more common in the southern half of the ball.
In Germany, the V. vulnificus bacteria caused poisoning the previous time in 2010, when two people died of it.
Vieno Kekkonen: The breast was removed due to a suspected cancer
The 80 - year singer Vieno Kekkonen works and works hard, but has also had to be afraid for his health.
I can't believe it's been 80 years since the radiating Vieno Kekkonen.
He himself is amazed how suddenly so many years of age can be.
I didn't realize I was this old.
For 80 years, it sounds like a lot, Vieno Kekkonen laughing.
His birthday, Vieno Kekkonen, spends time with his family.
At the end of August, she was held a birthday party for the folk music and pension society in Karttula, where she lived.
We were on Kekkola's stage in the same place my grandfather was born.
I was ashamed of the party, the birthday girl tells me about the occasion where the stage, measured for three hundred, was full of congratulations.
A few days later, Muhoks was gathered to greet Armi Kusela, whose life Vieno Kekkonen remembers having followed him when he was young.
And now we're both our age!
I'll take Kekkonen to laugh.
During his long career, there are only few aspects that have not been seen in public in Vieno Kekkos.
One thing he has never publicly said: 2006 he was removed from his second breast.
There was an unclear finding in my chest at the point that it was decided to be completely removed.
It was finally no cancer, of course, where I was happy.
In the same surgery, a new breast was made, so it was a rather large measure.
Vieno Kekkonen has not thought of losing his own breast in a way of vain thinking, for information about an unclear finding would have been heavy and cannot be left to bear.
I was just so relieved when there was nothing serious, Vieno Kekkonen tells me and points out that it will be harder for younger people to lose their own chests.

Farmer is made guilty of the state of the sea
The debate on the weak condition of the Baltic Sea and its link to the Finnish agriculture is debilitating.
The voice of experts has been drowned in political opinions on purpose.
In particular, Helsinki Words and Yle, during the summer, haveten the responsibility of agriculture for nutrient emissions to the Baltic Sea.
In the same life, rapid action has been required to control emissions.
The average farmer appears to be a few environmental investigators, and they will help the relevant suppliers in comparison with the over-balanced nutrition expert.
The farmer knows that no food loss can occur if the field is sown with the same amount of nutrients as the harvest is harvested from there.
Almost all farms in Finland are committed to the environmental programme.
It limits the use of fertilisers strictly and requires careful monitoring and reporting of nutrient balances.
The authorities shall monitor compliance with the conditions.
The nutrients stored in the field have been washed into the water bodies even after leaching restrictions, but even for years there has been a clear reduction in emissions.
Farmers have a desire and willingness to continue to work towards reducing nutrient emissions.
But everyone should understand that zero-level access is impossible.
"If we want to have about the amount of agricultural production corresponding to consumption, we must only accept that this is the case", says Jyrki Aakkola, Director of the MTT Environmental Research (MT 29.8).
The past summer brought large bluesmen to the Gulf of Finland.
The researchers were quite unanimous in the fact that the rest received its growth power from the marine phosphorus stocks.
The phosphorus stored in the bottom of the sea is partly a potato from the agriculture of the coastal states over the past decades, but it alone does not explain the stocks.
The cleaning of waste water in cities growing on the Baltic coasts was on the ground until the end of the 20th century.
The problem also concerned large-scale Helsinki waste water and was not seen as a problem as regards pollution on its own shores.
The pollution of the beaches was prevented by building a waste water pipeline to the open sea in the 1980s.
Of course, the quality of water that has been controlled has improved over the years.
The nutrients that have ended up in the sea will not leave, even if the agricultural sector is to cease completely from Finland.
Yet every single debate on seals and the accusations put forward are always directed at agriculture today.
The public debate stamps the farmer's state of affairs in the Baltic Sea.
The prosecution is unreasonable, but it becomes more and more difficult when it is used to carry out political passions.
Under the leadership of its President, Minister for the Environment, Ville Niinistö, the Greens are making major changes to the environmental standards of agriculture.
As a pop-up board, Niinisto has used the rest of the summer conversation.
The Niinistö has very much accused the producer’s association of the MKK’s ageing stock and considered it the most difficult obstacle to water protection.
There should be a limit on political rhetoric.
Most specific projects in the field of water protection are specifically based on cooperation between MTK, farmers and environmental management.
The attacking style of the Niles serves more fishing on the sounds of the city greens than water protection.
I think that's the point.
With hard speech, the Greens are preparing to leave the government behind.
In policy changes, the role of the MTK is to ensure the survival of its members.
It is difficult to sell expensive changes to farmers unless they have a replacement for their costs.
The only money that Ville Niinistö has presented is cuts from other agricultural funds.
Mining tax will not go through: Palmer
The latest attempt by the Abbott government to throw a mine tax on the trash basket seems doomed, for Clive Palmer has declared that his senators will reject it without any change.
The Australian Labour Party is also concerned that the new initiative has included a rule that could limit employers' contributions to compulsory pension payments up to 2034.
The government used qualified majority in Parliament's lower room on Monday to rush through the annulment process in the power of general confusion and in the face of a clearName of the Labour Party.
It set aside the original withdrawal initiative, in which the Senate had previously made significant changes, and replaced it with a new legislative proposal, which it described, above all, taxes, pension contributions, social security and family social assistance.
Originally, it was an initiative aimed at abolishing "unfortunate" mining tax and other decisions, such as a low-income pension fee of $3.6 billion, a bonus for income ($1.3 billion) and a bonus for school-age children ($4.7 billion).
Clive Palmer, Director of the Palmer United Party (PUP) did not accept the transfer of government.
"The planned withdrawal initiative for mine tax is not accepted in the Senate without a low-income pension, a bonus for income support and a bonus for children of school age", he added.
The government needs support from independent parties such as PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
Mr Chris Bowe, Minister of State for the shadows, accused the government of attempting to abolish Parliament's power to decide on the compulsory amount of guarantee for pension payments, giving the Minister of Finance all the power to decide.
"This is unprecedented," he said to journalists in Canberra.
In this way, the government could delay further improvements, with the 12% target of the pension guarantee for the working party moving up to 2034.
"It is not in any way acceptable, and the Labour Party will of course be against all means," Bowen says.
The guarantee now stands at 9.5%, but the government wants to give the finance minister the power to decide whether to stop any further steps to come.
A man's body was found on the Brighton bathing area.
Sussex's police picked up an unidentified man's body before the rise of two afternoons, and the police shut down a area near the beginning of the Volk's Electric Railway tourist phenomenon.
The police and the M.O. are working to find out where the body was found on the beach.
The man hasn't been identified yet.
Researchers are going through the list of missing persons to find out if missing persons have access to the body.
The police were still unable to confirm whether death occurred under suspicious circumstances.
According to the Mexican police, an accidental explosion at the border is one death victim.
According to Piedras Negras, an accidental explosion in the customs building at the border of Mexico and the United States caused the death of one woman and the injury of five other persons.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas acts as the operational director of the local police at the Texas border.
He told the Associated Press News Office that a woman who died on Sunday explosion had skull damage and five others had burn injuries.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion took place this morning at the night of customs officials.
The cause of the explosion is currently under investigation, but the authorities believe that the explosion is in the process of gathering the gases.
The explosion didn't affect border surveillance.
Three Atlantic City Casinos close in September
Three Atlantic City Casinos close their doors this month
He's playing at the Showboat casino, which is supposed to close his door, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
A difficult month of September is expected for Atlantic City, when three casinos share their last cards on the table.
Three casinos will close their doors in Atlantic City this month in New Jersey, which means, at the same time, that this neo-lighted metropolis, known as the nine of money machines, can no longer count on the results of the game.
More than 5,000 employees will be unemployed at the closing of Showboats and Revel casinos this weekend, the Associated Press News Office told us.
More unemployed will come when Trump Plaza puts out his light.
Three casinos, one of which had only been able to act for two years, were expected to be the most recent disaster in the city after the end of the story of the Atlantic Club centre only eight months earlier.
By the end of September more than 25% of the city’s casino workers, 8 000 people, will be unemployed, New York Times writes.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a certain choice for Atlantic City, an AP news agency.
However, the local gambling industry has received a lot more competitors, while the casinos in New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania are blocking a large part of Atlantic City once more.
Even earlier, Massachusetts, who resisted gambling, is looking at his own portion of the amount of money, hoping to welcome the state to three casinos.
TVO: It is difficult to accept the new timetable for Areva
According to the Power of Industry (TVO), it is difficult to accept the new assessment by the plant supplier Areva that the three reactors of Olkiluodo will not be available for commercial use until 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoinen, director of the power plant project, this is due, among other things, to the fact that construction work is already largely ready and that the number of work is known.
TVO will continue to evaluate the information received from Areva.
Silvennoinen points out that TVO welcomes all initiatives to speed up the project.
Areva today provided TVO with an updated timeline of Olkiluto 3, according to which the construction works of the three reactors will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial activities could begin in 2018.
According to Areva’s information, recent delays in the project have mainly resulted in the approval of reactor automation systems which were received in April.
This was the case with TVO for four years.
Olkiluto 3 had to be completed already in 2009, but the timetable has been delayed one time after another.
TVO and Arava have been arguing for years who are responsible for the delay.
It is indisputable in the arbitration order in which Areva has claimed compensation of approximately EUR 2.7 billion from TVO.
In turn, TVO considers Areva to be unfounded and requires about EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation between energy and water actors is needed in the face of global challenges
Today, international leaders met in Stockholm within the framework of the 24th International Week of Water, calling on energy and water players to cooperate to meet the major challenges of our time, to ensure sufficient water and energy production for an ever growing population.
The theme of the 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often interdependent.
Energy is needed for pumping, storing, transporting and cleaning water, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it will affect the other immediately.
These two funds are also an integral part of sustainable development, and they must always be kept in mind when making global decisions.
Torgny Holmgren, CEO of the Stockholm International Water Institute in the Water Week, said in the opening of the water week that "the challenges are huge".
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to grow by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore closer cooperation between energy and water operators is urgently needed in order to find solutions that allow all the peoples of the world to flourish.
This year's water prize, Professor John Briscoe, described water as a basis for growth that needs society as a whole as well as other sectors. Briscoe said that "the developing countries face major challenges.
They have to mobilize these funds.
Briscoe added that "there is no lasting solution to the [water crisis] anywhere".
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form the path.
During the week, representatives will discuss ongoing and future work and cooperation between energy and water operators during more than one hundred seminars, workshops and events.
Professor John Briscoe, originally from South Africa, receives the Stockholm Water Prize His Majesty, King of Sweden Charles XVI, from Kõlja at the ceremony in Stockholm City Hall on Thursday 4 September.
The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that provides research data and information to decision-makers so that they can make decisions that are reasonable for water and sustainable development.
Home flight of dead foreign bodies in Miami: cost of body flying
In October 2012, 23 Cuban refugees in Miami fell and 14 people were reported dead.
The same has happened to hundreds before, and I'm sure this was not the last of its qualities.
Every year, over 1,000 Mediterranean migrants die trying illegally to cross the United States border.
Because of the first town, we're ready to die.
It is ironic, however, that after arriving in the first cities in the country, few plan to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place of residence: either asylum, an effort board upwards or a time point in waiting for a better opportunity.
Few people think they're dying there, and as death approaches, many people are planning to return to their homeland.
In the popular cities of migrants, an disproportionate number of foreigners and temporary residents live abroad and are constantly working on death and return to their homeland.
Approximately 20% of the bodies died in South Florida are flown elsewhere, which is more than anywhere else in the United States.
The majority of human remains (HR, short form of professional slang in terms of human remains) are flown home from an international airport in Miami.
Since 1964, according to Pierson, the largest company in the sector, the CEO, about 80% of this traffic is going abroad. The company is flying bodies to several destinations in Central and South America, as well as to several European countries.

The more migrants move to popular cities, the more they die there.
Even after death, homecoming has its own expense.
Miami is the main airport airport of American Airlines for flights from Latin America, and the figures in the table describe the airline's return to its home country human remains in 2013.
The return of bodies to the home country is not cheap: prices can vary from five hundred to thousands of dollars.
The religious, cultural and public health requirements related to the flight and delivery of human remains differ.
Migrant communities in cities that are popular sometimes organise funeral communities to help with costs, because the return of bodies is expensive, the government does not help in the process, and the dead are often young people who have no insurance.
A number of credit institutions and non-formal health insurance programmes have once been born of entities founded by Italian, Jewish and Greek groups of immigrants living in New York.
The new generations of Mexican, Chinese, Philippines and Bangladeshi migrants are now operating in many of their popular cities.

Death in a foreign country is always a problem, as the few who have moved abroad plan to make their last rester of the colonial city.
For example, in Dubai, with no will for foreigners, the Sharia Act is respected, even if the laws on the recovery of the dead country are different.
The entire property shall be frozen and distributed in accordance with the decision of the Sharia Court.
Aer Lingus (
2013) reflects the size of the city and the Irish population structure.
The airline cut off the service, but resumed it again in 2004 after receiving negative feedback from those who moved from the country.
The idea of death is rarely present as man travels through the popular city of migrants or when he lives there.
On the contrary, temporary or permanent migration to the colonial city is an open declaration of the migrant custom to look at life, not death.
However, the death of a migrant city abroad means making the strongest and most irreparable decisions to move abroad – decisions on whether it wants to belong to a local or global community, to a universe or to a country, to a short term or forever.
The Centre and the Left Union will address the issue of inequality
The opposition parties to the Centre and the Left Alliance are going to ask the government a question of the survival of the low incomes and the increase in inequalities.
The parties want to raise the debate on the problems of people's income, which are driven by poor economic development and aggravating unemployment.
The growing inequality is also visible between the different parts of the country and within the large cities, and the parties note in their communication.
The government’s budget next year’s budget includes cuts and tax increases for low incomes, such as students, unemployed and pensioners, family and ordinary work, while, among other things, food, medicines and housing continue to increase.
In fact, nearly half a million people are unemployed, the parties say in their communications.
The income problems of the unemployed have also deteriorated.
The parliamentary groups of the Conference and the Left will discuss this matter on Thursday.
The third opposition party's fundamental Finns have already announced that they will leave a matter of police and internal security resources.
The parliamentary term of office will start on Tuesday.
The New York City West Indian Day parade is about to begin
The Caribbean culture is once again in New York City, where the West Indian Day parade is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, and the politicians are also seeing each other and coming to see each other.
The annual parade will be held on Monday in Brooklyn.
It takes notice of traditional Carnivals precipitously, and some of them are dancers who carry complex, often made of feathers.
Eric Adams, President of the Brooklyn region, is the festival champion of this year, but there are also many other policy-known faces.
The parade is a great opportunity for present and candidate politicians to greet the audience a week before the elections.
In spite of the festive parties, there has been violence during the past few years.
Police have said that they are trying to keep the event safe by means of additional measures, including monitoring the activities of nearby gangs.
Do you even want to ask the retorical questions?
Everyone knows the retortic questions, don't they?
I don't think that's worth answering that question.
This figure of language, i.e. a question that is not expected to be answered, but which implies a certain response in the direction of both high-level speech and more everyday speech exchange.
The initial words of Cicero's famous Catilina's prosecution are chain retorical questions, the first of which is "How long, O Catilina, are you going to take advantage of our patience?"
The same applies to my wife's questions: "Why shouldn't I warm up five days old chicken?"
Why are you so tense?
The difference is a more fine word for a retort question.
The power of the rectorical question lies in the fact that the issue is open, and the public is inclined to accept the question.
The mysteriously retortic question suggests that no one would agree with that.
In the 19th century, the writer David Williams described the rector question as "some of the words that have been shown to be wonderfully designed to produce a strong sense of the truth of something about the subject, while the challenge they are faced is not to disagree".
Reconciliation
Retorical questions can be asked after if you want to achieve more ambitious goals.
Several retorical questions that are designed to express grief or anxiety are called epilepsy.
For example, Job used them when he appealed to the Almighty, "What good do you do for me that you're going to fuck me--?"
Do you have eyes similar to ours?
Do you see the way man sees?
There are also the chains of rhetorical questions in my wife's comments: "Why did you cause food poisoning to children?
Are you out of your mind?
Can't you do anything right?
In addition, there is a so-called hypophora, which is the case when the question is asked and the question is answered immediately.
Isaac Hayes offers an excellent example of this: "Who is the black private egg that is the sexual fear for all women?
Parru!
That's right!
Who would sacrifice his life for his brother?
More examples from my wife: "What is the only food that the children have eaten and where can they get used to?"
This chicken.
Who the hell fed it to them?
You.
Strangely, the retorical question is not usually trying to bend, even though rhetoric means bending skills.
If you try to talk to someone all over the world instead of trying to preach to those who have already turned around or be discouraged from someone’s stubbornness, you might want to take advantage of the rhetorical questions.
They are more useful in trying to reconcile views than trying to get one to accept one’s own opinion.
If the public agrees with the claim "Not nice when it's so sunny out there?", the retorical question tells us that the speaker is sure of his claim, which binds the speaker and the public better.
However, this only happens if the speaker is sure that there are no different opinions.
By assuming that consensus has been reached instead of reaching consensus, the speaker can seem to be self-evident.
In other situations, the retorical question refers to the weak argument.
In the headlines of the papers, the retortic question is too often the most clearly strong possible argument in very weak cases: "Did space creatures use pyramids?"
In both cases, there is a risk that the question may lead to a response that is different from the suggested answer.
"Do you think the same thing we do?" was part of the British Conservative Party's risk campaign clause in general elections in 2005.
The party's gone.
Some of these cases have become a hobby, and so is QTWAIN’s questions (the concept of the British supplier John Renntoul, known as Questions To Which Answer Is No, questions whose answer is not) are popular.
A few years ago, one of my friends arranged a competition that was looking for the best examples.
The competition clearly won the song "Do You Wanna Be In My Gang?", which sang the pop star Gary Glitter before he appeared to be a child's sexual abuser.
The author has also written the book "You Talkin" to Me?"
Researcher: The Federal Commission may be over
At the beginning of the conflict, many countries still thought that the federal state could be some kind of compromise to the conflict, says Saari.
Formerly, the Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with the Russian channel that the peace in eastern Ukraine would require discussions on the state station in the region.
In practice, this would mean some form of self-government in Eastern Ukraine.
According to Putin, it would protect the legal rights of the East residents.
According to Saare, the transformation of Ukraine into a federal state is, in a way, a priority for Russia's objectives.
Ukraine will certainly have no reason to doubt that Russia would then try to influence Ukraine's internal policy, he says.
If there is no federal solution, another option could be, from Russia's point of view, some kind of frozen conflict, in which Russia would practically control Luhansk and Donetsk, Saari's assessment.
The West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending weapons and soldiers to the east.
Russia has contested the arguments, even though, for example, the rebels of Russia have told us that their troops have fought 'sold voluntary Russian soldiers'.
Head of Up: Katainen’s proposed effective task
The brickman reminds me that the image is new and is becoming new.
According to him, the idea is that Katainen would somehow coordinate or even lead to the Commission's work on matters relating to competitiveness and employment.
Of course, one of the Commission's priorities for the new season's programme is the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That is how the Commission is at the heart of the Commission, says Tiilikainen.
The brick believes that Kataise's background, knowledge of the economy and role in the economic crisis will give her the opportunity to play a good role within the Commission.
According to the plans, the task would be unblocked, i.e. Kata would not be subject to its own DG.
Instead, Katais would be a team leader in the EU's competitiveness and employment sectors, which would allow him to have portfolios in addition to the economic Commissioner's portfolio, with other portfolios in the field being co-ordinated.
In practice, the management of the team could mean, for example, planning and guidance.
Mothers of soldiers: up to 15 000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Military Mothers Organization, up to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine in the past two months, and over 7 000 Russian soldiers are currently present.
According to human rights organisations, at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
According to the organization, the hospital in Rostov, near the Ukrainian border, is marked by wounded in the Ukrainian war.
The mothers of soldiers collect their records from the soldiers' relatives.
The military union NATO has estimated that over a thousand Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
BB-Andte from his alcohol use: "A little after a drink, there will be a case"
Big brother Jussi and Andte got on Monday night to think about the life of the BB house.
Jussi, on the side of the basement, was riding a fitness bike on Monday night with Andte from Kartano's residents.
The two were wondering what they were doing to the viewers of the program.
Not until you've seen it, Andte said.
Jussi thinks that most of the time in BB House is waiting and spending time.
Possible parties or tasks make up only part of BB House life.
Well, more than that, we wait and wonder and talk and live.
And you, Anne and Jussi.
On Wednesday the people of Kartano spent the night in wet signs, and the alcohol especially turned on Andte’s phone.
If so, Andtel asked whether the party had made a man’s life more meaningful in the house now that he had been able to talk to these other residents in a small hippocalypse.
A little drink to take, and then there's a case, Andte admitted it.
Look at Andte's interview on the ISTV video!
Anna Abreu reveals her body plan in Me Nais
Anna Abreu says in Me Women's magazine that she decided to lose two years ago when she was in surgery.
At that time, the tired man, Anna, thought he was getting more energy with his dilution.
Fred Montana / Spanish News
Give me a dream a few years ago about the type of body of Victoria's Secret models.
My body idea was a Victoria's Secret style.
I wanted to look good, and I thought I wanted to lose weight, Anna would tell the paper.
After training his body with gigs and music videos, Anna says that she's not a luster, even though he's been named that way.
Viena Kytöjoki
Anna in Timm's condition is working out at the gym and she's doing boxing.
The muscles I see are not important to me, but the fact that I get a certain amount of weight raised in the gym is something that Anna points out.
Sometimes the pop star gives itself permission to ruble.
If I'm agitated, I'm really agitated.
Sometimes I pull unhealthful dudes, and I don't think if there were more pounds.
Instead, I wonder what my body thinks.
If I do something bad to my body, I'm gross.
Superintendent
Anna says she's enjoying her body.
Corporate profit sharing pleases shareholders but does not increase growth
Did Australian stock managers today only try to please a large number of shareholders by agreeing on a larger distribution of profits and buying back their shares?
Is the decision-making power shifting from corporate governments to shareholders served by the government?
The distribution of profits was the most important one, and it appeared last week at the end of the reporting period.
The prices of shares of companies that have awarded investors in the form of buy-back programmes and the distribution of more profits have been clearly increased.
And there's nothing wrong with it.
However, the turning point of the coin is that capital consumption will be reduced more rapidly than the analysts have predicted, and this fact will allow many to ask whether too much emphasis will be placed on short-term popularity and whether sufficient focus will be on growth in the near future and in the long-term.
Some companies will, of course, return money to shareholders and finance business by other means.
More funding will be obtained, for example, from cheap stock markets.
From a company's point of view, this makes sense because the loan is currently cheap, whereas capital is not.
However, even if it is not taken into account in the loan markets, it is clear that the openness to shareholders is financed primarily by the fact that the company uses less money to invest.
The net result of this wave of purchase programmes (and withdrawal of profits investment plans) is the decrease in capital on the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls this reporting period "the period of the decrease in capital", during which companies have tried to keep the number of shares at all levels to a low level.
As part of the same plan, companies increasingly have less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the redemption programmes was EUR 3.7 billion and the value of the expected unrealised capital procurement programmes was EUR 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far that it considers capital consumption to be a curse in a title of its report.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, there have been unofficial evidence for months.
The Director of the Australian Central Bank, Glenn Stevens, had to point out a few weeks ago that companies needed a little more 'war spirit' to increase investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the future prospects of individual companies, but about the overall impact on the economy, as low capital consumption generally results in negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse is said to have calculated on average four per cent of the consumption of their capital over the previous two years.
On average, the consumption of free cash flow has increased by two per cent.
Improving the cash flow is likely to increase capital consumption.
This quick look seems good from the point of view of current shareholders and the stock market, but it is also some kind of evidence of corporate obedience.
If I could get a coin every time the CEO has said that the price of the share for a short time is not important, I would be... well, it's easy to guess the end of the sentence.
Of course, this argument is not true.
CEOs are very closely following stock prices and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
Short and long-term bonus packages are defined according to the value of shares and the position of managers depends on it.
CEOs would like to say that some decisions (if they are business, increased investment in organisation or distribution of profits) may not always be immediately popular, but they are useful for a medium-term strategy.
In fact, business leaders are often complaining about the fact that there is a very short-term approach in the investment market.
That is why the current gap in conservativeness seems to have reached short-term objectives.
However, it was too clear that the weight was too much for reducing the consumption of future capital and that the most sustainable companies were encouraged.
Large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, considered the first player in the reduction of capital consumption, but also many other companies did the same – part of the sanctions and part because they feared the reaction of shareholders.
Why, then, do investors pressure companies to share profits?
According to Credit Suisse’s strategic strategy, it is clear that shareholders want more income, since the profits of other more traditional fixed-income investment products have been reduced since, by surprise, the central banks have calculated interest rates worldwide in order to bring more money to the market.
As a result, investors have been forced to look for profits on the capital market and, in turn, pressure companies to distribute more profits.
Shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies whose profit distribution is uncertain.
Investors would prefer money as more and more investors approach retirement age in the same way.
The statistics for the previous reporting period clearly show that the distribution of profits was influenced by the cost cuts of companies and not by the increase in turnover.
The leaking of public images appears to be a data leak or an e-mail account breaking
According to Jennifer Lawrence's photos and some sources, the unknown hacker leaked videos on the Internet is surprised by information security experts and Apple.
Although the hacker has published lists of female publicity persons in one chatroom and said that he has more pictures of women, some of them have reported that their images have been faked while others have said that it was a long time ago about photos removed.
Many are described and many have been called Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and American actress Mary E Winstead.
After hacking, the biggest question is what was done by the attack.
And were the pictures and videos real and what was they downloaded from?
The source that has most appeared in the news is the most unlikely alternative – an inconspicuous and thorough attack on Apple iCloud’s service.
Large companies like Apple have invested in information security teams working inside the house, which are responsible for trying to penetrate the company regularly into their own systems.
"A large scale hacking into Apple's iCloud service is unlikely.
Nor does the original publisher claim that the claim should be valid", notes Rik Ferguson, Vice-President of the Information Safety Research Unit of Trend Micro.
A simpler and more likely explanation for these hacks of publicity (and for people with less famous names every day) is the leaking of an e-mail address and password, whether by guessing or using a kapsies, i.e. by scamming a person to log in with information about a genuine site, and then using this information against them.
Apple continues to examine the alleged attack on the iCloud service used in iPhone phones for recording settings and, above all, the security copy of images when they are transferred to the Cloud server.
You can log in to your account by issuing this email address and password in iCloud service, and then download their photos and other information from your account.
This can only be prevented if the account holder has introduced a two-step identification ("two factor authentication", 2FA), i.e. additional protection against intrusion, when the owner's mobile phone is sent the code before the account can be registered.
However, relatively few uses of the 2FA properties, either because they are not known or because they are considered to be indiscriminate.
Apple continues to examine whether all data are from its iCloud service, and if so, how widely user accounts were entered.
The company has not delivered an opinion on this matter at the time of the original version of this text.
Ferguson considers it possible that the hacker has used the "Do you forget the password" link in Apple iCloud's service first by collecting e-mail addresses from the public persons, for example from the address book of the second hacked device.
It is also possible that celebrities have used the same password in a number of services, when passwords were captured through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's photos claims that the images are real, but don't tell me when they're taken.
Winstead said that it could be a long-term hacking company.
These pictures were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this required a terrible effort.
I feel compassion for all others who are targeted by hacking," he wrote in his Tweet.
However, independent IT expert Graham Cluley points out that Winstead may have removed the images from his mobile phone, but removing the image from the modern smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the image.
Modern smartphones regularly record images in the cloud service because they often do not have room for a large number of images taken by the user.
Apple's iPhone standard setting is the recording of images to iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft's Windows phones to record images to OneDrive.
Independent service providers, such as Dropbox, offer automatic images and data storage services.
People take and remove pictures, but they don't understand that images are downloaded from the account,"Cluley says The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: "The deleted doesn't always mean that he's removed," he says.
You can keep pictures and videos for years.
If someone reaches the user's e-mail address and password, they can reload all photos and videos sent by email.
You can download pictures of Apple's service to Mac, Windows PC, or any Apple device.
The hacker published a screenshot that was claimed to display videos and images from Windows PC, which are currently not published.
Two-stage identification protects against such hacking, as it requires everyone who is trying to copy an existing account to another device, to give the original user to the device, usually a mobile phone sent code.
Without the code, access to the account will be prevented.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo offer a two-stage recognition account, but it is not yet known whether the public concerned were using the service, or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the images they claim to have are not real.
Aria Grande's representative has said that the pictures that Grande claims to have are "fully faked".
Victoria Justice wrote in her papers: "I'm the one who's been taken down by someone who doesn't understand.
Let me cut off the roots from the rumors right away.
Cluley's bringing up the second option.
Since the hacking were individuals of publicity, their accounts may have been broken down by someone who managed their social media accounts or regularly managed their email.
"I would like to know if the actors' agencies or some representative have a part in it," he asks.
However, those persons do not use one publisher or agency.
The second alternative is that someone who installed or helped with one or more systems of the victim's security attack and changed the secret system so that all information can be returned.
This happened in the case of Christopher Chaney, the Dutch hacker, where the hacker distributed photos of Scarlet Johansson and Mila Kunis e-mails in 2011 and was sentenced to 10 years in December 2012. He was also ordered to pay over $66 000 in damages.
Chaney was accused of entering the e-mail accounts of more than 50 people in the entertainment industry in secret between November 2010 and October 2011. In one case, he asked Aguilera for pictures of this stylistic star as a minor, and then published pictures online.
Later, Chaney asked for forgiveness, saying that his actions "are certainly one of the worst violations of privacy that you can imagine".
Chaney was also claimed to be covering two people online for more than ten years.
According to Cluley, "In the case of Chaney, the stars' e-mail accounts were broken, and they were changed so that someone sent their information forward even after the password was changed."
Cluley says that the coercive activity of hacking hackers "remembers the gathering of butterflyes" on these accounts.
They just want to collect this kind of information.
In this case, it is possible that someone had encountered a list of services such as Dropbox that contain the information and login data on these accounts.
The hackers have also been able to try to intrude for a long time.
or they had access to information on an email account, such as the address book, and then fished information on other persons.
I don't think it's a simple iCloud safety window.
Australia has offered its intelligence service to help the UN track 44 peacekeepers who were kidnapped by terrorists involved in al-Qaida in Syria.
The terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusra is believed to have held 44 Fijin peacekeepers in custody, which captured the crossing site in Golan's hills last week and forced UN troops to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since Wednesday, and there is no information about their location.
At the same time, the Ministers of the United Nations Conference on Small Developing Islands, including the Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are very concerned about what has happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with UN Secretary-General Ban ki-Mon at the summit, and he has offered Australia's help to save the peacekeepers in the lost.
"I have assured you that Australia will help the United Nations in everything it can to provide, for example, intelligence service help," she said to the AAP news service from Samoa on Monday.
We're very close to all the partners and friends in the intelligence network -- to ensure that we can locate them and that they're safe.
Bishop has already assured the Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and the Foreign Minister of Ratu Inoke Kubuabola that Australia is using its position at the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, the Philippines peacekeeping team held in their military chambers reportedly escaped in different parts of the same controversial region.
The United Nations has been monitoring the Golan hills since the outbreak of Syria and Israel in 1974.
Fleets are trying to steal your money through an initiative to set aside carbon tax, to warn the Australian Competition Authority ACCC
Fleets are using the carbon tax withdrawal initiative to steal money, ACCC warns.
The SCAMwatch unit has warned consumers and businesses not to rely on too good voiced offers from government agencies offering thousands of dollars of credit.
Fleets may use the figures seen in the media to prove to the consumer how much he can save when buying goods after the abolition of the carbon tax and offering it up to $7 000, the warning says.
Fleets may sound very convincing because they have determined the victim’s personal data that they use to try to obtain banking information or to get the victim to pay the fee.
They're discussing current topics to deceive the victim.
Fleets use more than carbon tax to get in touch with money, their stories are more advanced, and they use timely things to build a scam around them.
Also, on the plane of the Malaysian Airlines, MH370 lost aircraft and Robin Williams' death have inspired cheaters.
The ACCC advises the company to contact the company by means of its own contact details instead of the contact information provided by the caller if the identity of the caller representing the company is least suspicious.
If you receive an unexpected call or an email from someone who claims to represent a government agency or company, such as an energy company, and that you are entitled to compensation for the abolition of carbon tax, please be careful.
If you believe that you have been deceived and provided personal information or transferred money to a fraud account, please contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true – for example, free money shared by the government – it is likely to be.
Economic Areas: Lipponen abuses the EU's Russian sanctions
The former Prime Minister, Mr Lipponen, criticises the sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia in the interview with economic statements.
Russia's focus on politics is on its own interests.
There is no need for this," Lipponen says in the interview.
Lipponen has started work as a business investigator in the EC Arctic regions of the Central Business Union.
He is concerned that the EBRD and the European Investment Bank, as part of the EU's economic sanctions, interrupted Russia's project funding.
"It means, for example, that projects of the northern dimension with clear vision go to the ice," Lipponen says in the interview.
The freezing of funding is now detrimental to the cooperation that Lipposen believes can be difficult if there is no trust.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in cooperation projects in the Arctic region continues to be as high as before.
He is currently reporting to the EC on the Arctic policy of Finland and the possibilities for companies in the north.
It does not affect the situation in Ukraine or the situation in Russia.
The report will look forward, talk about tens of years," he says.
Rarely, the elephant becomes a low water or a nearby facility, says the nature pedagogic Vesa Heinonen's Museum of the North Pole.
On Sunday, in the summer village of Vasa, we saw an elephant swimming near the beach.
According to Heinosen, the elephant is likely to have arrived after the Summer Bay Food.
It's not crazy.
This means there's fish in the area, Heinonen's tip.
According to him, for example, on Sundom’s bridge, we will see Norwegians, especially in spring and autumn, which arrive specifically after fish.
Norppa is still not a common species in the Pacific Sea.
There's Norwegians on the payside, and he's going on.
Norppi lives, amongst other things, in the North Sea and in the island Sea.
According to the South Australian court, the murdered pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga behaved aggressively and violently outside the nightclub
Murdered by a South-Easter pizzeriano named Robert Vallelon.
In the trial of the court, it has been found that the pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga behaved aggressively both to his partner and to his security officer only minutes before he was killed outside the club.
In the lower court court of Adelaide, lawyers accused of killing Vallelonga asked their client to be released against bail because it was a "clear" self-defence.
Marie Shaw, QC, said that the case was not serious enough to keep his client, whose identity has not been published, behind the tents until the trial.
According to the evidence, the dead behaved so aggressively that he had to be removed from the club," he said.
After that, this 40-year-old drunk man began to rip off the security guard's shirt.
It is important to note that according to the prosecutor, death was caused by one attack, which clearly refers to self-defence or to the defence of the other.
A 25-year-old man is still being charged with murder.
Vallelonga, 44, found unconsciously near the crossing of Rundle St and Synagogue Place at about 2.25 a.m. on May 4, she had severe head injuries.
He died in his injuries at the royal hospital in Adelaide the next day, with friends and pizzeria customers dying of the "local legend" of One Tree Hill.
According to the prosecutors, there was no cause for the murder of the accused, and after the incident, he said to the taxi driver, "it was that he put someone to bed for a few days."
But now the video footage of the security camera proves something else, Shaw says.
"It confirms that the dead behaved aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down, and he himself became involved in the hard and violent conduct," he says.
Our client has both the assumption of innocence and the evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
The prosecutors opposed the man's release because only one of the three security officers on the ground at night had been missing from Vallelonga's behavior.
They said that he was not threatened by other security guards because he was "a short one," and he used the word storage of a big man because he wanted to avoid a physical conflict.
They said that the cab driver who saw the case clearly would prove that Vallelonga was "very strong" and that he did not have the opportunity to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered the man to be arrested until the next week, when he would declare his decision.
The contested dolphin hunt began in Japan - based on tradition - Foreign news - Night Sanomat
Bad weather was expected to slow down the world, largely at the beginning of bad hunting.
In the Japanese city of Taij, a new annual period of dolphin hunting was launched on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
A great deal of opposition from all over the world to the hunt is reported by the British magazine Guardian.
In the yachts, hunters drive hundreds of dolphins into a remote bay where mammals are slaughtered after the most suitable individuals have been selected for transport to dolphins and theme parks around the world.
The body of dolphins also ends up in food.
However, according to local authorities, the beginning was expected to be delayed due to poor weather.
Information on practice spread to the world in 2009 as a result of a documentary film entitled The Cove.
During the previous hunting seasons, diplomats have been critical not only of the animal protectors.
According to the respondents, dolphin meat has in any case a limited market due to its high mercury content.
This is a tradition, including the Japanese Government.
The defenders have also pointed out that dolphins are not endangered.
Delphine hunting was opposed already during the weekend in many countries.
In Tokyo, protestors said that it was a threat to Japan’s reputation in the world.
In Helsinki, too, a demonstration was held in front of the Japanese Embassy on Monday.
Some NATO member states are uncertain about investing new troops in Eastern Europe
Within NATO, the military union’s views are divided as to whether or not it should establish NATO’s base points in Eastern Europe and the Baltic region in response to the Ukrainian crisis, reports Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have asked the military union to bring permanent troops to their countries, but the German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been against the plan.
"Ukraine has given a new perspective on Russia's policy, and it threatens to undermine European security," told Michael Clarke Financial Times, Director of the Royal United Services Institute of London.
NATO Member States are gathered in the beginning of the week and the military union is due to publicise its new contingency plans.
The key question of the plan is whether NATO can break the TAE agreement on conventional weapons signed in 1990.
The NATO and the Warsaw Federation agree on how they will invest armed forces in the Atlantic and Ural Mountains.
In practice, according to the Financial Times, the agreement prevents new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltic States.
Russia itself frozen its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not actually withdraw the agreement.
In view of the tightening situation in Ukraine, NATO will consider whether the terms of the agreement still need to be complied with.
"Nato's resources must be available in all the NATO countries that need resources," said Sir Malcolm Rifkind Financial Times, Chairman of the Committee on Security of the British Parliament.
Matt Guthmler's youngest flying around the world
When other teenagers learned how to drive, Matt Guthmler learned how to fly.
The 19-year-old Guthmiller became the youngest of the world – and yet alone, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
In South Dakota, young people flew 30 000 miles, stopping 23 times in 15 different countries in five different continents.
On his way to Guthmler was treated as a rock star thanks to his record flight filter.
Guthmler also heard critical comments:
"It's too risky" and "Some spoiled, rich kid just wants to see a little world and have fun".
Guthmler did not have much to say to speakers of such comments.
Of course, I enjoyed a lot of fun, but it also included a lot of work, and I hope that, at my record, I will also encourage other people to go to the world and do great things.
He asked his parents to eat at the airport cafes first.
Later, he insisted on getting to flight classes.
My parents let me go to a short, $20, 20-minute tour flight, but I think that at that time, I think that my enthusiasm would stop.
No, he didn't.
Guthmler soon made an agreement with his parents to allow him to have more time at the cab.
I agreed to share a car with my father throughout the high school instead of getting my own car.
I could fly planes at the change shop.
By 17 years of age, Guthmler had received a licence, and two years later, he put a single Beechcraft plane for his alone flight around the world.
A young man studying at MIT University held the maintenance of the plane himself and made fuel calculations.
Many hours above also meant that he himself needed an additional guarantee —
practically a lot of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmler says he's eaten a few cookies all over a long flight.
Flying to the clouds was both amazing and scary.
Air traffic controllers in other countries did not have regulation to help them navigate around storms.
I had no idea which clouds were just a little above the plane and which were up to 45,000 feet and torn into pieces of the plane.
Guthmler's plane was not pressurized and was not equipped with oxygen, so he could not fly above the clouds.
The fuel volume of the machine would never have been higher.
On the day after the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died on a flight between American Samoa and Hawaii, which Guthmler calls into the most difficult part of his journey.
Guthmler flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he felt that the rise is technically challenging due to the large amount of fuel required for a 16-hour flight.
However, despite the risks and even high standards of the place, Guthmler managed to break the record and collect money for ATK training through the Code.org website.
He's a coder himself, and he started his own business at 12 years of age.
Guthmler's goals are in the sky.
I wish it were nice to set up the next Apple, but let's see what happens now.
In any case, Guthmler is going to target a high level.
Aim for the sky and you can achieve something great.
It's more difficult to find a real franchise entrepreneur than you think.
Lori Joyce was excited about the fans waiting for his Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores all over Canada after Canada's W TV channel started to show the Cupcake Girls toosi-tov program in 2009.
The innovation continued until it became clear that one of the French entrepreneurs was not a suitable task.
"My French businessman was sitting in his car and he called me that one hundred potential customers are waiting outside the store to buy a cake and he can't stand the situation," Joyce says.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge lost opportunity for us.
After the event, Joyce decided to change the leadership of the French partners from the selection process to highlight the company's cultural leadership rather than the bakery.
"Whoever can shine at the interview -- they know what I want to hear," he says, adding that he's been having about 100 interviews for each 11 French movement.
We start with six weeks of training, but the workers work completely differently in the working environment, so the whole process is quite difficult, and therefore we have above all emphasis on the appropriateness of business culture.
Finding the right French company is vital to the development of any small company.
A strong and honest leader is able to edit and increase the organisation, while a poorly functioning leader may cause expensive damage to the company.
"before I thought that looking for a French business is like going on a date, but it's not true at all, you can do much to get to know one another before you get married," says Joyce.
Instead, in the case of a French partner, a contract is signed, a security is secured and a new store is built.
Getting in partnership with someone before you see how a person works is a huge step and a significant test of trust.
The symbiotic relationship between the French partners reminds a strong marriage, as they have common goals, explains Lorraine McLachlan, Chairman and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
That is why McLachlan believes that the French business operator should also be careful when choosing the future French sponsor before taking up such a long-term partnership.
"This is the same idea as human relationships: if a date partner is rude already on a date, imagine what he's like in a marriage?" he says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose carefully and assess future contractual partners and to pay attention to the smallest alarm marks on either side.
McLachlan adds that French artists like Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time those who act as a French-analyser must be more careful when choosing the first, most important partners.
On the other hand, the new French entrepreneurs have to decide, on the basis of a highly successful parent company, what challenges they have to face and what skills the new French entrepreneurs need when faced with similar difficulties.
For the first time, companies acting as French sensors can also ask for the help of the French advisor to create a profile based on industry's practices.
McLachlan also points out that for the first time those who act as French-antians and entrepreneurs have a lot of help on the CFA website at Loakforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will make it easier later, because the French entrepreneurs will learn to evaluate potential entrepreneurs better, but also because the first French entrepreneurs can give advice and help with the evaluation.
“The founder and CEO of Brian (Scudamore, 1-800 GOT-JUNK) in this story,” says Erik Church, Managing Director of O2E Brands. “O2E Brands’ business include 1-800 GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
The French entrepreneurs helped Brian create something he couldn't have created alone, so the first French entrepreneurs need to choose this idea in mind.
Under Church there are 216 French entrepreneurs representing all three brands of O2E, and he is also a partner of You Move Me Toronto Franchise.
The Chruch method is simple to find a true French partner.
"A different test of confidence to be used for us is to ask yourself, "Do I want this person to join me in the barbecue for the weekend?", he says.
"If the answer to this question is 'en', you probably do not want to spend much of your working day looking for solutions to major business challenges with them."
Church also points out that O2E Brands is largely thanked for its success in the French architecture.
In a business organisation, leaders often see their position as very formal in the short term and in relation to lower management levels, whereas the French entrepreneurs take a partnership with long-term objectives and are thus more committed to the success of the company.
"The French partnership has a much more positive side compared to the traditional business structure, but the partnership is also much more intensive," he says.
This is a partnership, not a relationship between the Vice-President and the local operational manager.
Such a partnership is more difficult, but well-managed, it produces better results.
Rail delays lower cereals prices in northern United States
Late rail transport has led to a significant fall in the prices of cereals in the north of the United States, weeks before a huge harvest is expected to be under new pressure on the transport network.
Commercial cereals in the North Dakota state offer farmers only $2.7 from the bus station - about a dollar less than the guide prices - as a primary reason for ensuring the capacity of the rail lines to be received, they say traders and agricultural organisations.
IN Raka materials
The problems are among the most acute Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway railways, as well as the Canadian Pacific railway company.
The federal railway supervisor will hold a hearing on service problems on Thursday.
In the northern plains, it is necessary to rely on railways for the transport of agricultural products because they are far from river networks.
The delay in the carriage of trains increased when a very cold winter followed by a large harvest in 2013 which caused the slowing and shortening of trains.
Some farmers believe that the increased transport of crude oil from North Dakota Bakken's oil smelt has set aside the transport of cereals, which is not true according to the railway companies.
According to the director of an international cereal trade company, the costs of marketers storing and transferring cereals for ensuring the use of the train have increased from zero to up to $2,000 to $3,000 per year.
Someone has to pay the cost.
"These costs will be paid either by the farmer or by the client," says the director of the cereal business.
The U.S. Agriculture Agency estimates the increase in the North Dakota soya crop by more than one third and that of the spring crop by 16%.
According to Randy Gordon, president of the National Grain and Feed Association, "We normally try to start a new harvest from a pure table, i.e. sufficient storage space has been emptied to the harvest and the grain has been sold and transferred.
But now we are going to start late for last year's service problems.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will deal smoothly with the transport of this year's harvest.
John Miller, Vice-President of BNSF, responsible for the transport of agricultural products, said that the company has reduced the number of long-term transports (passengers ordered by customers for which more than four days have passed) from the beginning of April to 16 500, about two thousand.
"We have moved almost all the old harvest we were supposed to move," says Miller, referring to the remaining grain from the previous harvest.
However, the latest reported speeds of BNSF grain trains were 9 per cent lower than in the second quarter of last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Miller admits that the development is 'unfair' but pointed out that the company is currently investing $5 billion in capital this year in order to improve the handling capacity of all types of transportable products such as cereals.
The speed of Canadian Pacific trains affected by the second misfortune is 11 per cent lower than at the same time last year, but clearly higher than the high low speeds of early year.
The Canadian Pacific railway undertaking has told the railway supervisor (Surface Transport Board) that its changes to the system of ordering trains should improve its ability to deal with traffic during the 15-20% season.
"The action plan for the autumn of the Canadian Pacific railway company focuses on the continuous improvement of trains' speed and the efficient exploitation of trains, so that we can deliver more and more train wagons every week", said the representative of the railway company.
Ukraine's crisis may resolve NATO's "identity crisis"
Directors, diplomats and experts from large countries have often been concerned about NATO's future and whether the conclusion of the NATO mission will also mean NATO itself.
However, this concern is very premature, as is apparent at the NATO summit in Wales Cardiff this week, involving 60 leaders, including US President Barack Obama.
The mission list of politicians and diplomats has no shortage of the world's crises, even to the extent that the exit of Afghan troops, which used to be a priority, is no longer the most important issue.
On the other hand, 28 states' alliances are needed after Russia reintegrated to Ukraine, and this is a shocking reminder that the threat of Europe's independence is not necessarily just part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways of punishing Russia, but they will also transfer troops, promise more money for defence expenditure and re-commit to defence society.
In some respects NATO is the praise of Vladimir Putin.
"It (NATO) was looking for its purpose in some way -- and it had a fairly significant identity crisis going on," says Heather Conley, Head of the European programme of the European Institute for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
NATO has not only found a new purpose, but has also confirmed it.
Obama has also added a new mission to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to get world leaders to set up a common strategy for the destruction of Islamic militias that quickly reach popularity in Iraq and Syria.
According to official opinions, the President will face important challenges in trying to stimulate his military response to war-free partners, in particular that would cross the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to show that he will lead the world to find a strategy to overcome the extreme Islamists, first of all saying that "we do not have a strategy".
Western experts have put cautionary expectations at the summit on whether there will be breakthroughs in Ukraine or Islamic State discussions.
Additional economic sanctions are planned to be the main tool for the event called the Ukraine attack on Russia.
The officials of the European Union discussed this during the weekend, but postponed the decision on new sanctions.
The US officials pointed out that countries from which Obama wishes the main partners in the Islamic issue are not necessarily NATO members.
The collapse of the problems could not be predicted two years ago, when the previous NATO summit was held in Chicago, when the debate was ruled by the withdrawal of the soldiers from Afghanistan.
One year earlier, Robert M. Gates, the leader of that time, took the final floor in order to say that the organisation has reached a "common military relevance" point.
U.S. officials were constantly complaining that other countries were unable to reach their funding targets.
NATO members promise to spend 2% of their GDP on defence expenditure, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, the United States and the United States – have achieved this objective last year.
But now the White House officials say they've noticed a change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff which promises to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were still discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time the company had a genuine desire for the potential threats to their true composition in the Member States.
Following Russia's entry into Ukraine, the defence promises are more important and important than once after the end of the Cold War," says Charles Kopchan, President of the United States National Security Council.
We are quite hopeful that we will reach agreement between the 28 Member States.
Obama is using a large part of his journey to strengthen its commitment to defence cooperation in the interests of the worrying neighbouring countries of Russia.
The President begins his three-day trip to Tallinn, Estonia, where he meets the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has recycled its troops in Estonia since Russia joined the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula this year, and NATO troops will be recycled regularly in Estonia when a new contingency plan, which will be published this week, will be put in place.
The plan aims to shorten the time NATO needs to respond to attacks in border countries, officials say.
The plan includes increasing air surveillance and other visible defence cooperation marks.
The changes present a small risk for NATO, which refrained from establishing permanent support points for Eastern and Central Europe as a demonstration of friendship with Russia.
According to the officials, the new plan does not necessarily break the agreement, but it can also be merely a semantic difference, says a Western diplomat who did not want to be called public before the official information.
NATO's presence is likely to be described as long-term, not permanent, the diplomat said.
By Putin's effective "talviese", does he use it to Ukraine?
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has one at his foot with regard to Ukraine.
The Western countries and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putinia of rebellisation in eastern Ukraine and of sending Russian troops to Ukraine.
That is why the West has made sanctions to Russia.
Once Ukraine is tightened, the Western countries are planning harder sanctions against Russia.
However, Russia has a power card: winter is coming, and Ukraine is the main source of energy.
According to the American authorities, Ukraine's primary energy sources are natural gas (40%) and coal (28%), Geysar Gurbanov, which is active at Harvard University, according to Business Insider.
When winter comes to Ukraine in less than four months, and coal mines are located in the eastern part of the country's conflict, Ukrainians are frozen in their homes when gas supply from Russia falls.
Therefore, if rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, the Russian energy waste, will help Putin win the war at the end, Gurbanov writes.
Last year half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine on 16 July due to outstanding invoices.
Earlier this month, Gazprom announced that by 1 August, Ukraine's debt on gas was EUR 5.3 billion (approximately EUR 4 billion).
According to the New York Times, Putin commented on the coming winter as follows:
I don't think anyone thinks about it anymore, except Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways to facilitate the solution.
Firstly, the immediate cessation of hostilities and the correction of the necessary infrastructure.
In order to complete the stocks, the necessary corrections must be made and reserved for the cold period.
According to Business Insider, Putin's comment can be interpreted as a masked threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat before the Separatists, Moscow may use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman, a Japanese holding company in Nomura, pointed out last month that Russia's talks on humanitarian issues and the planning of a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine would increase in a few months if Russia could maintain Separatists until then.
It has already been announced from Moscow that Ukraine will have to pay in advance for future gas supplies, unless the Kiev sector will pay for the accumulated debts.
The EU will try to negotiate an agreement which would allow temporary gas imports to continue.
Last week, Prime Minister of Ukraine, Arseni Jatsenuk, said that Russia is planning to stop gas supplies in the EU in winter.
Later, Minister of Energy in Russia, Alexander Novak, told me that the talks are inseparable.
He said that Russia will do everything in its power to deliver gas to the EU countries.
The liberal alloggari received ten years of imprisonment and a thousand balconies.
The Saudi court has held a ten-year prison sentence for Raif Badawi, the founder of the Free Saudi Liberals movement.
The judgment includes, as an additional penalty, a thousand stripes and a million fines (approximately EUR 200 000).
The judgment was based on the fact that he had established Islam as a cheap website.
On Monday, AFP was informed of the judgment by another founder of Suad al-Shamari.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was already sentenced to seven years of imprisonment in July 2013 and 600 breeches, but the judgment was appealed and returned to trial.
The judgment was also appealed in May, when Amnesty International also pointed out its injustice.
Madventures Riku Ranalan's childhood experience in Afghanistan: "It was one of the fashionable human scenes"
The Madventures published today a new book, World Explanation, an adventurer's explanation of everything.
We asked Mr Rantala about the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
It also tells us about the most important human contact in our lives.
The author, the journalist, the other half of Madventures, Riku Rantala, is a busy man.
Today, a new book has been published, yesterday there was a filmmaker in Citizens' Square, and Wednesday the second production period of Ylelle Docventures begins.
Ever since morning, he's been running from place to place.
From the morning-tv of the Mayor to take the child to the day care and to the weekly staff.
The most agreed interview is to be submitted for a phone interview.
You don't have time for that.
In the midst of everything he and Madventures have had time to stop and write the World Explanation book, which according to the cover of the book, an adventurer's handbook for everything.
All of it?
Wow, a lot of promised.
The book discusses a number of themes, such as what is our future, why another culture works worse than the other, why we are here and who we really are.
We used the interviews we've been doing over the years.
The book includes experts both professors and artists.
We worked actively for about a year, and Riku will tell IS by phone.
You've buried a pretty big piece in the book.
What is the main message of the book?
The need to know more about the world and the big questions is worth considering, because we are doing the best in this world.
On the other hand, the title of the book is to be good reading, but it is also intended to allow people to discuss and share ideas at home.
The debate can even lead to action, Rku tells us.
KUVA: Pete Aarre-Ahtio
One of the themes of your book is the future of the world.
What does it look like?
We have come to the conclusion that the human race is optimistic.
Despite global warming and the current state of the earth, it is necessary to believe that, at some point, we will make decisions to improve our situation.
The earth is a sort of alcoholic.
First, it should admit that we have a problem, only then can change, Riku philosophi.
According to some studies, Western mankind has reached the peak of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, prosperity has not increased our happiness.
This shows that when there is enough money and our basic needs are satisfied, we are happy.
Money doesn't add to happiness.
We want to wake people up to discuss what is enough.
Taking advantage of our natural resources is not enough for long enough, Riku says.
You are also considering cultural differences in your book.
How does an Indian person differ from Finnish?
People don't exactly differ.
Of course, the starting points for education, health and hygiene are different.
The most culturally big difference is that the Community's importance in India is far greater in terms of both good and bad.
When the Western worlds are prosperous, people live more alone.
Let us isolate ourselves and may lead to loneliness and anxiety.
When we find a suitable balance between sociality and loneliness, we'd be pretty close to happiness, Riku tells us.
There's been a lot of different people in the world.
What human contact has been the best way to get to his mind?
It's about my childhood when I was with my family on my first big trip abroad.
We lived in India and Pakistan for a year while my father was there at the UN.
I was seven years old, and my two smaller sisters were involved.
My brother was just a baby, Riku to set up.
Home to Finland was picked up in a big truck.
We were going to war in Afghanistan when there were a huge number of refugees on the road.
On the road, a girl of my age walked with her little brother in her arms.
I was sitting on a big mermaid bench with a coke cane in my hand.
Our eyes crossed, Riku describes.
A child of your age understands the situation.
It was one of the mulling human scenes I'll always remember.
KUVA: Leena Koskela
Rku and Tunna at the 2013 book fair.
At that time, the Rkus "go into the heel" said that other people must be respected, even if they were much poorer, or they would not have the same conditions of life as we do.
That's when the crime realized that money can't be a medal for human dignity.
From the memories of adults to the surface, people in New Guinea will rise.
I couldn't stop wondering how people were traditionally living there.
They use natural materials to benefit from everything, not just use money or metal tools.
They live under very challenging living conditions.
It's really hard to survive.
It made me think.
And to think about it, she wants to get her new book readers, too.
The idea is that our book inspires people to read, see and listen more.
To make people act from warm love to conversation or even a fist fight, Rku throws.
It's about the Kahahajoki newspaper.
The events took off when the couple arrived on the bus to the station and ordered a cab.
When the cab went off, the man in the yard threw some thing behind the cab.
The driver got out of the car, the same man as the passenger.
The man who threw the performer stabbed the male passenger life-threateningly in the head and in the hand and left the place.
The stabilizer is a tank of 170 to 175 cents, a short-haired man.
According to the newspaper, there has been a young, light pony-tailed woman in the vicinity of the event site.
They're hoping he'll be in touch with the police.
The police are also asking for clues for any person who may have made observations about the events or the persons involved in the case.
The stabilization occurred on Wednesday, 27 August at 19.50 p.m.
"Moi!" said the brain - the world's first telepathic message passed through the Internet.
The publication PLOS ONE has published an article saying that the international team of researchers has been the first to communicate the message directly to the mind.
The first messages I sent through the system were "hola" and "ciao", i.e. "moi" in Spanish and Italian.
During the experiment, the electrical brain curve of the sending tester was observed.
The sender was trained with the help of the program to send bits, either by thinking of hand or leg movement.
The imagination of the leg movement was interpreted as zero, and the movement of hands into one.
This bit coded information was sent via the Internet to the recipient.
The recipient was caused by magnetic stimulation to observe a light discharge per bit encoded into each of the first.
The recipient was taught to interpret flashes as a message.
Researchers acknowledge that this is still an area of study in children’s shoes, but believe that computerised telepathic communication is routine in the near future of mankind.
Packages - Point - Future of rural areas
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also tightening its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States to react when Russia fought in Ukraine and occupied Crimea.
In international policy, action is followed by reaction, response.
Experience shows that all sanctions are only in the long run.
Iran was given a tendency to negotiate its nuclear programme only after years.
For decades, the South African Revolutionary Government was sitting in place, even though trade was prohibited by UN decisions.
Penalties have also been used against Russia.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was not allowed to carry high-level electronics or military technology.
Russia itself has put barriers to trade on the world page.
The last of these cases were frozen in the timber trade.
It is clear that the sanctions will not bring Russia to its knees.
The Russians are used to bad times, and the disappearance of Viola from the store is not causing panic.
When the EU intends to ban vodka imports from Russia, it is mainly a joke.
The Russians would love to drink that vodka for themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to take air-report ships to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
The gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The main disadvantage for Russia is not to steal cheese or vodka.
The financial sector is most affected.
They don't work until the future.
The Russian State cannot operate on the international loan market.
It has to shorten old loans, but it's hard to take a new one.
Although Russia has enormous foreign reserves, they do not last forever.
The availability of credit for Russian companies is fading and the money is costing.
My own banks are not able to finance everyone.
We need to press more money, or companies will have problems with the payment.
Competitions are also competitions in Russia, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, the modernisation of Russia will stop, as the Russian expert René Nyberg wrote in Helsinki's Word.
It wouldn't be the first time.
On the other hand, Russia would once again return to Russia and step in.
An exceptional free press event was held in North Korea
About 10,000 North Koreans, as well as a number of diplomats, followed by international free competitions held in Pjongjang on Saturday.
Antonio Inoki, a Japanese lawyer, made a free button from the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico, took part in the event.
In addition to free button matches, local athletes' taekwondo matches were also seen.
According to the Inok, the aim of the event was to bring together the contested states and promote world peace through sport.
In their speeches, the politicians called for improvements between North Korea and Japan.
In the summer, Japan removed the sanctions it had imposed on North Korea as a result of the Japanese kidnappings in the 1970s and 1980s.
North Korea, for its part, promised to reopen the investigation into the cases in question.
The latter was seen in North Korea in 1995.
SOK reduces about 110 people from the stock trade organisation.
The Yt negotiations started in June, when a reduction need was estimated at no more than 130.
According to the company, its organisation now has overlapping functions and areas of responsibility have been clarified.
SOK tells us that it is seeking more cost-effectiveness and synergies between different sectors of activity.
In addition to the economic downturn and the decline in consumer demand, there is a change in the structure of trade, which has in particular shaken trade in goods.
The result of the S Group's commodity trade has been lost for some time.
The Yt negotiations concerned all employees and management of the SOK’s daily asset trade, i.e. about 530 persons.
Turku Words: Some of the self-medications behind the counter
According to the newspaper, more medicines are coming between prescription drugs and medicines taken from the shelf, but only after advice from the pharmacist.
According to the Finnish Pharmacopoeia Association, eye drops containing antibiotics, for example, could become subject to advice.
After an interview with the pharmacist or pharmacist and meeting the pre-defined criteria, the medicinal product could be given behind the counter, the president of the Farm Association will consider Kirsi Kvarnström Turku Sanoma.
In Finland, some medicines are already available without a prescription, but they require advice.
One of these is a follow-up product.
Corruption with more specific causes
Finland will pay more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by the OECD as well as by the Council of Europe, as the world is stunned by the limited number of bribes and judgments in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Ministry of Justice's working group will consider the need for a criminal law on trade and abuse of influence.
The differences in legislation emerged, for example, in the case of the Slovenian branch of Patria, in Hämeenlinna a year ago.
In Slovenia, trade in influence brought a two-year prison sentence to the former Prime Minister, but Finland's law does not know the same criminal code.
The anti-corruption cooperation network has strengthened its cooperation as required by the Government Programme.
According to the recently completed survey, corruption is not much studied in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered a report of corruption in various areas from the University of Riga and from the College of Police College.

Wanderers Coach Tony Popovic believes he's gonna get the tourers for the Olympic Championships League fight in Korea.
Tony Popovic lacks three key players in Korea.
Many of the players in the Western Sydney Wanderers team are in the game ban in the first match, and Coach Tony Popovic does not hesitate to throw other players into the Asian Championships League witchhouse FC Seoul.
The Wanderers are in Dubai on a 10-day training camp, including two friends in Abu Dhab, so that the team can prepare for the first semifinal of September 17th.
Due to excessive yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole skip Korea, but Coach Popovic believes in their tourers.
"Of course, this is a loss – they have been three very important players in ACL for us," says Popovic.
Tomi Juric was banned from this gesture in China.
I mean, it's a setback, not one of the players should be gone, but we didn't have Mattya (Spiranovic) in the first game, and so far Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Whoever comes in, I'm sure he's been working a lot, and I'm counting on the whole team.
I'm not afraid to play who only I'm against in the semifinals.
The Wanderers will also have to be without Spiranovich, who will continue to recover from the ankle surgery.
The defender of the Socceroos team was injured before the beginning of the season, but has continued running, and it is possible that he will play the return game at the Pirtek stadium on 1 October.
"He's back in the career and he's gonna be fine," says Popovic.
He follows his own training program and leaves with us to Dubai, which is a great news for him, because it means gradually returning to the field.
He's been practicing out a couple of times, which is good.
It's gonna take a while before she's completely fine, but she's gonna be fine.
In Dubai, the Wanders team has the world's top representative facilities at the Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic's view is also a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after the great changes of the end of the last season.
"We know this will help the players to create ties," Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players, and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better both on the field and outside.
So we're taking advantage of the camp for a number of reasons.
Eliti's burger pays three times the employee's monthly salary
01.09.2014 21:18 In North Korea, you can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if you happen to be part of the country’s elite.
The financial Times is telling us about how to tear the opposites from the economy.
In North Korea, non-formal markets may flourish more than ever.
They offer the wealthy or sustainable ordinary citizens a luxury that has not been used to unite in a dictatorship.
The Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: an entertainment centre where only a ticket is paid for up to 10 months of ordinary workers' salary.
You're gonna get burgers out of this place, and they're gonna pay $76.
It's three to five months' salary for a regular duunar in the country.
In the pool, men drink beer in their shorts.
Life looks expensive and nice.
In the 1990s, North Korea's "Municipal Market" started when the country suffered from famine.
The government allows them to exist, even though the prices of supplies can be severe.
Yet, in Pjongjang, many have a mobile phone with a door of $200.
Partiality can be in the ruler's Kim Jong-un, 31, who has tried to create a self-energy and youthful picture.
During his time, the administration has stressed the importance of technology in the coup of the earth.

Ormiston House: Stormont Council wishes to sell
The Stormont Council is hopeful that it has found a buyer at Ormiston House, Belfast, a building that cost taxpayers nearly $3,000 a week.
The Council bought a building in the eastern parts of the city from the 1800s 13 years ago and paid 9 million pounds of it.
The Council was unable to continue to sell the building, when the building's safety and maintenance came to the Council to pay about 400 pounds a day.
The building was sold by 1.25 million pounds.
Apparently, the building will be used as a private residential building.
The Council bought an historic class B building with 9 million pounds in 2001 because it needed more office space.
However, it was subsequently found that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the building was purchased, it was rescheduled to the sale while the price was at this time 2,5 million pounds.
The building was not sold, and the price was calculated.
Last year, Mike Nesbit, the Ulster Unionist Party, suggested that Ormiston House might fit into the premises of a new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it will negotiate the sale of the building.
According to the rapporteur, the building will be transferred to the new owner as long as the paperwork is completed.
Both the Council and the real estate agent remain silent about the identity of the buyer and the sales price.
The weekly security and repair costs of Ormiston House are about 3 000 pounds.
The Council bought a building from the police force, which preceded Northern Ireland's Police Board.
The safety costs of Ormiston House by the beginning of this year were 885 641 pounds and maintenance costs 371 379 pounds.
The cost of repair and maintenance professional services was 250 015 and the fees for development and design professionals were 212 466.
In the past, the building was owned by Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when it was purchased by William Pirrie, a business associate of Harland, who later became the chairman of Harland & Wolff.
Soon after Lord Pirrie died, 1924 Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building, and the company sold it to Campbell College, which held it until mid-70s.
"Employment increases": Helsinki intends to reduce school leave workers
There's no savings, says JHL.
In Helsinki, a radical reduction of the number of school-specific helpers is being prepared.
The reduction would not apply to the child’s personal assistant.
In the spring, the Helsinki Board of Education concluded to present a total of about 2.7 million people out of the staff's resources.
In Helsinki, there are about 600 educational assistants.
If the contractions take place, they will enter into force at the beginning of the year in the middle of the semester.
According to the trade union JHL, the decision increases inequalities.
More and more children need support for learning.
However, it is regrettable that donors are easy to reduce because the amount of aid for learning is not clearly defined in law.
There is no guarantee that savings will be created, on the contrary, the labour burden of teaching staff will increase.
At school level, savings lead to an even greater risk of falling from learning goals and the division of teachers is hard, stressing Mr Niemi-Laine, Head of Industry of JHL.
The plans of the City of Helsinki are different from those of schools, because in future resources, small schools and students need support will no longer receive assistant resources at all.
The goal of the City of Helsinki is to prevent exclusion.
Effective preventive work is precisely done by school assistants.
However, the adaptation measures of the educational agency have been aimed at this group for the most part.
All parties will continue to suffer from this.
In autumn, the final solution to the resources will be made by the City Council of Helsinki, to which I hope the vision and wisdom of looking forward to the future and to act in accordance with its objectives, says Niemi-Laine.
Israel’s Power in the West Bank
The women of Israel walk in the Jewish settlement of Gevaot near Bethlehem.
On Sunday, Israel took over almost 400 hectares of land in the West Bank near Bethlehem. This may be a sign of Israel’s future significant construction in the region, and at the same time it undermines the request of the Palestinians not to build more settlements and threaten the general opinion of the world community.
The Israeli "Peace Now" group, which is opposed to the expansion of the West Bank institutions, considered that Sunday events could have been the biggest individual land takeover in the West Bank for decades and could "ammally change the situation of the region".
The goal of the Palestinians is to establish a state of their own for the countries which Israel conquered in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, the political effort to assess the situation in the land became after the three Israelis were kidnapped and killed in June after their lift in the region.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested the Palestinians, accused of kidnappings and killings.
The timing of the land takeover suggests that it was intended for a kind of compensation for the population of the settlement and punishment for the Palestinian people.
The territory of the land near the Jewish Gevaot facility of South Jerusalem, Etzion, has now been officially declared a "country", before it was a private property of the Palestinians. This was a necessary step to allow Israel to begin planning buildings if they wish to do so.
However, the Mayor of Surif, a nearby Palestinian city, Ahmad Lafi, said that the country belongs to the Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian official news office WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff had early published provisions in which Israel announced that it would take over the land of Surif and the nearby villages Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin's olive and other trees.
Any objections shall be made within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people received discipline from the Israeli army on the West Bank against Hamas, the Islamic group ruling Gaza, which Israel said was behind the kidnappings.
The tensions followed on the border of Israel and Gaza, in the 50 - day war that ended last week in Egypt’s ceasefire.
It has quickly drawn attention to the West Bank dominated by the Israelis and revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli government, which hamper the wider development of the peace process between Israel and Palestine.
Children’s crisis communities are usually multi-problem
The vast majority of the municipalities of Lapland are in trouble, reports from well-being studies prepared by the University of Lapland and the University of Applied Sciences.
There are no quick solutions to the problems of the crisis.
According to the professor, the reduction of municipal tasks by EUR 1 billion is not enough.
The common features of the crisis include the weak urban economy, poor employment and migration.
According to Professor Asko Suikkanen of Sociology at the University of Lappa, new crisis circles are coming from the western border and East Lapp.
In the survey questionnaire, the population assessed their condition in a rather realistic way.
In the study, the inhabitants of well - equipped municipalities were even pessimistic.
High expectations affect consumption.
People hope that today's daily life and well-being will remain, perhaps even a little better.
In this time, it is not dared to think about longer-term investments, such as buying a dwelling, says Suikkanen.
The investigator group surprised the major differences between municipalities.
For example, income support expenditure per capita varies from two to tens to more than one hundred euros.
The tax revenue received by the municipality per capita varies from EUR 2 000 to EUR 4400 in Ranua.
According to the shuttle, the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How money is spent, how much public contributions are received, and what is the degree of debt, is much different even in the same situations, he says.

United Kingdom may exclude from the return of borders from Islamic competitors
The United Kingdom may temporarily prevent the return of Islamic artists who left Iraq and Syria to their homeland.
BBC tells us about this, referring to government sources.
According to the BBC, British citizens suspected of terrorism should, however, retain their citizenship.
According to the government source, this is one of the many proposals that will be considered.
The proposal is being finalised and Prime Minister David Cameron is due to present it.
The government is also looking for ways to make it difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way to increase the powers of the authorities may be so that they can temporarily seize the passports of potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, Britain raised the possibility of terrorism to the second highest level.
Bob Carr is delighted by the immediate release of the Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor from a liblya prison.
A Australian lawyer, Melinda Taylor, is expected to be released from a Liberian prison today.
The Federal Government was pleased with the news that the authorities in Libya are expected to release Australian attorney Melinda Taylor today.
Foreign Minister Bob Carr said that "all goes well" and an international criminal lawyer will be released from his custody by the Australian authorities this evening, after which he will board a plane flying to Europe by midnight.
"We are happy with the news that he is likely to be released today", the representative commented on the matter to the AAP News Office in New York.
We thank the authorities in Libya for their cooperation.
Australia also thanked the wider international community for their help and support, the representative said.
Taylor is likely to fly to Rome before the trip to his home in The Hague.
Taylor and his three criminal lawyers were arrested on 7 June in the city of Zintan, Libya, in representing Seif al-Islam, the son of Muammar Gaddafi, the former dictator of Libya.
According to the authorities of Libya, Taylor took the papers that they think threatened national security.
Senator Carr has been working hard to free Taylor, and he traveled to the city of Libya last month to drive this thing.
Taylor couldn't have talked to his husband or his little daughter until last week.
According to Senator Carr, Taylor was allowed to make a short call to his home in The Hague shortly after his visit to the Australian ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also talked with the parents of Taylor's Brisbane, John and Janelle, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally given a phone call.
Taylor's parents had been betting on Libya to free their daughter before this little baby's third birthday in July.
Three other arresting lawyers are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr said a week ago that as a result of a debate between a lawyer released in The Hague and the Libyan authorities, "the criminal lawyer was sorry and apologized for a possible misunderstanding".
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of mistakes, but has promised to examine the actions of its team thoroughly when its members return home.
"After the decision of the International Criminal Court, it will ensure that everyone who has wronged comes to judgment in due course", the Court announced in its communication last month.
The International Criminal Court is calling for a trial for 39-year-old Seif al-Islam against humanity during his father's term of office, which ended suddenly last year.
According to Tripoli, his trial should be local and took the initiative on 1 May in which he announced that he would not accept the decision of the criminal lawyer to hold the trial in The Hague.
The young newcomer saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona took its second victory at the early stages of the Spanish football league, but with ease Villarreal did not fall at home.
The blue-red kisses in the head of the Villarreal guard Sergio Assenjone until 82 minutes finally made it.
A surprising man made the victory goal: 19 years old, his first appearance in La Liga made an attacker named Sandro Ramirez had only come to the field 12 minutes earlier.
From the second squad in Barcelona, the young man who received the call from the delegation team finished close by the time Asenjo rejected Lionel Mess's company.
Collections to Ferguson P.D. ended mysteriously after $433 000.
The surprises closed down two online collection sites without explaining this weekend when the sites were collected for over $400 000 for a police officer who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, the state of Missour.
For the general public, on the GoFundMe High Quality Website, two separate pages, bearing similar names – "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson" – have collected 235 750 dollars and 197,620 dollars for a Ferguson-like police officer who shot Michael Brown.
A similar site, maintained by Brown's family attorney, had collected $314 099 after Sunday afternoon.
Many weeks of shooting followed the unrest and demonstration most of the Ferguson, which black people mostly lived against almost white police forces, forced Wilson to hide while trying to determine whether he was shooting Brown for no reason.
The campaign to collect the network has brought some concerns about the defence of Wilson, especially since some visitors had written a comment on racist comments that have been deleted since then.
Apparently, both pages ceased to receive donations at the same time on Saturday, and the administrators of the pages gave no reason to do so.
When trying to give a donation to the site, he sees a message saying, "Don't be accepted anymore!
The organiser has ceased to collect donations.
On Sunday, a representative of the GoFundMe site gave a report to the Los Angeles Times that the site did not prevent donations from being made.
"Every GoFundMe campaign operator will decide for himself when to stop receiving donations," said Kelsea Little, representative of GoFundMe.
Organizers can also, if they wish, continue to receive donations later.
The "Support Officer Wilson" page, with a return of $197,620, maintains a charity group composed of the police at St. Louis, the recipient of donations approved by the GoFundMe website.
Three police officers designated as official representatives of the Shipd of Hope County Register by Joseph Eag, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda did not respond immediately to e-mails asking for further information on the collection campaign on Sunday.
Zoll is an official informant of the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a member of the Florissant City Council and a member of the Roorda Missour House.
Nor did the Times immediately contact the anonymous founder of the "Support Office Darren Wilson" page, who uses the name "Stand Up" and has collected 235 750 dollars, which has not been confirmed by the website to accept donations as recipients.
However, a representative of the GoFundMe site assured the Times in his announcement that an anonymous benefactor exists.
There is little information available to donors about the anonymous charity of the collection campaign, unlike those on another Wilson or Brown dilution site.
An anonymous Wilson page benefactor wrote a message to visitors two weeks ago that the page cooperates with the Shield of Hope group to become officially approved recipients of donations.
The approval has not yet been granted.
He gave more information to wanted visitors on the Gmail password, but he did not reply immediately on Sunday to the request for further information.
In his release to the Times, the representative of GoFundMe said that the anonymous collection page has been removed from the search results of the main website and added that "this campaign no longer meets the requirements of the GoFundMe website, according to which an operational Facebook account should be used".
In the information security practices of the GoFundMe website, users are invited to "departate only to the users of GoFundMe who they know personally and to be trusted".
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the content of the collection page published on the GoFundMe website is correct and honest.
According to Mr Litlen, however, GoFundMe has been in contact with the campaign organiser and has no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to arrest all the funds collected if research is needed in connection with a campaign.
However, GoFundMe has not considered it appropriate to arrest the funds collected by that campaign.
The recommended Facebook page "Support Officer Wilson", which has organised campaigns supporting Wilson, told the following people this weekend that lawyers are trying to find a "exhibition" why the donors of the GoFundMe website have been prevented from being donated, but the page did not provide any further information.
There is also an anonymous administrator on the Facebook page and the independent source has not been able to confirm these comments.
Arsenal's top performer on the page of the year - Valoli with Ilta-Sanomat
With England's Valoli, Arsenal's French worker Olivier Giroud is probably on the side until the turn of the year.
Giroud’s ankle was cut on Wednesday and recovery takes months.
Giroud hurt his leg this weekend in the Valoliiga match against Everton.
The operation went well, but he's on the side until he can play at the top level, until the end of December or early January, Arsenal's chief coach Arsene Wenger told Sky Sports.
Giroud was the best goalmaker in Arsenal last season with 16 hits, so the loss is felt.
According to Wenger, however, he may not be able to get Giroud a location during this transfer window anymore.
Wenger was afraid of fresh procurement at Alexis Sanchezia's peak on Wednesday in the Karsintafini of the Masters' league against Besiktsia.
Arsenal won 1-0 on the Sanchez goal.
